Mira Kelley <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MiraKelley" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/@MiraKelley</a><br><br><br>Hello everyone, welcome. I am Mira Kelley, and I'm so thrilled to introduce you to Christian Sundberg. Today, we are going to have such a thrilling, exciting conversation. When I came across Christian's story, all I could think of right away was that I needed to share this with you. I needed to learn more. We need to know about this.  <br>We were introduced by a mutual acquaintance who reached out to me—a man based in Italy looking to put together a book on the experiences of people who have lost children, to bring comfort to mothers. He was looking to interview me to hear my thoughts on the subject to include that in his book. In our conversation, I got to learn about you, Christian. So, hello and welcome.  <br>Christian: Thank you.  <br>Mira: It's not her. Thank you. The owner is absolutely ours. As I just mentioned, I think this is very important for people to hear, and so I really appreciate what you're doing. Thank you very much.  <br>Christian: Thank you.  <br>Mira: What I really loved about your story right away was what this man shared with me—that you remember your experience, your existence before birth here on Earth. I was so intrigued by that. I was like, "Oh my God, we have to talk to him." So, I would love to know more. Please take us right in.  <br><br><br>Christian: Sure. Well, it's kind of a big story, and it's too hard to articulate. In fact, most of it is just beyond language. I find there's a really hard time trying to put words on any of this because words are of our local world. They're forms, symbols, and where we come from transcends all the symbols of Earth. It's bigger than anything we can put words to. But anyway, that disclaimer being said, I guess I'll try to go in order. But even order is a little bit fuzzy here because these experiences do have a sequence, but they also simultaneously kind of are happening at once. Like, even right now, I feel like these experiences are not so much in the past; they're kind of now, even though some were before others. So, I don't know how to really articulate that.  <br>Mira: You're talking to the right people because my audience has already heard me talk about simultaneous time. So, everybody, I imagine, is integrated. Hey, we're with you. That's great.  <br>Christian: Yeah. So, my earliest memory—first of all, the memory that I have is connected with my journey here. The memory that I have—so, I had memory when I was a child in this life, and I assumed everybody did for a while. Then, eventually, when I got to be about seven or so years old, I had forgotten it. It returned at about the age of thirty. I'm 38 right now. It returned after I had gone to a certain path of spiritual awakening and meditation. As the memory has returned to me, it's come in a way that is helpful for my purpose. So, there are aspects of my memory which are blocked off still, and that's okay with me now. I respect the larger purposes at work here.  <br><br><br>But I do remember a very long time ago—and some of this might sound strange—but I remember a very long time ago, before I was ever physical, before I had any physical incarnation at all, being inspired by a being that I had come across who had been physical, who had had physical experiences as some physical being. It doesn't matter what he was. I just know that I came across this being, and I remember being overwhelmed and inspired by the quality of his essence, his nature. It was so beautiful and full of light and joy and power.  <br>I remember asking him—and again, these aren't words; it's all telepathic. There are thoughts shared, information—but I asked, "My goodness, like, look at what you've become. How did you do this? What did you possibly do to be this? And are you filled with as much joy as it looks like you're filled with?" And he said, "Yes, I am." And he shared with me this depth of quality of being that he had, and I was absolutely inspired.  <br>I asked him how he had done it, and he showed me that he had lived. He had showed me several things, but one primary experience he had had was that he had been physical and had had a chronic health problem—some kind of pain or sickness that lasted for many years. He had to deal with that, and it boiled down to how he chose to meet that experience. The quality with which he met that experience allowed a certain refinement of his being, I guess that's the only way I can describe it.  <br>I was so inspired. I said, "Oh, and you bet I want to do that. I am gonna do that." And I was so—you know, just—I was really inspired. And he kind of said, "Yeah, that's kind of what they all say," brushing me off in a playful way. And I said, "No, I'm serious. I want to do that." And so, well, "Go talk to your guides."  <br>So, I went. I found my guides, and I explained. And then—I don't remember immediately after that, but I know that I lived many times after that.  <br><br><br>Mira: I have to talk to you right here. So sorry to interrupt. I just have to ask a question and comment. What you just said about this being having had this chronic illness—you just gave so much hope to so many people who have chronic conditions, right? We're dealing with a serious illness because, you know, you just showed them the bigger purpose of it, right? A different approach—how it can be taken and seen rather than, "My body is a victim, and I'm victimized by needing to go do something," instead of the path to that greater spiritual growth and awakening, right?  <br>Christian: For you tonight, I want to say that growth and awakening is permanent. It's eternal. And so, the temporary experience of illness or chronic distress or whatever is worth the price to the bold spirit who wishes to grow. And to us who are here, we resist. You know, where you're like, "I don't like this." Oh yeah, we fight it. The deeper parts of us know that we are eternal. We don't—we have nothing ultimately to fear. And we know that the experience may seem very real and unrelenting when we're here. It feels unrelenting. You know, I'm here. I'm a human right now. I know. But it's not. It's just a very deep dream.  <br>Mira: Where were you able to gather what was that quality that this being met his illness with? Because you said it was a particular way. So, we're definitely not talking about begrudgingly and regretfully. It was something different. What was the impression that was left in you?  <br>Christian: That's a really good question. The best way I can put it is willingness and openness. And there are no words for this. I think it's more like a quality of love that he brought even into that pain. And it was a quality of his intent—a term I like to use, "quality of intent," that comes from the physicist and consciousness explorer Tom Campbell. It's a beautiful term. This being had a quality of intent when he met his experience, and it was not easy.  <br>Mira: We all have that opportunity. I mean, that's the thing. The thing that inspires me—the thing about your message that's so inspiring—is that we don't have to move mountains in this life. We just have to meet our experience. And it's the small things that have the most power. It's choosing love over fear. It's choosing willingness over resistance, even in small moments. There's so much power there. And as humans who are consumed by human drama, we forget that.  <br>Christian: It's just the opportunity that is available to us as humans is amazing. And if there's one message I could just—I just hope to share as someone who remembers—this is an opportunity. In fact, being human is like one of the most precious gifts you could possibly be given. When you realize that you're given an opportunity to actually play this character, you're like, "Wow, I'm so honored." And it's just a profound opportunity.  <br>I know that's hard to remember when we're suffering. I've suffered a lot in this life physically, and I knew that I would. But it is an opportunity.  <br><br><br>Mira: It's listening to you, and I feel that energy because, my gosh, your words—you're also transmitting that vibration, the quality of what you felt. And I'm feeling it in my heart now too. So, thank you.  <br>Christian: Thank you.  <br>Mira: And so, there you are. You're so inspired by another soul, and he tells you, "Go talk to your guides."  <br>Christian: Yes. So, I lived many lives, and then I went back and found him later. And I said, "I'm not all the way there yet, but see, I've done some of this." And I shared with him, and he was encouraging. But I knew I wasn't done yet.  <br>So now—okay, so now I'm going to jump a bit because I don't know exactly how all the sequence happens here. But I remember—and this is going to sound very strange, and I would only share this with this kind of groovy audience—I honestly remember the moment that the universe—our universe—was to be created, that the intention was being issued forth from Source and from all of us. We were all involved to take this to like the next level and to have this next level rigorous, deep experience of being physical.  <br>I don't remember being around when the universe was created. I wasn't there at the very beginning. I was doing something else. I don't know what I was doing, but I was doing something. But I remember coming early when the galaxies were young, and there were just stars. And I remember soaring amongst the stars and being filled with so much excitement. It's all the excitement of the opportunity to play in this game. I can't stress enough how exciting it is to the spirit to have the opportunity.  <br>I mean, it was like, "Wow, we actually get to be these things—these people, these creatures, whatever we're gonna be. We actually get to be that and experience that." And it's so exciting because we know, from that perspective, what an opportunity that is for us to integrate experience and to expand and to grow and to express our creative natures and to be and to express love and to grow in love. It's just a huge opportunity.  <br>But I knew even then, like, "Wow, this is—oh, this is a hard level." You know, not an easy level—a hard level game room or something. You know, again, the words just aren't there. But anyway, so I remember that. And then I had some other experiences.  <br><br><br>And then the majority of my memory is regarding a time somewhat immediately preceding this life, where I had taken a long break because I just decided I was taking a long break. So, I frolicked for a long time in this realm of gold and light, just having fun and joy and just like having a very long weekend that I just was reluctant to give up.  <br>And I remember—I really wanted to—okay, so I want to get back in the game because there was a very old fear that had bested me in a past experience, so to speak. And so, I remember this guide coming to me relatively often and asking, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready yet? Are you ready yet?" And putting him off for a while and eventually saying, "Okay, I'm ready."  <br>And then going over with him, kind of like my state—what I had done, what I had been, who I was. And it was very obvious the thing that I needed to work on. I had many qualities, but there was a great weakness, and it had bested me in a previous experience. And the best way I can put it is that it was a fear. And this fear in a past life had caused me to die an agonizing death. I died painfully.  <br>Mira: Here is something to the effect of inability to escape agony or pain, mixed with a being too proud to suffer, I guess is the only way I can put it. It's a certain vibration. And this vibration had—in that life, I was not a nice person. And I caused a lot of damage to others and to myself. And I really yearned to face that again and to integrate it.  <br>And I wanted to do that not because I had to or something, but because I knew—this is hard to explain, but it's very important—I knew that the opportunity to go such a distance away from Source and integrate that distance—if I could do that, the power expansion would be unfathomably beautiful and powerful and wonderful.  <br>And so, I remember asking the guide—  <br>Mira: I have to interrupt again because what you just said is profound. You just gave the answer—the example, I should say—to what I've been teaching. Karma is not anything other than the self-imposed desire to do better. It's not judgment. It's not that you've been a bad person and now you have to suffer. It's the desire for growth and balancing out. And you said it so beautifully. Thank you.  <br>Christian: Thank you.  <br>Mira: That's why it's so great to hear you say it because I feel like I live in a world where many—so many have forgotten. And it's important that we remind each other.  <br>Christian: Anyway, it's like you said. It's not that there's a requirement. It's that we see who we are. We see in a life review. You see who you actually were. There's not a judgment needed because you know exactly who you were. You know if you were loving or fearful or how you affected others. There's no hiding.  <br>Well, I had not been nice in this life. I had caused many others to suffer. So, I wanted to re-engage this fear. And I wanted to do it, but I thought, "Is it even possible?" I mean, I thought, "This fear is one of the greatest fears I've ever beheld." And I asked my guide, "Has it ever been done in all of creation? Has any other being ever done this?" And I was told, "Yes, and you have all of eternity to do so. You call time. There's no hurry."  <br>And I thought very confidently, "Well, if it can be done, I can do it." I just knew that. I just knew if it's possible within all that is, I won't do it. So, they brought me into life, and it was perfect for this purpose. And I reviewed it, and I accepted it. And I accepted the veil, which is very—the forgetfulness.  <br><br><br>Yeah, and that is the thing I remember the most about all of this—the process of accepting the veil. And I feel like even right now, I'm looking right at it. I can't see through it, but it's like looking at one of those—I don't know—like in the cop shows, there's like a pane of glass where you can see one way, but you can't see the other. I feel like I'm standing right on the other side of the glass. I know they can see me, and I know the glass is there even though I can't see it, and I can feel it.  <br>But anyway, so I accepted the veil in this life. And the vibration—the vibrational drama—was so significant and so low that I was instantly completely terrified within moments. I wasn't even born yet. I was just full of the darkness and the separation and the lack of knowledge.  <br>Because when the veil comes over you, it's like all of a sudden, you feel like you're not the whole anymore. You're not all that is. Now, you're separate. Now, you're in the dark. Now, you know nothing. And it could be terrifying. In this particular life, I don't get the sense that different lives have different vibrational places, and this one was quite low.  <br>And I panicked immediately. And this is very sad, but I mustered my might, and I smoked the veil. I rejected it, and I jumped back out because I killed the fetus. I killed the unborn child. And I had a life review for my very, very short life—like, I don't know, some very short amount of time.  <br>I had all these beautiful intentions going in. I really—I recited so much respect for the other players in the game—all of us, all my fellow spirits who were brave enough to be human. Man, I wanted to do that. I just so respected them. But when I was on the other side, I mainly saw that my fear had caused a miscarriage, and the poor mother was brought great sorrow. And not only her, but I knew then hundreds of other people whose lives had been made more difficult because of my fear.  <br>Mira: Five seconds in, you know, just right at the start.  <br>Christian: And I knew everything was okay because, on the other side, I mean, I feel sorrow now even as I think about it, but it's full of joy too because there's nothing wrong. I mean, when you're on the other side, you can see all as well. It's just a play. Everything's fine. But I was disappointed in myself because that opportunity was wasted. But I still wanted to do this.  <br><br><br>So, they eventually brought me this life. And I remember reviewing this vast flowchart—it's the best way I can describe it—of millions and millions of possibilities of how things would go over time. I remember even then thinking about it in numerical terms of age, yearly ages. And I remember reviewing qualities of my parents and how important they would be in fulfilling my mission.  <br>I knew that my father would instill confidence in me, and that confidence would be paramount to me doing this—beyond being able to meet this fear. And I knew that I should be male because being a man would give me a certain kind of focus and edge that I needed to meet the fear. And I knew—and I asked—I asked a lot of things. I said, "I want to be intelligent." Again, they knew that I had been intelligent in other lives, and they said, "Yes, you can do that."  <br>And I said, "You know, I don't want to forget everything this time. I want to remember a small amount—just enough." And they said, "You can do that, but it will make it even more difficult." And I knew why. I could sense because the contrast would be even greater. And I'm here to tell you, it has made this life more challenging because I miss home.  <br>It's a wonderful—I mean, this whole experience is wonderful, but I miss that state of being. And I'm not going to forsake this opportunity. I've spent a very long time in this life meeting it fully, and I intend to do so. But I'm just saying that I knew at the time that it would be hard to have some memory. And I knew that it was almost necessary to forget because the constraints of being human are so high, and the restriction of not remembering who you are is so great that it can be incredibly painful to remember who you are and still be here.  <br>In fact, not only can it be painful, but it's also just not feasible because you can't really go to work in the morning if you know that you're the Sun.  <br>Mira: So, anyway, I remember asking, and they said, "Yes." But the thing is, I knew that even that difficulty—even that contrast—was an opportunity for growth. And I knew that I was serving not only myself but I was serving the whole by agreeing to do that.  <br>So, I reviewed many, many avenues. And I knew that I would have certain opportunities. And I knew that a trauma would likely follow me in my 20s that would crush me and basically give me the opportunity to reinstate fear. And it did happen. And I had post-traumatic stress for about eight or so years, and it was quite serious. And I am going through counseling for some number of years, and I also went through my spiritual awakening process.  <br>And I've met that fear to a very large extent. So, I am here doing exactly what I came to do. And as I've done that, my memory has naturally returned as it is helpful for me—only and only really as it is helpful. But it is helpful because I'm inspired by my own intention.  <br>Anyway, so I planned this all out. And I don't remember actually saying yes. I remember there having to be a moment to say yes, but I didn't remember that moment.  <br><br><br>Mira: Sure. Before you continue, what else do you remember? How is this new life plan different than the first life plan that you aborted? Was it greatly different? How was it different?  <br>Christian: This current life was not as good as the last one in terms of being optimal for my purpose because my spirit has certain qualities that have to interface with the life. I'm strong in certain ways, and the life has to be able to work with that. And I'm weak in certain ways. The first life was like all around—I don't know if you imagine a score sheet or something, and all the numbers were high. You know, it was just really appropriate.  <br>Mira: So, go ahead. What was the reason the second life isn't that optimal? Why can't it be a ten-ten-ten everywhere for that?  <br>Christian: Like, I can't say it in terms of what circumstance or constraint is different specifically, but I can say that from the spiritual perspective, it's known that Earth only has so much. Earth is limited. So, like, there's only so many people. At any given time, there's only so many choices. There's only so many—  <br>Mira: It totally makes sense. Yes, like you said, the flowchart needs to interact with everybody else's flowchart.  <br>Christian: Yeah. Oh, actually, it's not—yeah, no, this constraint set was more about my body and my parents and the life context. That was what made it appropriate or not. And the body was important. I knew that this body had a limitation that other bodies do not. And I knew that other spirits would pass it up. They would not necessarily choose to be this human.  <br>And I have since studied nutrigenomics and studied how my DNA influences how my brain chemistry works and how I eat and my diet and things like that. And I have discovered that I have some rather unusual genetic makeup, and I've dealt with health challenges as a result. But I knew that beforehand.  <br>What I'm saying is that I knew that it would make things difficult in a way that was important because it would pressure my ego or something. It would provide a weight on my day-to-day experience that I needed to feel, I guess, is the best way I can put it.  <br>So, the second set of circumstances was very good. It just wasn't as efficient as the first one would have been. But it was still good. It was still very—you know, good. If I put a grade on it, maybe the first was 99%, and this was 87%. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just making up numbers.  <br>Mira: Yeah, something like that.  <br><br><br>Christian: Yeah. So, I remember then them telling me—I remember waiting. Oh, there's an important part I should mention. So, I knew that I was going to have to accept the veil again, and I didn't want to. I didn't want to fail again. So, I practiced in something like a veil acceptance simulator, I guess is what you could call it.  <br>There's like a room where you go, and a mock veil comes over you, and you practice surrendering to it. And it just basically scares you and makes you like you're ready to do that dive—you know, that jump. And I remember practicing that. And the real veil is more difficult than the simulator.  <br>I remember because when it was time for the real thing, I was so pumped. I was so excited. I had all my energy gathered. It's like before the life, you're so excited, and you just gather all this energy, and you're so ready to go on this new adventure. So, I was ready.  <br>And I remember my guide coming to me and suddenly very abruptly—I remember this getting my attention—like, "Go now." Like, very—almost rude, but not rude because the spirit is so—kind of freeing. Not off in la-la land, but so free that, like, you have to all of a sudden—now you're on Earth time, buddy. You got to go now.  <br>And so, I was like, "Okay, okay, now." And I remember this process where these beings—who I can only describe as technicians or tinkerers—help apply the veil to you. And I remember them asking me one last time, "Are you sure you want to do this? Because once you say yes, you're in. Once you're strapped in, you're in for the ride."  <br>And I said, "Yes." And I remember the veil coming over me and just truly focusing on basically just not fighting it—basically just letting it do its will. Like, letting go and just letting time pass so the veil could get a grip on me, and I could be wrapped in it.  <br>And that plummet—I remember very well the plummet of having my knowing cut off and having my connectedness disappear and feeling this—I can only describe it as like going into a vacuum. Like, the vacuum of space. No, there's just no air there. There's just no heat. There's no air. You just suddenly descend from perfect connectedness and life and vibrance and kinetic knowledge to just feeling alone and dark and cut off.  <br>It was terrifying. It was terrifying again. But I remember holding on and just like holding on and holding on and holding on. And then I remember sending a signal back through this little window—did it take back to the technicians—and getting one message back through, "Yes."  <br>And that little window, by the way, I feel is part of them. That's not really a window. It's part of why I remember. So, anyway, I held on for as long as I could, and they said, "Yes." And the veil took.  <br>And then I witnessed—so then I was in the womb, and I was there for a while. And eventually, I just decided, "You know what? I'm not doing this. This is so low vibration. This is so dark. I am NOT doing this." So, once again, I began to muster my might to fight my way out. I was not going to have it.  <br>And then the most beautiful thing happened. The only way I can put it is that the Spirit of God came to me—the Great Spirit of God. And it showed me all the galaxies and all the stars, and I knew that they were me, and I was them. And it said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this."  <br>It's very emotional because I can't tell you how personal that feeling is—what we are. You know, we are that love. And the Spirit reminded me of that, and it called me—you know, it called me enough that I could let go and just surrender to this simple experience of being in the womb.  <br>And my next memory is the shock of being born. And I have one visual image memory from the day I was born—just one. It was of the room after they pulled me out. And later in my life, I drew the room for my mother, and she just identified, "You were here. The doctor was here. Here was the window. Here was the heating grate." And I was right. Apparently, I mean, I knew I would be, but I just remember that one image.  <br>And being like, "I remember being like, 'What is this place? Where am I? This is so—who are these beings who are taking care of me? Like, what is going on?'" I remember there was no context yet. It was just sense data. It was just shock and cold and white and sound and people touching me, and someone is cutting my body, and you know, like, there's things going on.  <br>You know, like, I don't know. It was very shocking. And then what happened was a few weeks after that, as an infant, I almost died. In fact, this is a separate story, but I turned purple because I had some kind of a respiratory infection, and I wasn't breathing. And they rushed me to the hospital, and my father at the time sensed—he was working on a house. He was doing some kind of remodeling, and he just suddenly put down his work and said, "I don't know how I know, but Christian is in the hospital, and I need to go right now."  <br>This was before the day of cell phones, and he went to the hospital, and they baptized me in the hospital because I was going to die. But anyway, so I didn't die. I made it. I don't remember that event. I only remember that first shock of being born. I remember some stress near that period that I don't remember that time.  <br>But then, as I got older, I mean, I used to recall these memories, and I used to kind of cheat a little bit. I would kind of draw up on the flowchart memory and try to see what was going to happen. You know, like, I just—it was like peeking—you know, like, behind a veil or something and just going to happen tomorrow. You know, what? Just 'cause I was a kid. You're curious. You know, I was like, "Well, huh, that's weird. Well, what's going to happen when this person's going to come?"  <br>And eventually, I think it was some—it started getting cut off for me, especially around age five. It was like I was not allowed to cheat anymore. No way. I was getting thicker and thicker as I became more and more focused on the physical.  <br><br><br>But anyway, as a kid, I remember expecting that everybody knew that we weren't from here. I mean, everybody must know that this is just a game. You know, this is like this to come place. We come, and we're having a neat experience. And I assumed some things from the other reality were true here.  <br>For instance, I assumed that people could feel each other's emotions, which is very normal in other reality systems but not normal on Earth. And I remember one day as a little kid—I don't know how old, but I was young enough where I had only recently learned how to walk—and I remember being in a diaper, and I remember standing at this couch, and my parents had a neighbor friend over.  <br>And I remember there was this music on, and I told the neighbor, "Watch me dance." And I remember dancing to this funky music on the record player and shaking my little tush and feeling funky. And the woman walked away unimpressed, and I was like, "She can't feel what I'm feeling." And when I realized that, I was just dumbfounded. I was like, "Where the heck am I? What place is this that we can't feel each other's emotions? What is going on?"  <br>It made no sense to me. It was like—and I had other assumptions. You know, just things like I assumed that the higher someone was in society, the more loving and wise they were because, in other reality systems, the more powerful beings of love and wisdom just naturally have positions of leadership or power. You know, guides—they're loving and wise.  <br>It turned out not to be exceptionally true, but anyway, that list of the memories ended up kind of fading, as I said. And eventually, I didn't remember that at all. And when this began to return to me, it was like, "Oh my gosh, how did I ever forget that? How did I ever forget that?" You know, like, "I can't believe I forgot that. I mean, it's the most natural thing in the world to remember, but I forgot."  <br>You know how? I know it's because of the veil. It's very thick. And the more we focus on the physical content and especially our labels of the physical content, the deeper the physical experience becomes. You know, it's not that the physical experience is bad. It's just thick and rigorous, and it's consistent. It gives us an opportunity to be challenged and to make the two-wheeled intent to make choices that are either love-based or fear-based.  <br><br><br>So, I think that's about—that's about a summary. There's some other smaller things, but I think that really the messages of it—and there are other aspects, other places that sometimes will come to me, and I try to go there, and I just sense, "No, you don't need to go there," because there's something of an entertainment aspect that I think is not necessary.  <br>Like, as entertaining to think, "Oh wow, you know, I lived these other lives." Like, I know for instance, one time after I was meditating, I just suddenly became spontaneously aware that I had lived hundreds of other lives. I just saw these spheres, and I knew they were me, and I had this deep, profound sense that the me that feels like me to me was those other people.  <br>It's not like I always thought, "If reincarnation is real, it must be some other people, and I'm them." No, it was me exactly. Hello, everybody experience. Yeah, it's definitely me. And so, it's like I remember just brief snippets. Like, I remember being a woman who gave birth, and it was terribly painful, and having trauma that was like a fear I experienced in this life.  <br>And having to give birth the second time and being terrified of having to give birth because of the pain of giving birth. And this was in a time when there was not—and I remember being in very simple surroundings. But anyway, so those things are entertaining, but they're not really pertinent. I mean, I'm not—why I'm here—we don't come here just for that. We come here to be human.  <br>So, I respect—I guess I'm just saying I respect the fact that I don't remember more. And when I am curious, I respect when my guides—who I might not commonly consciously remember—I know they're there. I can feel them. But when they kind of give me the gentle "No," I'm okay with that. Like, I'm totally okay with that.  <br><br><br>And I've had out-of-body experiences. That's the other thing. And I've had some very eye-opening out-of-body experiences, and they're very wonderful and just so full of joy and fun. They're not why I'm here either. We're here to use this experience fully for everything that it can be and not get distracted.  <br>And I should like to add another reason the veil is there. It helps us not get distracted.  <br>Mira: Right, right. And so, now that you had this experience in your 20s, and you dealt with the PTSD after it, and that brought about the spiritual awakening within you, and now you have the awareness of, "I actually have overcome this fear. I've worked through it. I can say that I'm on the other side of this river I've been crossing. I'm not all the way on the other side of it. I'm very—I've healed a great deal of it, and I have the sense that if I even if I were to be finished with this life right now, I've already accomplished a very important step."  <br>Christian: Mm-hmm. I just know that that's the thing. My ego would like this to be quick and easy and just get it done. You know, like, "Oh, I have a task. I have an affinity to have this task of overcoming this fear. Let's just finish that task." That's how the human mind thinks.  <br>But I've come to find that the soul works in its own time, and it's very important to let time do its work on us. And so, what I'm letting happen is I'm letting—I'm being fully human. That's the hardest thing. Before, I didn't even realize I had so much fear. But for the first 30 years of my life, I didn't even allow myself to be fully present for simple things. I was always resisting.  <br>And now, I am not doing that. I am here. I am present even with simple sensations. I'm a very sensitive person. I sense energy. I'm very sensitive to foods and medicines and environments. Ask my very patient wife. She's very patient with my sensitivities. But it's so—it's hard.  <br>And that sensitivity actually goes hand in hand with the awareness that I asked to have because I knew it would mean I'd have to be more sensitive. And that sensitivity is an opportunity, even though it's hard sometimes. I'm committing day to day—just day to day—to be fully present with whatever I'm feeling and whenever I'm seeing and whomever I am.  <br>And I am no longer ashamed. I'm no longer afraid to be somebody or to fail in some way. I'm not afraid to feel pain. I've felt a lot of pain in this life and actually come close to death a few times—at least twice in my life. But I work to allow that.  <br>And as you do that, it's funny because we resist our suffering so much, but ironically, the way past the suffering is often through the suffering—not around it, not solving it. You can't have the—I don't mean to overgeneralize, but you can't have the intention to solve the suffering from outside of it.  <br>You need to realize that the universe is built from a place of love. It's here for a purpose of love. It's here from a purpose of love and built from wisdom. So, we can let—we can work with it. We can work with that human experience as it comes to us, even in the small ways. And there's so much power available there.  <br>And people don't realize how powerful they are day to day. It's a hopeful message. And actually, it's so perfect for what I would love to have you say to us. If there is a message you want to give to people, if there's something you want to bring from this story that everybody—each and every one of us—applies in that our lives will not be—  <br>Christian: I think the most important message is that you—whoever you are listening today—are loved. You are deeply, deeply loved. You are so loved. And if you could feel even a tiny bit of it, you would be brought to your knees and cry for joy. You are loved.  <br>So many of us don't even dare to believe that we're worthy of it, let alone think it's a real thing. I mean, here on Earth, we have some very harsh experiences that can happen here, and I understand that that's very hard and rigorous many times. But the love is always there, even when those experiences are happening. It's like—greater on the other side. It's closer to us than our own breath.  <br>I guess that's the most important thing I could possibly say is: You are loved. You are loved. You are loved. You are an immortal spirit. You're not going to die. There's no such thing as death. There is only the experience of being human. And whoever you are here listening today, you are you. You're not a human. You're you. And the you is having the experience of being a human.  <br>Mira: How would you suggest we deal with this forgetfulness and with this veil? Because you have the ability to remember, but most of us don't, and we're looking for that sense of remembering so we feel that love—that connection with all that is. How do you suggest we deal with it?  <br>Christian: I think it's so important that we surrender to the present moment because the present moment is not our enemy. And the veil, even though it is obscured so much, is not our enemy either. Our goal is not to find our way out. You know, there's so many people just want to get out.  <br>I'm here to tell you, having the opportunity to be human is an absolutely precious, amazing opportunity and a gift. It's like being handed the most precious gift in the universe, and here you are. So, all you have to do is meet this moment open with openness. You don't have to solve a huge crisis. You don't have to accomplish some activity. You just need to choose in your own heart, feel who you are, and be here in this moment.  <br>The power is now. It's not anywhere else. It's always right here, right now. In the veil, I keep saying it's thick, but it's actually thin. There is no—this gets into some other ideas, but there's no physical universe, actually. What there is is the experience of a physical universe. There's you—your consciousness—and it's having an experience of context.  <br>And the veil simply allows you to focus on that experience. But if you stop focusing on it—if you stop focusing on the sense data, the sight, sound, smell, the touch, the thoughts—if you step back from all that, you very naturally will find that you are already on the other side of the veil.  <br>It's not like you're completely stuck here. There's just a portion of you that is completely focused here, and because of the veil, you can't seem to find your way out. But the big you—the true you, your higher self—is always everywhere. It's always on the other side of the veil, and you're already connected to those systems.  <br>That's why out-of-body experiences can happen, and other—you know, we can go to other environments. I mean, I've had a few experiences where I've seen environments out-of-body that are so beautiful. They're there. The colors are alive and rich, and you could spend all day looking at the grass—you know, if it's a reality system with grass because we like grass.  <br>But you know, how can I go there when I'm here? Well, I am only partially here. And I just happen to have some awareness of that. I mean, I'm actually very thankful that I don't have more memory. I have thanked my guides that the veil remains over me to the extent that it does because, like I said, it's painful having some knowledge.  <br>But I feel like the people—when I walk down the street and I see other people, I feel love for them. And I feel that these other people are my brothers and sisters who just are convinced—yeah, that's okay. There's nothing wrong with that. The veil's here for a reason. I mean, this whole thing is here for a reason. It's not like this is a big mistake.  <br><br><br>Mira: What you're saying is truly extraordinary, and I know that we can keep on talking about so much more. I would love for us to keep talking, but for now, I would love to hear how people can connect with you and learn more from you because I know you teach so much.  <br>Christian: Sure. Yeah, I have a blog website called "A Walk in the Physical" at awalkinthephysical.com. You can reach me through there, or you can find me on Facebook. I'm happy to speak to anybody that I can. I feel it's important to remind each other of who we are, and that's why I'm so complimentary of your work.  <br>I loved seeing you being on stage with Wayne Dyer. That was so cool, and I know beautiful that you had the opportunity to be there for him in his life and the way that you were. That is a wonderful thing. And you know, I know you've touched many other people as well. So, thank you for doing your part.  <br>And whoever's listening today, I—you know, I may not know you personally, but I'm here to tell you, you are a brave and awesome spirit for doing this. And your journey today—whatever your human journey is—is meaningful and wonderful. And you are a superhero for being here on Earth today, and I'm proud to remind you of that, whoever you are.  <br>Mira: Oh, this was such an amazing ending. And as a different kind of veil descends upon me, yes, I want to thank you for this conversation. I want to tell you how much it has impacted me, and I know it has impacted everyone. And I'm so grateful for your time. I'm so grateful for your generous sharing.  <br>Thank you for reminding us. Thank you for inspiring us to keep going strong. And thank you for allowing us to feel grateful because, for me, you know, everything you shared allows me to feel even more grateful for every moment.  <br>Christian: Thank you, Mira.  <br>Mira: Bye for now, Christian. Have a good evening.  <br>Christian: Thank you very much.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2019/the-most-extraordinary-before-life-and-past-life-memory-story-you-have-ever-seen.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2019/The Most Extraordinary Before Life and Past Life Memory Story You Have Ever Seen.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:01:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Astounding Story of Life Between Lives]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=7VIhN6M81T4  <br>10 OCT 2020 <br><br><br>Hello, welcome, you guys! Everybody's joining. Hello, hello, welcome! Got a few more coming in.  <br>Hi there! Hey Shelly, hey Bettina. Shelley, we miss you. You need to move back. I don't like you living so far away. I'm not a fan. Michael and Sandy, great to see you guys. Wendy, hello with your groovy background. And there's Lourdes. Hello, everybody's coming in.  <br>We are going to have such a fun time tonight. I'm really looking forward to this. Let's just make sure everybody can join. Here comes Edie. Hello, Edie. There, I just admit, admit. There we go. We're going to have a pretty big group tonight, so I want to make sure everybody has a chance to join in.  <br>Let's see here. There's Peter. Hey, Peter, good to see you. And Carla. Hey, Amy, how are you? Do you know I think about your dream all the time, Amy? That's been like one of my little data points. It's like right in there. And Donna. Hello, Bruce. Hi, how are you? Hey, Edie. And Bettina, Mary, Jennifer, Vicki. Hello, Susan.  <br>All right, everybody's coming in. Jamie, I know there's a lot of people who are going to be watching this on the replay as well because our timing is a little late for some. So for those of you who are catching this on the replay, we welcome you as well. I'm going to be monitoring the chat tonight, so as we go, if you guys have questions for Christian, just let me know, and I will let him know.  <br>Let me just make sure we have everybody grouped here together. All right, so I believe all of you know about Wisdom Soup, but just in case you are less familiar with Wisdom Soup, we are a spiritual community that has been meeting now for over three years. We started here in the Seattle area back when meetups were held in person, and then we started remote broadcasting the meetings, and that grew to a wider group. Now we're online, so we literally are all over the world, which is super fun.  <br>As you guys know who are part of this group, we're a group of friends. Pretty much everybody that's drawn to this group, we're just a bunch of super, super "woo" light workers, and we go full "woo" with our topics. We talk about everything from dream interpretation to past life regression to every type of anything in between, dowsing. It really is like whatever sounds interesting and fun, that's what we talk about.  <br>It's about that we always are continuously learning. One of the best things we can do is we are all learners, we are all teachers, so we have so much to learn from being with each other, right? From each other and from our experience. So anyway, that's what I find. This process and being part of this group has been a big part of my own spiritual growth. It's been super important, not only in terms of just the subjects that we cover but also in community.  <br>You know, we all know that as you raise your vibration, you fall out of resonance with maybe the friends that you grew up with or the people that have been in your life previously, and we need our community. We need our people, and that's why we have groups like Wisdom Soup.  <br>We do meet every month, the second Thursday of every month, but for next month, we are going to meet two days early because many of you guys know I have channeled some information about events that may unfold on 11/11. If you don't know about that, please go to my YouTube channel. I'm not going to go into that because that's a whole subject I'm not going to go into tonight, but that's on my YouTube channel, which you can search my name and Tucker on YouTube and hear all of the channelings on that event and what's coming.  <br>But we may not be able to have our usual timing of that next month's meetup. It might be an unfortunate timing, so we're going to move it up a couple of days. I'll make sure I post that a few days early so that we all have a chance to join in and get together again.  <br>All right, so for tonight, we have a speaker I'm very, very excited about, Christian Sundberg. He has a very modest himself, and he thinks that what he knows is not that interesting, and I think it's incredibly fascinating, and I think you guys will agree with me and not with him.  <br>He is one of the few people that I've ever met who has an incredibly clear memory of experiences that he had on the other side. I'm super excited for him to share those memories and stories with us tonight. There's still a few more people joining us, but let me go ahead and get you any.  <br><br><br>Christian, you are already all set. Your video is on, so Christian, I'd like to introduce you. If you would introduce yourself.  <br>Christian: Sure. Before I introduce myself and get started, I'd like to be really cool with this group with all the energy I feel here. If we could just take 30 seconds to do a very, very brief meditation with each other and just set our intention together as a group because there's, like you said, a lot of light workers here. Oh, my goodness. The connectedness, the connection of this group is very powerful. So if we could just take 30 seconds, I think that would be really, really cool.  <br>This is an amazing group. So yeah, I'll introduce myself briefly. On the human side of things, I've worked for 15 years in the nuclear industry, managing projects of nuclear valve and pump manufacturing projects. I don't totally identify with my human work, but I guess that's how we're supposed to introduce ourselves in our society.  <br>I think it's more important to speak to who we really are, which is something far greater than the human. So in my case, I live in Pennsylvania. I lived in China for a while. Just kind of a normal guy. But recently, in the last couple of years, I felt called to share some pre-birth memory that had returned to me in my early 30s. I'm 40 now.  <br>When I was a young child, before the age of five or six, I had clear memory of my time before I was physical, before I was this human character, and I thought everybody did, and nobody talked about it, so I didn't talk about it. But I used to draw upon that memory very commonly as a small child.  <br>I kind of cheated a little bit because I had kind of seen ahead of time what my life would be like, so I was kind of always peeking around the curtain to get an idea of what to expect. But that memory left me at about the age of six or so, six or seven for sure. So I had no memory of that at all for most of my adult life.  <br>I just grew up with kind of a standard environment, and I learned what I was taught and all the rest of that. Then in my 20s, I went through a traumatic experience, which I had signed up for before I had come. So I went through that experience, and I did a lot of healing from that traumatic experience.  <br>Then at the age of 30, I began a long-term meditation practice, and much to my surprise, I began to have non-physical experiences, out-of-body experiences, and I also began to have this memory returned to me of choosing to come and my time immediately preceding this life.  <br>When those memories returned, it was like, "Oh, my gosh, like this is the most natural thing in the world. How did I ever forget this? It's like right there." But I'd forgotten because I'd been so physically focused, so tied into all the labels and all the identity and all the rest.  <br>So I felt actually for some number of years that I shouldn't speak about it. I felt like the timing just was not right. But a couple of years ago, I felt okay, the time is right. There's enough people ready now that we can talk about this.  <br>So I did share. I shared with Mira Kelly, who is a wonderful woman, and I shared in a couple of other places, and it's gone an amazing response. I've met amazing people like almost every day. I'm meeting new people, and it's just been an amazing process.  <br>So I'll share, and please, anybody, please do interrupt. Any thoughts or questions or ideas, this conversation is fluid. Everyone here is a master in their own right, so we're all in dialogue with one another. So I'm just going to recount my experience, and then anybody who wishes to interject, please do so.  <br><br><br>Okay, so before I start, I just got to say that this kind of stuff is like impossible to talk about. Who we truly are is beyond form. You know, we are non-physical beings. We are consciousness itself, non-physical, and within the non-physical arises the world of form, arises things, objects, experiences, and words.  <br>Words then can't speak to that higher nature because they are formed themselves. They're symbols. There's no words I can just say that could possibly even remotely touch the other side or these experiences. I just have to make that really big disclaimer to start.  <br>Okay, so that being said, I remember a very long time ago. Again, these experiences all have a sequence, but they also are kind of happening all at once. Even now, I feel like these memories are happening now. They're not so much in the past, and yet they're simultaneously now. I don't know how to describe that.  <br>So my earliest memory is before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical, a very powerful, beautiful being, and I was completely overwhelmed by the quality of his nature, by who he was. He was just so beautiful and full of joy and power, so much potential and amazingness.  <br>I was amazed by the quality of his nature, his essence, and I asked him, and again, this is telepathic because there's something on the other side. "Oh, my goodness, how did you do this? Look at what you are." And he shared with me that he had been physical, and he shared with me specifically one life that he had where he had suffered with a very difficult physical ailment.  <br>I don't know what it was, but some kind of pain or long-term suffering, and the way that he met that experience was incredibly powerful. He expanded in an incredible way because of this experience.  <br>I asked him, "Were you healed all the way?" Like, as I saw how damaged he had been, and he shared with me, "Yes." And I kind of sensed the depth of like this damage of being physical that he'd experienced and how he'd healed all of it and this amazing expansion that had taken place within him.  <br>And I said, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I'm going to do that." I was so fired up. I was totally committed, and he didn't quite brush me off, but it was a little bit of like, "Yeah, that's what they all say."  <br>And I was like, "No, I'm serious. I want to do that. I want to go do that. I want to have that experience. I want to be physical." And he said, "Go talk to your guides." So I did.  <br>And that was a long time ago because since then, I had many physical lives, and I went back and found him later and showed him, not to show him, but how to converse with him and kind of share with him, "Okay, see, I'm on the path. I said I was going to do this, and here I'm doing this."  <br><br><br>Okay, so now I'm going to jump a bit because there's a lot. Okay, so now I'm going to jump to a bit that's somewhat immediately preceding this life where I had taken a long break. I had lived many experiences, and I took a long break. I just decided I was gone for a while. I was not doing a physical thing for a while.  <br>I was taking a long break, and I remember this guy coming to me repeatedly over and over, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" Basically, reminding me of my own intention and just trying to nudge me back onto the path.  <br>And I put him off for a while, and eventually, I said, "Okay, I'm ready to go back." And I remember reviewing with him the state of who I was, like what I had done, what I had been, and like all these things.  <br>This is really hard. It's really hard to describe. All the stuff's like impossible to describe, but the qualities of what I had been and who I was, and the thing that I needed to work on was obvious. The thing that I, I hate to put it that way, it's not to work on, but I can tell that I had a like it was just very obvious.  <br>If you look at like a report or something, the one thing I really needed to work on, it was glaring. I was like, "Oh, yeah, I really need to do that." And it involved a fear that I had experienced in one specific life.  <br><br><br>In that life, the fear was so profound and so powerful that it drove me to be a very nasty person. I was a very non-helpful person. I damaged many other people. I mean, you can't truly damage the soul, but in that life, I had caused a lot of damage because of this fear.  <br>And I ended up dying in a very painful, agonizing way. So I was surprised at how incredibly deep that fear had been for me, how deep that fear was in me.  <br>So I wanted to re-engage that fear, and as I reviewed this, I knew the incredible amount of expansion that would be possible if I could do this, if I could meet this fear and integrate this certain energy to this degree. I just knew it would be unspeakably beautiful and powerful if I could do that.  <br>But even then, I could see the vibrational distance was so extreme that I remember asking the guy, "Is it even possible? Has anyone, has any other being in creation ever done this? Has any other being ever done something this extreme in this kind of way?"  <br>And he said, "Yes." And it was like this encouraging, "And you have all time to do so. There's no hurry." So I knew, and this sounds kind of as a human that sounds kind of alien to me, but at the time, I just knew with complete confidence, "If it can be done, I will do it. If it can be done, I will do it."  <br><br><br>I knew that I had that ability. So with that being said, they brought me a life that was really perfect for this intention of mine. So I reviewed this life, and it was perfect. It was like almost as good as they get.  <br>And I accepted the life, and I accepted the veil. Okay, so the veil of forgetfulness, this process of incarnating, is what I remember the most out of all this. And that process is very abrupt and shocking.  <br>So in this life, I accepted the veil. The veil came over me, and then I was in the womb. But okay, so when the veil came over me, I felt my knowing be cut off. I felt my vibration plummet from great heights down to the low, low, lower and lower and go lower still, and then lower, lower, and then you finally get there.  <br>And when you're there, it's so low, it's ridiculous, and you're cut off. I mean, at least for me, I felt cut off, and I felt like I didn't have that connectedness with other people or any other beings anymore. I didn't have my knowing anymore, and it was terrifying.  <br>And I wasn't even born yet. I was just in the womb, and I was terrified. And I was only there for a very, very short time, and I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this. This is not happening. This is so ridiculous. This is so low vibration. This is so dark. I am not doing this."  <br><br><br>And I summoned my might, and I smote the veil. I fought my way out, and I succeeded in doing that. But I had killed the fetus. I had killed the body that was to be mine, and I feel responsible for that. I feel sadness because when I got to the other side, I had a life review even for that very short life.  <br>I reviewed, and I remember seeing the mother and all the hundreds of other people that would be negatively impacted. I could feel how I negatively impacted the mother. I heaped more difficulty on her through the sorrow of her loss, and also hundreds of other people whose lives would be made more difficult because I had made the mother's life more difficult.  <br>And I couldn't believe it. I was like, "Well, I mean, it's really hard to describe, but I went in with great intentions. I had all these good intentions. I had this big plan, and then I just, and then my fear was so great that right at the beginning, I caused that."  <br>And I not only did not succeed in my intention, but I caused the game to be more difficult for the players that I so loved and respected. That was how I, I mean, I'm using metaphors now. It's not quite like that, but so I was disappointed.  <br>I mean, I knew everything was okay. Everything's on the other side. You know, everything is well. It's okay, but I was disappointed that I had let that happen.  <br><br><br>So I decided before I attempted this again because I knew I would want to try again. Before I did that, I practiced accepting the veil because I didn't want to have that same thing happen again.  <br>So I remember going to this place that can only be described as like a veil acceptance simulator room. It was like a place you go where they practice surrendering to the veil and having your knowing cut off and feeling separate and dark and alone.  <br>And it's kind of like diving into a pool and then seeing how long you can stay underwater, and then you can jump back out if you get too scared, but you practice.  <br>And I remember practicing, and basically, it had to do with my willingness to feel the fear and my willingness to allow and not resist. So after doing that, they brought me this life, and this life was not as optimal as the first one would have been.  <br>It was still good. It was quite good, but each life is only so good because the soul, the spirit, is rather complex. And what makes it up, in my case, I just knew I had many qualities and a certain type of my nature, and that nature has to interface with the life somehow, and then that has to work within the context of what you're trying to do, what you want to do.  <br>And this life was pretty good. It wasn't perfect, but it was good. So I remember reviewing this life in great detail and reviewing what I can only describe as a vast flowchart or like a tree of all the things that might or could or would happen in this life.  <br>And there were, it started like kind of like if you imagine a tree tipped on its side, like a thicker trunk, and then it went out to branches, and there's all these paths. Some paths were very likely, some paths were a lot less likely, but it wasn't about events.  <br>Well, I mean, there were definitely events in it, but it wasn't so much about events as how it would feel, how it would be to be that person in these different possible avenues of how this life might unfold.  <br>And I went through millions of possibilities all within the blink of an eye. It was easy to do that. I remember reviewing just tons of huge amounts of information all at once.  <br>And I knew even then that it was very likely that I would experience a trauma in my 20s that would crush me and that would help facilitate my opportunity to re-experience this fear that I wanted to re-experience and integrate.  <br>So I was super excited to do this, to accept this, even though I knew it would be hard. And I knew that the body, this body, had certain limitations that other bodies do not, and that this body would be difficult in certain ways on a day-to-day level that would challenge my ego or something.  <br>It would make it difficult for me in a way that I would be forced to turn inward, and I would have to find strength. And also, I wouldn't be able to go totally down the ego path because it would be too challenging.  <br>So anyway, I reviewed all this, and I remember there having to be a moment to accept, and I don't remember that moment, but I do remember after that waiting for this to start the life.  <br>And I was in a state where I was still timeless, and it was wonderful. And I remember this light, this powerful light, and then I remember the guy coming to me and being like, "All of a sudden," and not rude, but almost rude, like, "Now, go. Now, you have to go now. Right now."  <br>Getting my attention like, "Super, like now, buddy." So I was like, "Okay, now." So then, alright, the next thing is I was at these beings that I can only describe as tinkerers or technicians. These beings who are like technical in nature, and they helped apply the veil to me.  <br>So they do this. I don't know how to describe it. There's this thing like the spirit has certain nature and qualities, and the life is certainly something going on in the body, and they have to do this thing where it like, I don't know, they make everything fit somehow.  <br>So they were doing that, and they asked me one more time, "Are you sure?" And I knew that this was the point of no return. If I said yes here, I was in for the ride. I was strapped in.  <br>And I remember saying, "Yes," and then the veil coming over me again. Okay, so this time, my intention was, "Okay, just don't fight it. Just let go. Don't resist. Just allow."  <br>And I remember, okay, so like this drop in vibration is meaningful to explain, but if you imagine like an amp that produces a pitch, and then you have a vowel, and you turn it down, when it turns down, well, I turn all the way down, and then turn down more and more and more and more and more and keep cranking down.  <br>That's how it felt in the vibration of the being coming down into this super dense, super tight, super cut-off, like going to the vacuum of space. I think is a good metaphor. I like to use it. It's like you go to a place where there's just no heat and no air. There's just empty space.  <br>That's how it felt, but also super dense, like coming down and being shoved into a tuna can, like a fish can. And it was incredibly jarring, but I just strove not to fight it.  <br><br><br>Okay, so one of the things I had asked before in the review process was I had asked to have a small amount of memory this time. I said, "I don't want to forget everything. I want to have just a tiny, tiny little amount of memory, just a tiny little bit."  <br>And they said I could do that. They had said that I could do that, but it would make it more challenging. It would make this life more difficult because the contrast would be even greater.  <br>And at the time, I knew that even that contrast was like all contrast, an opportunity for growth. So I accepted. So anyway, as the veil came over me now, I was feeling this, and there was like this little window open that I surmised.  <br>I don't know for certain, but I think it had to do with that request because I had this little window open that was not available all the way, and I remember holding on for a super long time and being like, "Oh, my gosh, this is crazy," and sending a signal back through the window.  <br>Did it take back to the technicians? And then sending one signal back, "Yes." So I knew that the veil had been successfully applied, and I allowed myself to be in the womb in peace for a while.  <br>So then I was there for a while, okay, and it was all good. And then eventually, I said, "I'm not doing this. This is like the darkness and the cutoffness and the lack of connectedness." And I was like, "Stuff, I'm not doing this again."  <br>So again, I reached this point where I'm like, "This is ridiculous. This is just so ridiculous." So at that moment, I began to summon my energy again so that I could fight my way out again.  <br>But as that happened, I had this very humbling moment, and it's like the most holy, precious memory for me. I remember the spirit of God coming to me and showing me that I was still all that is.  <br>It showed me the stars and the solar system, and I remember feeling the churning of the sun, the joy of that, and knowing that was still me. And the spirit said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this."  <br>Most only thing for me to remember because that's what we really are. That's what all of us really are. And it's very hard to remember that now because I feel deep in the human experience right now. I'm not close to there right now. I'm deep in the weeds.  <br>But at the time, it called me a lot, and it made me relax, and I was like, "Oh, good. Oh, that's good. I'm still that. That's good." So then I relaxed, and as I did that, I just was able to let go and experience the simple, relatively simple experience of being in the womb.  <br><br><br>Okay, so then the next memory is the day I was born. I remember the day I was born. I remember just one visual image of the room after I was out, and I remember seeing the layout of the room.  <br>And then when I was older, I drew the room from my mother, and I said, "You were here. The bed was here. Here was the window. Here was the heating grate. Here was the doctor." And she said I was right, which I knew I would be.  <br>But beside the visual memory, that wasn't the most important memory. The most important memory was just like the experience, the shock. There was no context yet. I was just, I had no intellectual context whatsoever. I was like a clean slate.  <br>So it was just sense data and stuff going on. There was cold and shock and light and touching and very intense sense data. And I remember being intensely curious and looking around and being like, "What is this place? Where am I?"  <br>And looking at these beings who are taking care of me or doing whatever they're doing and being in awe of them and actually feeling love for them. And actually, it's funny because just last week, I was talking to my father about this memory, and he said, "That's interesting."  <br>He said, "Because the day you were born, your eyes were wide open, and you were looking at everything with such an intense curiosity." And he said he couldn't believe that such a young baby could have such an intense curiosity.  <br>And I remember that. I remember being like, "What is this?" So after that, I don't have any memory for years after that first day. I mean, I have some very vague memories of looking up at my crib, looking up at the dangly thing that's supposed to get my attention, and being happy when my mother came to get me.  <br>Some brief memories like that, but when I got older, when I was like two or three, I just assumed everybody knew that we weren't really from here. This was just a neat experience, any place we came to have an experience.  <br><br><br>And I assumed that many things and the other realities would be true here. And the example I mentioned in the other video was I remember assuming that we could feel each other's emotions here because in other reality systems, you just share feelings and information, and it's all telepathic, and it's just an open channel.  <br>So I remember being in a diaper one day, and my parents had a friend over who was a neighbor, and I remember that my father had a record on the record player, and he was playing a song I really liked, and I remember dancing to the song and feeling really funky and shaking my little push in my diaper and saying to the neighbor, "Watch me dance," because I wanted her to feel what I was feeling.  <br>And she walked away unimpressed, and I remember this like dawning on me like, "She can't feel what I'm feeling. Like, what is going on? Like, what is this place where we can't feel each other's emotions? Like, what the heck is going on?"  <br>It was just so foreign, and I had other assumptions that I thought would be true here. And even to this day, I feel like there's certain things about this world that I just don't get. Like, it's just not normal. Certain things that happen here are just not where we're typically used to being.  <br><br><br>Another example I like to use is I assumed that people who were in positions of authority or power were loving and wise beings because in other reality systems, the powerful beings who are in roles of authority or helpfulness, they're loving and wise.  <br>So I assumed that to be true here. Like, if you were teaching a classroom, you must be a loving and wise being. And if you were the mayor of the city, you must be even more loving and wise. If you're the president of the United States, you must be the most loving and wise person.  <br>Well, that's not how it works on Earth. It's just not how it happens. So eventually, like I said, the memories passed, and I had no memory of that at all until I was 30, and then this began to return to me.  <br><br><br>And as it did, there's been moments of curiosity where I'll go to a memory and be like, "Oh, what else?" And I just get this nudge like, "No, you don't need to know anything else."  <br>And there's a reason that the veil is because the veil, I'm so thankful that I'm veiled because even having a tiny glimmer is just, it can be very painful. So that's a summary.  <br>It's really, again, it's really hard to talk about these things because they're way bigger than anything words can say. And we like to think of things from the human perspective, so we like to think in terms of objects and events and places and what did that look like and where did you go and yeah.  <br>But the whole physical universe that we're in right here is something of a virtual reality. It's something of a, it's occurring within our consciousness itself that pre-existed and will exist after the constraints of this physical experience are done.  <br>So those reality systems and those experiences are just so transcendent by comparison next to what we can possibly say here.  <br><br><br>I went for a long time, no, it's amazing. I didn't want to interrupt you because, to me, it's like this story is just so incredible. So what? It's actually not incredible because I just have to say that because every person here, yes, has done that and more. But that's the part. Nothing unique.  <br>There's nothing at all unique about me at all. I think that's what someone feels like. It's like, "Oh, that's so interesting." No, it's not. It's very normal, actually. Everything I'm just describing is very normal. We are non-physical beings having a human experience. This is what we are.  <br>And we have all gone through incredible journeys, but I think that's what's amazing. Okay, sorry about it. Yeah, it's to think that we've all done that, like to have you explain it, and for all of us to understand as you're talking about this experience, for each of us to know that we've done that and that we're doing something similar.  <br>I can't speak for you, of course, but you've done very likely that. Everyone has had, I mean, I feel like it's very likely that everybody's had a similar process. I can only speak for myself, but yes, all of us. We all come intentionally.  <br><br><br>There's a really important point. There's no such thing as an incarnation without free will agreement, right? There's always agreement. So all of us agreed, even though we don't remember, and everything we've ever failed, and Earth is super, super dense.  <br>You know, we did agree to come here. Yeah, and I've heard, and I think many of us have heard the description before of what it is to be born and to accept the veil, but I've never heard it in a first-person account before. I've never heard someone so that's what makes it feel so real. It's visceral.  <br>That is so exciting that it's not just theory. You know, I hear theory. I hear the description from, and this is like, you know, you talking about, "I went down to the 7-11 and bought a soda," and yeah, and I accepted the veil, which is like, it's like it's real.  <br>It is real, and it's interesting because I think a lot of, so in spirituality, in general, you know, I think we tend to kind of think about it a little bit like we put it in this conceptual bucket, and it's over there somewhere. You know, it's like this abstract thing.  <br>Well, okay, we're spirits, but we're really on Earth. I really see what's in front of me. Okay, but there's some, you know, there's angels, and there's other reality. No, it's real. Yeah, and actually, this place, this experience, is the less real experience.  <br>And we all kind of know that. You know, we all kind of sense this is not quite all that's going on. This is like the dream. This is what I like to call it, like a black-and-white movie. It's real, but it's not fundamentally real.  <br>It's not the most real, and where we come from and who we really are is what is far more real, and it's very normal. Yeah, it's not like, you know, woo-woo fairy tale, like, "Oh, that's weird religious stuff." No, no.  <br>We are more than human. It's just that here on Earth, it's very normal to be very heavily veiled, especially because of just the way that we've, the nature of this reality, and what we've done with it, and the way that we play with this dense form.  <br>It's just the way that it works that we feel completely immersed in it, but yeah, that's not really what we are.  <br><br><br>One question that came in was from Wendy. She was asking about, so when you took on this life, the fact that there was, you said, some ego challenge. Was that complementary to your purpose, or was that part of your purpose?  <br>I think it was complementary, and I think it was both because it complemented the growth, but it was also very much important that I do that because if I wasn't challenged in that way, I don't think I would have the ability to meet the big kahuna fear when it arrived.  <br>Like, I needed to have a day-to-day challenge to be able to be in a place where I can meet the fear. And like another thing, I know that had to happen is I knew that my father was important because I knew that my father would instill a confidence in me.  <br>He would build up my confidence a lot as a child, and that confidence would be really important for me to have a rock to stand on to face this fear. And he did that. I also knew that it was important that I be male and not that male.  <br>So I had some people make comments after that. I mentioned this in the other video, and they said, "What about how females can excel?" Of course, that's not what I'm saying. It's just that the female and the male energy are just different, and there's a certain kind of an edge that I needed to call, even an obtuse edge or something.  <br>I just needed a certain edge to be able to meet the fear in the way that I needed to meet it. And nothing that's nothing to do with male or men or women being better or worse or anything like that. I just knew that it was important that I'd be male.  <br>Anyway, those were just other examples of things that were important for me to be able to meet fear.  <br><br><br>Yeah, a couple of questions came through. Donna is asking, "Why is it necessary that we hide from our true selves?"  <br>Okay, so if you weren't veiled, you would be the unveiled you, and the unveiled you is connected to all that is and is unlimited and is full of power and connectedness, and there is no duality to strive against in that because that's you.  <br>You are transcendent of that. So to put it in a mundane way, so like, if you knew that you were the sun—I like to use the sun because that's what I experienced in my womb experience—but if you knew that you were connected to the sun like tangibly, not just as an intellectual idea, but you could feel the sun in your being, and you could feel its bliss, and you knew that you were the stars, and you knew that nothing could, you know, get up in the morning and eat your cereal and drive to work?  <br>No, you wouldn't because you'd be the sun. You wouldn't be you. So if you want to be you, if you want to be the separate you, then it's actually a huge opportunity to be veiled because it means that now there's this unique perspective from which you can integrate from, and that perspective is an incredible opportunity for expansion.  <br>Which there's a, okay, this is an important idea. So, and again, I'm drawing a line because in duality, but because we're in duality right now, but this is beyond duality. So you've got source, okay?  <br>So if you imagine that is like a sun or something, a source of light, if you can go like this far away from source or this far or this far vibrationally, and then you can integrate that experience and be fully there, then there's this expansion that takes place.  <br>This is so beyond words. That's very, very, very powerful, and that's only possible if you are the human immersed all the way in the human character. It's exactly that immersion. It's exactly that consistency and the denseness of the experience that gives it the edge that permits the expansion that we are looking to.  <br>So is it defining our finding our way back to source from so far a distance is what causes the expansion of spirit? I think that's a natural thing. I think that's going to happen naturally as one does that.  <br>It's not that the goal is simply to find one's way back to source because you're already source. You're already the drop in the ocean is still the ocean. You are still the ocean right now. You're not actually separate.  <br>This is a really important point. None of us are actually separate from each other. We are not separate from God or source, whatever we want to use. We're not. Okay, so but though, if we come into this defined experience and we want to integrate this experience, and integrate means we fully experience it, we bring love to it, we bring openness to it, we learn how to be our true loving joyful selves in that experience, whatever it is.  <br>As we do that, the expansion naturally happens, and we naturally end up returning because we were already there in the first place. I don't know how else to put it.  <br><br><br>A question is, one person was wondering if you wouldn't mind sharing what the fear was that you needed to overcome, if you're okay if that's, you know, if it's universal.  <br>Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Well, I'm still in the process of integrating this fear. It's too big to do all at once, but I've taken very important steps in this life to do that.  <br>So when we talk about fears and from the human perspective, we like to say a fear of something, you know, like a fear of spiders or something. It's bigger than that. It's like a vibration. It's a state of being in which one is distant from source in a certain vibrational way.  <br>And the way that I could best describe that would be, and this has to do with the negative self-perception, okay? Because fears ultimately arise from a negative either a negative self-perception or a perception that's negative about the world.  <br>So there's always some, we fear is always because we bought into some perception that is not in alignment with the truth. So the truth is we are powerful. When we buy into the perception of powerlessness, we feel fear.  <br>The truth is we are loved. We buy into the idea that we are not loved, we feel fear. Anyway, in my case, this specific fear was a fear of inability to escape agony mixed with being too proud to suffer.  <br>So, reject, so being stuck in pain and being too proud to, like, kind of like stuck in pain and not resisting it. So because that was the fear, I have had some very interestingly painful experiences in this life, which is okay.  <br>It's okay because ultimately, there's no experience that I choose to not reject. Any experience that's my goal because there is no need to reject any of the experiences. But in my case, I was in Chengdu, China, and I intended to live in China after I graduated from college.  <br>And in this case, physically, what happened was I had a heat stroke, and I was in a Chinese hospital for four days, and I was given a large amount of potassium—bag after bag after bag after bag of potassium.  <br>It caused some kind of neurological burn in my whole system that was absolutely agonizing, and I was stuck in that for weeks. I also, my body had a whole bunch of other problems, and it was just agony.  <br>And I suffered trauma from that. I was in a hotel room in China for a while. I had lived in China in Beijing in the year 2000. This is 2002 that this experience happened, and that experience went on for a while, and I was traumatized from it.  <br>I went through years of counseling to face the feelings and the fears and the sensations that I experienced in that moment. See, I'm a really sensitive person, and actually, that goes hand in hand with having some memory of pre-life because I knew that if I wanted to have some memory of pre-life, I'd have to be very sensitive.  <br>And so, the experience was even more intense. I experienced everything pretty intensely. So the moment that I rejected for many years was a moment I was laying in a hospital bed in China, and I felt like I was going to die, and there was no way to escape this pain.  <br>And that was it. It was very, very, very dark, a vibrational moment. So yeah, I don't, I no longer have trouble viewing it now. I have set an incredible amount of things into momentum in my own experience because we set momentum with our intention, with our beliefs.  <br>It creates momentum, and things arrive into our experience from that. And so, there are moments when I have, you know, some serious, you know, significant pain at times, but that's okay.  <br>I don't resist. I'm not, reality is not our enemy. So as things arrive to us, we can allow them and feel them and meet them with openness, and I'm striving to do that.  <br>I love that. I think that is a message I keep getting over and over again: to allow what comes, yeah, to see what arises and to accept it and to work with it.  <br><br><br>Another question that came in is, "Did we pre-choose our career path as well, or is it insignificant in this whole journey for our profession?"  <br>I don't know. Not sure. Okay, I can't say categorically. I can say in my case, I had no memory of, well, I just say pre-life. I had no memory of the job I would do, but as a child, I actually, interestingly, had an intuitive moment where I pictured this one room where I would have a business meeting.  <br>And then, like, I forgot about that, and a few years ago, I was in this room having this meeting, and I had this moment where I came back, and I'm like, "Holy crap, I saw this like 30 years ago."  <br>So, so this, but that's, see, the system, spirit is very good at predicting outcomes because it has all the data. But anyway, so I don't know. I don't know if, I think for some people, I imagine that in their pre-life plan, doing a certain physical work is going to be very important for them.  <br>I imagine that's definitely true for some people. I just know in my case, it didn't come up.  <br><br><br>Sheila was asking when you were talking about the first being who inspired you to come in the first place, that that person was so powerful and positive, and she's wondering what that was relative to. So she's curious about hierarchy on the other side and what does that look and feel like.  <br>Okay, so I won't try to speak to the hierarchy overall on the other side, but I will just say that love is that is the hierarchy. So in my, okay, so like, I think a metaphor would help.  <br>So if you had, like, let's say you took a beautiful maple leaf from a tree, and you put it next to a large flowering grapevine, which one is better? Well, they're just different. Sure, one is bigger and has more grapes, but this one's beautiful too.  <br>That's kind of like how spirit is. Each spirit is gorgeous and unique and meaningful. But in this case, in comparison to what I could do at the time, this being was incredibly powerful.  <br>Actually, that reminds me of an interesting quote from Bob Monroe. He's an out-of-body explorer. Many people here are probably familiar with Robert Monroe's books. He said something like, "Beings who graduated from the physical universe experience were like gods in other systems."  <br><br><br>Now, it's not that we come here to be powerful. It's that as we grow in joy and love and as we conquer fear, power is the natural result, especially in other systems that are much less constraining.  <br>This is the constraining, super crazy place. So if we can master things here, holy cow, we've got it made when it's a lot easier. It's like metaphorically, if you go and, I don't know, you go run a marathon, it's not hard for you to jog a quarter of a mile.  <br>It's not, you know, you've already run a marathon. Kind of like that.  <br>What is it to be powerful on the other side? Is it to be, what do you use that power for? What are you doing? So there are different reality systems, and there are different rules in them, and most, I don't know, I'm not like an avid out-of-body explorer.  <br>I don't have tons of experience, but the experience I've had and from my pre-birth memory, my understanding is that many other systems are thought-responsive, intent-responsive, and the nature of who we are immediately has an effect on the environment or on what we can do.  <br>So when consciousness evolves, its capabilities in those environments evolve. Now, that's like more of a tangible, you're asking power like, "What can it do?" You say, "What can it do?" So that's more like, to me, that means more like something tangible.  <br>So in a reality system, there's a way that spirit can better execute, better, I don't know, actualize, I guess, its nature when it has evolved. I'll put it that way. But power overall, the true power is love, beingness itself.  <br>That is the only power. So I can't really answer, "Oh, well, you can move some rocks." No, not about moving rocks. It's about being, beingness with a capital B, and as beingness expands, it's beautiful and powerful.  <br>Like, I mean, people who have had near-death experiences or spiritual transformative experiences, you experience interacting with source. They convey power but also amazing total love.  <br>That's the true power: the love of surrender and who we really are, beingness itself. That is the power. So when we can take that beingness and reflect it here in a circumstance, that's powerful.  <br>Let's say you've got an illness. Let's say you just heard you got a really terrible illness. How do you meet that moment? That's powerful. If you meet it with love and openness, that's power.  <br>Yeah, we like to take words like power and then define them. You know, we're like, "Oh, okay, I got these words. Okay, so what is this?" And we always want to know, "What is this thing? What is this?"  <br>It's bigger than that. Unfortunately, unfortunate to the thinking mind.  <br><br><br>So she was asking, she's wondering if we have color, like are different souls different colors? So like green rays or like this idea of the different rays. Do we perceive as color, or are we all white?  <br>She asks, "I've experienced color in out and on non-physical realities." I'll just say that, and I know that I've had experiences where I've engaged another being, and the quality of their nature is full of much, including color and vibration and sound.  <br>And again, we like to say, "What is that thing? You know, what is, what's the sight?" I know green. So is there green? Well, actually, green's kind of a good example because the one out-of-body experience I had, all I did was look at the grass.  <br>It was this reality system. It had grass, and the grass was the most beautiful grass I ever saw. It was vibrant, alive. The green was so green and so beautiful that I spent, I felt like I could look at the grass all day and be completely full of joy because the grass was so green.  <br>So there's color.  <br><br><br>What other reality systems do you remember? I'm not going to try to define that from here. I think I would be very incorrect to do that. Is there another one or one other that you can, I can, I'd probably try to categorize at least a couple.  <br>I've had out-of-body experiences that I would say are like very local, where I see this world. Like one time, I was walking down my steps. This is kind of a funny story, but I had, I was walking down my stairs, and I was out of body.  <br>So I gave myself permission to get up from bed, and I got up from bed, but I didn't actually get up from that. My body was still in bed. So I'm walking down the steps, and I'm like, "Am I out of body?"  <br>Just something just didn't, it wasn't quite right, but it was perfectly normal. Like, it's so normal. So I'm walking down the stairs, I'm feeling the carpet in between my toes, and I'm feeling the cracks in the wall, and I get to the bottom of the stairs, and I actually concluded I was not out of body because it was so normal.  <br>And I actually thought to myself, "I'm the only guy in my city walking down his stairs wondering if he's out of body." Like, I actually felt dumb because I'm always exploring. I'm always trying to ask the questions because you've got to like have that mindset if you're going to, so but then I got to the bottom of the stairs, and the light was just a little bit different, and I'm like, "Maybe I'm out of body."  <br>So how else can I test it? Because I could feel the wall. I could feel the carpet. So I decided to try to walk through the wall in the front of my house, and I did. I walked through it, and I was in the front yard, and I was like, "It's a good test. Oh, my gosh, I'm out of body."  <br>So that was one experience, but I think that's actually the only time I've had an experience where I was that local in my house kind of thing. But I've had other experiences that are in vibrant, like rich-colored, vibrant realities that are just alive with color and vibrancy.  <br>That's the only way I can put it. I've also had experiences where I've interacted with someone. I've had four times. I like to do this little experiment when I, if my body's asleep, and I have a non-physical experience with somebody, I like to try to prove it the next day, like a hobby.  <br>So if I meet the person, I usually try to get their attention in a way that I can confirm with them when we wake up. So and I've had four successes so far. I've probably had five or six failures, but I've had four successes, which is pretty cool.  <br>That is cool. That's very cool.  <br><br><br>Another question is wondering, someone's wondering about, as spirit, that we can travel through all the different dimensions. So she certainly is like, like seven through twelve, then ten through twenty-two.  <br>She recently learned that someone who had six near-death experiences that there are 22 dimensions, and after ten, it's like either we get to create galaxies and planets. Anyway, she's wondering what your impression is of all that.  <br>The answer is yes. I won't speak to the number of realities. I don't know. I don't know the number of dimensions, but I do know that consciousness itself is always connected to all other things, always.  <br>There is no separation, truly. The consciousness I'm talking about, your consciousness right now, the you that's listening, the aliveness that you feel in your body, the eye that eye is the movie screen that the physical universe is playing on.  <br>And you don't have to have a physical movie playing on it. This is just a metaphor. That consciousness that I, that's you right now, is the same eye that is connected to all things and can experience other reality systems.  <br>There's a good quote by the guide Seth. Seth Speaks. I love Seth. That's great. Says something like, "Reality, physical reality, is a bright point of light that you just never look away from, but you can."  <br>And I love that because it takes some getting used to because here in this reality, we get super deep, super dense, super focused, super labels, super physical, super worries, super pain, all the stuff.  <br>So it takes some serious practice usually to even achieve silence of thought. You need to be able to experience what you really are, which is awareness itself, without having thought constantly bombard you.  <br>And then once you are thought itself, or I mean, thought itself, beingness is self-awareness itself, you will find non-physical things will rise to you all on their own. Like, you don't go get it. At least, it's not how I experience it. They just come because they're in you already.  <br>Like, think of it this way. It's in you. It's not that you are stuck in this place and you've got to go somewhere else. Now, the physical location, discrete location, is an illusion.  <br>Like, right now, you're on the West Coast, right? I'm in the Eastern Time Zone. Well, not really. What's really happening is we're engaged in this mutual environment that we perceive as the physical world that has context, really good context.  <br>But ultimately, there is that's all. You're not really that face that I see on the screen. I'm not really this. We are already connected in the higher state right now. You don't have to. You're already on the other side of the veil right now.  <br><br><br>So when you were brought a life, what were you doing? You said they brought it to you, so presumably, you were in the midst of something else. What were you doing? Were you, oh, how were you?  <br>Yeah, I used the word frolicking in the last video because it like, I think that's a close English word. Like, I remember being in a realm of golden light and just, you know, prancing is the wrong word, but just like, just enjoying being and moving.  <br>And I remember engaging in some activities that we might call like communication, creative endeavors, visiting places, all very fast. But I won't try to go any more into that. I don't think because I think it's just not right for me to do that from here.  <br>Is it because yes, we want to know like, "Oh, what objects were there?" We're really curious about environments, you know, because we live in a physical environment, so we think reality is an environment.  <br>You know, we think we look around, we see this environment. All in reality, this is what reality is. So now I want to know what other, I'm not saying that environments aren't important. They are. They're really cool.  <br>I mean, we create environments in this reality and in others. It's just that we're bigger than just the objects or the places.  <br>Anyway, so that makes sense. I think it relates back to what you were saying about when they were trying to explain the life to you, they were focused more on how you would feel at different stages of the life versus the specifics of the reality.  <br>It's how it is to be it. What is it like? Like, right now, if you were going to have a conversation with a non-physical person, you know, would they be asking you like, "What did you do at work today?"  <br>No, it's, "Who are you? What is it to be you?" And then what you share is exactly what it's like to be you, exactly what you're feeling, exactly what your perspective is, exactly, you know, what I mean?  <br>Like, it's not about the things happen, the context happens, the actions happen, the job happens. That's okay, and that's a part of it. It's meaningful, but really, what you're experiencing is what it's like to have that experience.  <br>That's amazing. That's totally amazing.  <br><br><br>I've been told by the angels that one of the things that's coming on Earth after this awakening is that we will develop that same empathic telepathy here, and they said it will bring world peace.  <br>That people, that negotiations will go more smoothly because of the fact that people and people who don't necessarily understand what's happened to them, they won't know why it is, but they'll all of a sudden know that they can't, that all of a sudden, they understand each other's point of view, and that the negotiations will go more smoothly, and it'll lead to peace.  <br>It makes sense to me because it's what we naturally are, so it makes sense to me. I mean, I don't have any knowledge specifically on that topic, but it makes sense to me that we would eventually reach a place evolution-wise where we're able to do that here too.  <br><br><br>Yeah, yeah. I also remember knowing that this reality, this whole universe, is not the first time we've done this. This is like the next level. We're preceding levels, like preceding unit.  <br>This sounds great. I know that this guy, you said, "Go full woo here." No, I know. I know. Everybody's leaning. This universe is not the first time. In fact, I have a memory, part of the pre-work memory is I remember the moment that there was this intention being issued forth from source and through all of us, like we were all involved, to do this universe.  <br>And it was not the first time. The veil has been used before. I like to think of the veil as like a consciousness technology, like a spirit technology, and this is not the first time there's been a veil.  <br>Earth is not the first time. This whole universe is not the first time, but I do remember feeling that this universe had a new level of low density, like a new challenge level, to take the next level of expansion.  <br><br><br>Wow. And I feel like even talking about this is something that really would not have fit even a few years ago. So I feel like now is the time. We're all kind of trying to remember a little bit, remember.  <br>That's why we're doing things like this.  <br>Do you have a memory of, you said that there was a universe before, and then that one, this is sort of universe 2.0? Or I don't remember how many or what.  <br>Yeah, more than 2.0. Yeah, yeah. Not it's not like the second. I don't know.  <br>Do you?  <br>Okay, okay. Interesting. And then in the retraction of that breath, is the energy of that universe just re-neutralized and reused?  <br>The way I experienced it was the universe was not, I don't want to say it's not real because it is real, but it's not really real. It's like a virtual reality, like a video game, maybe.  <br><br><br>Okay, so we're, but it's a really real video game that we get to create together, and there's the in-breath and out-breath. I'm talking about is the churning of billions of years of experience and then all the integration that goes along with that for countless beings.  <br>That's another important point. There's a lot of topics here. The, there's only so many slots on Earth. There's only so many characters that can be played. There's only so many people and only so many animals and only so many choices.  <br>And there's way more conscious beings than there are slots on Earth. And in fact, I've read, and I intuit this is correct, but the number of guides there are helping us outnumber the number of players in the game, outnumber the number of humans.  <br>So anyway, being given the opportunity to play a human is super, super rare, awesome, an amazing opportunity. Like, it's like being handed the most precious gift in the universe because, you know, from that side, there are only so many, like, there's only so many, and being human is like, "Oh, my gosh, like, really? Like, holy."  <br>And the irony, of course, is that all of us here, so many of us just want to get out. You know, we're like, "We're just done with this." But I'm telling you, this is a gift. Every one of these wonderful people listening today, and I gotta say, like, the energy that I'm getting from all these people, holy cow, you guys are awesome.  <br>Every one of us has been given a gift to come here and to do our part to live. And when I say do our part, I don't want to say like, "We came to do this task." You know, we like to think in duality like, "Okay, I'm gonna do this action."  <br>It's more about being you, the real you, the loving, joyful you in your life where you are. Just do that. Just be you. Be the real you, and as you do that, we will bring love to the world because love is what we are.  <br>We are loving beings. We're not twisted, fearful beings. We do get temporarily twisted up in the many pains of this life. We do get abused, and we do suffer, and we get sick, and eventually, our bodies even die.  <br>You know, so it's super crazy, but that is not who we really are. So you're allowed. You have permission, not for me, just because of who you are, not from anybody. You have permission to not take the play so seriously.  <br>You can be yourself. Have fun. It's fun. Make it fun. Enjoy what you want to enjoy. Let go of what you want to let go of. Be the person that you feel you should be.  <br>And you know what? That's not easy. I don't know. I'm like not a master at this or something. Like, I'm just another flawed individual trudging my way through the, you know, the muck.  <br>But if we choose to meet this day, this moment with openness, it's very powerful. That small stuff is the big stuff. You know, our, that's something that guys tell us a lot. The little things are the big things.  <br>That is where the power is. So you don't have to worry about solving a huge crisis and fixing the whole world and making all your money and all that stuff. Just eat this moment, this day, the best you can. That's it.  <br>Have fun. Love the person next to you. Love yourself. Yes, face your fears. That's a big one.  <br>When you, wait, so you're saying how being here is such a gift, and so when you told your guides that you decided you wanted to try to come to Earth, was there like, what determined whether or not or when you were able to go?  <br>Was there like, you said these spots are difficult to come by.  <br><br><br>So in my case, I actually did not remember specifically asking for Earth. I just asked for a life to fulfill my intentions, and they brought me the human life. I don't even know if my last incarnation was human. I don't know.  <br>I just know that knowing that it was a human life here and seeing my parents, who would be, I had so much respect for them. It was incredible, the amount of respect I had for those players.  <br>I'm calling them players. See, the thing is like, okay, so I'm seeing them from that side as the mother and father. Those are their characters. I respected them like the player who is the character.  <br>You know, like, because the player, the soul, is who you really are. Yeah, and from their side, you know that, and you respect that. The soul is playing as this certain character, and you know, it's such an admirable thing to be seen from the other side looking at a human, at a human life.  <br>It's just incredible.  <br><br><br>So April was asking, and I think April, what she meant was, you're asking why are the guides on Earth outnumber the non-guide people? I think she was saying that the guides that are helping the people on Earth outnumber the people on Earth.  <br>I just meant non-physical beings that are participating in the Earth play outnumber the physical human players, although we're aware that there are many guides on Earth right now to help with the ascension. So I think that's why that was a little ambiguous.  <br>Sorry.  <br>[Laughter]  <br>Yeah, so no, it's just amazing to think about the perspective that you bring because I think that all of us are, you know, everybody that's here in this group has had their own different experiences of spirituality and, you know, from all different aspects.  <br>But what's amazing is, like I said, to hear this first-person recount of what you've seen and felt and had the real experience of, to have a first-person description, is just mind-bending. Totally right.  <br>I actually find it a lot. I appreciate that, but it's, I don't feel that way because I actually find it a little bit comical that everybody doesn't remember because it is a little bit funny. It's a little bit funny because it's not, you know, we all will remember.  <br>No, it's not that remarkable.  <br><br><br>Yeah, what? So Sean is asking that she has a lot of clients that really struggle to have a baby, and she has, and her belief is that there's a lineup of souls waiting to be human, but why is it so hard for them?  <br>And she's wondering what else she can do to help the people who are because she tries to help them raise their vibration, and she's wondering what else you can do to help them.  <br>Okay, well, the first half of that question is why. So okay, so the goal of, oh boy, the words are really hard here. The physical reality operates according to its rules. You know, it's law, so biological laws included.  <br>Okay, so then spirit knows the laws and looks in on the system like, okay, imagine you like program a video game, like World of Warcraft or something, you know, and you've got stuff going on in the game, and certain things happen, certain things can't happen, and you just work with what you can because the game is how it is.  <br>Except in this case, the game kind of is evolving and going on its own, but anyway, so there's these constraints that are applying to us, including things that may prevent people from having children or health problems or whatever else.  <br>And there's also a bunch of non-physical activities happening. There's a lot of manifestation happening. There's intention. There's a lot of probabilities being bumped and nudged all over the place.  <br>You know, some people might have fear of not having a child, and then they, you know, maybe push away the probability of having a child, and there's a lot of that stuff going on, and I can't possibly speak to all that.  <br>But so I'm just saying for the first part of the question, some of it is just the way the physical reality plays out sometimes. Unfortunately, it's just how the body works sometimes.  <br>But as to what they can do, oh boy, I mean, my actually my sister struggled with this. I have a lot of respect for women who go through that. I feel like as a male, I'm like, it's like impossible for me to actually feel what a woman feels that can't have a child.  <br>I know how deep it is, and then, and I'm actually chuckling because I told my wife many times that I kind of wish I could have a baby because I remember being female, but anyway.  <br>I would say that so all the things in this life that we experience, there's a lot of needs that the human has: need for food, need for reproduction, need for security, need for money, and love, physical, you know, all those things that we think we need.  <br>We do feel fear when we don't get that stuff. You know, if someone tells you you're not going to have your food anymore, you know, most people are going to feel fear, and not being able to have a baby is pretty similar, actually.  <br>And I think in the sense that we are hardwired to do that, so I don't, so just as a general comment, then when we have fear that's linked to something that is wired into what we are as humans, I think it's important that we, I know this sounds so simple and trite and oversimplified, but we need to accept.  <br>Because when we resist, it's the resistance that hurts, and typically when we resist, we're not helping ourselves. Typically when we resist, we're making it difficult. We're pushing things away, and it's the deepest intent that is nudging their probabilities.  <br>So a lot of people might say, "Okay, I really want to have a baby, so I'm going to tell myself I don't want to have a baby so that I can have a baby." But really, your deepest intent is you still really want.  <br>So what you have to do is work with your own fears. I know it's a very broad comment. Find the fears. Find like, if you feel an inadequacy, papa, need it be a, "Why do I feel that way?" You know, what?  <br>And then as you feel that, allow yourself to feel it. Allow yourself to find what is the negative self-belief I'm holding on to here, and be brave enough to work with it. And if you get to the root, that might help.  <br>Yeah, and so I know the question was about like a lineup of souls. It's not like they're, I don't want to say my perception was not like they're pushing or pushing in line and, "Please make this baby be available."  <br>It's not like that at all. Like I said, the system is operating, and then as there are opportunities, they are happily utilized.  <br>Yeah, yeah, and sometimes it's not the mother's fault. I mean, in my case, it was my fault. It's still my fault. I don't even know who that person was, but I know I'm responsible even now.  <br>And you know what I mean? So that's nothing to do with the poor mom. She probably, you know, I mean, they didn't know there's a spirit coming from another dimension that like had fear issues, you know.  <br><br><br>So she was asking, she's wondering about, is Earth the only 3D reality? And is this Earth the most beautiful place in the universe?  <br>Okay, so I'll say no. This is not the only 3D reality. So first of all, we have our whole universe, and it has many opportunities within it, not just Earth. Okay, don't we?  <br>We'd like to think of other planets as other, no, our whole universe is one place. There's other planets. There's a whole system that's big, billions and billions and billions of stars. Okay, that's one system.  <br>And I have some awareness that there are other systems, and I don't know anything about those systems, but they're there. So there are many opportunities both in our reality system, and I believe others as well.  <br>And as to whether Earth is the most beautiful, my opinion is it's all subjective. No, I feel that there is greater beauty in higher realms. The beauty of the higher realms is unspeakable.  <br>So I'm not saying, you know, Earth isn't beautiful. It has beauty, but yeah, I personally wouldn't say it's the most beautiful experience of form possible. I felt like that green grass was awfully beautiful.  <br>Oh, my gosh. All right, well, if anybody else has any other questions, go ahead and ask them now, but I think this has been, for me, this has just been so incredible.  <br>Your story, as soon as I heard it, I couldn't wait to have you come in and share it with us because I feel like it's stuff that we all know about. We've read about it. We learn about it from various sources, but you are the first person I met that can stand there and tell me from first-person experience what you're not, you know, not from a regression.  <br>Because I know that a lot of people go through past life regression, which was made like Wendy was talking about in the comments. She leads past life progressions, but in this case, it was your actual lived memory, which is just amazing.  <br><br><br>So that's, it's such a gift to have you share that with us, and it's wonderful. I think it's wonderfully encouraging because it is such a confirmation of all the things that we feel and that we suspect and that we intellectually know but that we don't have direct experience of anymore in terms of our memory.  <br>Yeah, I feel like I'm in a really weird place because, on one hand, it's extremely personal, and it's also impossible to articulate, and also, I feel like it's such a small amount of memory.  <br>You know, who am I? You know, I'm not in your death experience or, I'm just some guy. On the other hand, on the other hand, I really feel that the awakening, as we're using it, is happening.  <br>We do need to talk to each other, and we are allowed to test this. It's not like the veil is like, you know, you got a moral imperative not to, you know, play. You know, we're here to play.  <br>Yeah, so I'll take the risk. I'm, you know, I'm just deciding to take the risk and get it, put myself out there a little bit, and say, "We're not human. You're not human. You, you, this is important that you that feels like you to you is who you are."  <br>Yeah, that you, you think is human is not the you that feels like you to you is who you are. And it's funny because one time after meditating, I had this experience where I became aware of all these other lives I had lived.  <br>Just, I saw these fears. I knew that I was them, and it was like the biggest shock to me of this moment was like, "Oh, my gosh, that's me." Like, I did that. It wasn't like other people that were me. No, it was me.  <br>Like, the me that feels like me to me, what did those things? Yeah, yeah, so it's just so it is the eye, and that eye is not just, not just this character.  <br>So I think it's important we remind each other of that because our society is pretty darn unaware overall. Yeah, our world, especially up till now, has been largely asleep.  <br>We've got some serious fear issues going on in the collective. You know, we're working through them, and, you know, as we do that individually, that is what we got to do is we need our fear individually, and then that helps the collective, and we're participating in that valuable process.  <br>So yeah, wait, so I think it's important to remind each other. I'm happy to speak with anybody who would like to, you know, it's just gonna make connections with people.  <br>And can you share the name of your blog? Christian writes a blog.  <br>Yeah, it's "A Walk in the Physical." A Walk in the Physical.com.  <br>A Walk in the Physical.com. Perfect. I haven't added anything lately because I only write when I'm spirit-led on that blog. I don't just sit down and write, and I'm trying to turn that into a book.  <br>I'm in the process of doing it, so I'm like maybe 90 percent through.  <br>Supreme, yeah, sorry, because I want to try to put it in some framework that is helpful, hopefully.  <br>Wonderful. Yeah, well, you've gotten so many thank yous here. Wendy, Edward says, "Thank you. This was wonderful." She says, "I feel so comfortable with the knowing being more validated. Thank you, Christian."  <br>Edie says, "This is a wonderful, eye-opening gift. So grateful for this talk." Sheila says, "It lands like remembering, and that's cool. A resonance resonates deeply. Thanks, Christian."  <br>Amina says, "Thank you for sharing these profound experiences." Patty says, "We are immensely grateful for this talk. Thank you, Christian." Teresa says, "The veil is spinning. We will so assist be so surprised by what we encounter."  <br>And Jen says, "Thank you, Christian. Really well articulated. You convey a much larger perspective than words can convey. Thanks for being you."  <br>Yeah, Barbara says, "Support each other." Peter says, "The act on the stage with the 3D life." Sheila, Shelley, "Thank you, Christian. Your experiences are amazing." Sheila says, "Thank you, Christian. Very helpful and timely. Thank you."  <br>Ann, you're very welcome. Thank you. So anyway, thank you. Get it. Rock on, dude.  <br>Barbara, I really appreciate everybody that's here. I can see all these faces on the screen, yes, and I'm telling you what, like, this is a group of masters. You know, there's a lot of potential and power here, and it's an honor to even talk with you.  <br>I appreciate it very much, and thank all of you for everything you're doing in your lives right now, and thank you for being human. Like, you may not when you woke up this morning, you probably didn't think you're like a superhero for getting out of bed and brushing your teeth, but you are.  <br>So thank you for doing that, and we wake up tomorrow. It's okay to remind yourself of that, you know, that you are a superhero. So yeah, I just feel like that's like the one thing I just want to share with everybody.  <br>It's cool. Like, thank you for being you and for being here, and you're like, you have guides like watching over you, cheering you on too, and you know, you're not alone.  <br>For those of you who'd like the link, Michael and Sandy just posted it in the comments. I will have recorded this, and I'll be posting the recording both on YouTube and on the Wisdom Soup Facebook page.  <br>With some soup YouTube channels, if you go onto YouTube, you'll see it there. Just type in Wisdom Soup, or I'll also be posting it in my Spirit Means Business Facebook group. So either place, if you want to watch it again, you can find it there.  <br>And like I said, you can contact Christian through his blog.  <br>Thanks so much for spending the evening with us, Christian. This is just as good as I thought it was going to be, even better. So it's just amazing. So great to spend time. So thank you, everybody.  <br>Wonderful to see you guys, and I'll be sending out the next invitation again. It will be rather than doing the second Thursday, it'll be a couple of days early.  <br>If you haven't seen my videos about what's coming on the 11th, do go check it out. There's some big stuff happening. I want to make sure, excuse me, that everybody is prepared because it is something we do need to be prepared for.  <br>So thanks so much, and I will say goodbye for now.  ]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2020/an-astounding-story-of-life-between-lives.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2020/An Astounding Story of Life Between Lives.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:01:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chat with Christian Sundberg - A walk in the physical]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=pprZMt8hNcY  <br>23 JUL 2020 <br><br><br>Hey guys, I'm really excited to be here today with Christian Sundberg and to be diving into an amazing experience that he's had and learning more about, yeah, you Christian, and your interpretation of everything that happened with you. I've heard your story, but a lot of people haven't heard your story, so I'm excited to share your story more. So yeah, do you want to kind of share a little bit from there?  <br>Sure. So, it's very difficult to talk about this story because, as I shared in the other video, I feel like words just can't possibly do justice to our higher natures, to who we truly are. The context from which we come transcends duality itself. It transcends all earth form. So when I used to use words and throw metaphors at you, and then you have to interpret them within your own experience, it's just incredibly limiting, and there's very little we can actually communicate in this way. So that's just a big disclaimer up front because I feel like every time I even just open my mouth, it's just wrong. As soon as I speak, that's just how these things are.  <br>So, okay, when I was a young child, I had pre-birth memory. I remembered coming to Earth. I knew that we weren't from here naturally, that this was a place we were coming to visit and have a neat experience, and I assumed everybody knew that, but nobody talked about it, so I didn't talk about it either. I used to kind of draw upon my pre-birth memory when I was very little, and then eventually, as I got older, it faded away and passed, and eventually, I didn't remember it at all. I ended up growing up with a very mainstream mindset and belief system, and that carried through many years of my life until I was in my early 30s.  <br>What is a mainstream mindset?  <br><br><br>Yeah, mainstream life. So, I was also raised in the Lutheran church, and so in my case, I viewed the world in a very mainstream Lutheran belief system metaphor set for many years, which is fine, believing in God and Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. I did, and I don't even say "did" in the past tense. To me, I always knew that they were metaphors in a way. The word "God," what is that? So I pursued a relationship with the divine through that metaphor set, and I had certain beliefs that I had been brought up with about that. I had no memory at that time of what I'm about to share.  <br>So for me, it was like once the memory was gone, I just learned what was taught to me. The church was the place in society where, if there's spiritual stuff going on, there's a bigger context, and the place in society that existed to teach you about that was the church. There wasn't really anywhere else, and that's where they talked about God and the spirit and eternal life and these things that I just intuitively sensed existed. So that's just the way I pursued it.  <br>But then, in my early 30s, I was actually watching a Tom Campbell video because I was always searching. I was always seeking, and seeking is just naturally what I do or who I am. He said one sentence in the video that sent me down this whole path. He said, "What you believe is not going to get you anywhere particularly important. The belief itself is not going to get you anywhere important." It stung when he said it. It hurt my ego, and I was like, "Oh, I don't like that." But when I felt that, a little voice inside me just kind of nudged, "Why does that hurt? Why does that sting?" I was like, "Yeah, why does that sting?"  <br>So I watched Tom Campbell's Spain lecture, and I was fascinated. I bought his book. It's funny because I got the book. His book's a hefty tome. I got it, and I'm standing in my garage, looking at this book. This is before I went down before I had the gun meditation practice or anything, 10 years ago or so, and I thought, "Man, am I really going to read this book? How big this is, it's going to take a while." I opened up the first sentence of the preface, and it says, "Yes, you need to take the time to read the preface." I thought, "Well, this guy knows me."  <br><br><br>So anyway, I learned what I could from Tom's videos. I started reading his book, and most importantly, I began meditating. I was not expecting anything. I just began meditating because the first few times I did, I felt life feels really good. I'm experiencing some relief and some things I don't understand. After I meditated for just a few months, I actually had my first non-physical experience spontaneously, and it actually scared the crap out of me because it was so real.  <br>It wasn't like a wishful imagination thing. In this case, I was sleeping, and I was having a dream that I was about to be killed. In the dream, I said to myself, "Okay, let go, leave your body now," because I thought I was about to die. Suddenly, I was in a state of extreme vibrations, and I was awake. I was fully lucid. My body was not awake, but I was fully awake and lucid, and I was experiencing these very violent vibrations. It sounded like there was a jet engine on either side of my head. It was so loud, and I was stuck there for a few seconds, and I was like, "What is this?" When I finally woke up, I jumped out of bed. I physically leapt out of my bed because I was so freaked out by how intense this experience was.  <br><br><br>That was just the first of what turned out to be many experiences that were very eye-opening. As I continued to meditate, I didn't anticipate this, but I just suddenly started having memory return to me that I had when I was a child that I'd forgotten. Memory about why I came, what this life is, what I'm doing here. It's been very helpful, and I know why it was very important that I forgot. I would not have been able to experience the trauma that I did in my 20s, which was a very important part of why I came. I came to face a fear, to feel and integrate this very low vibration. I don't know how to describe it, but this certain vibration that had bested me is the best way I can put it in another experience in a past life.  <br>In that past life, I had experienced an agonizing death as a result of what this fear did to me and where it took me. So I now know that it was important that I re-engaged a very challenging sensation of fear and experience of fear in this life.  <br>So yeah, I know there's a lot. What you just shared is really hitting home for me. Okay, so you said you came in here and you had these memories of what life was like before you came in here as a child, right? But then as you started growing up, around maybe five or six, definitely by seven, these memories faded, and then all you knew was this reality that here you are, Christian Sundberg. That's what you are, and that's all that there is.  <br>Yeah, growing up as a Christian in a Christian family, and then by the time you're in your early 30s, you're learning how to meditate, and through meditation, you get these experiences that kind of come, all these memories come flooding back to you where you remember all the things that you did before you were here. You remember life before you came into this reality.  <br>Yes, okay, so share a little bit about that. What was it like before you came into this reality?  <br><br><br>Yeah, so it's a lot. It's a long story, and it's hard. It's very hard to share, so I'll just say as concise as I can. So I remember a very long time ago, before I had ever incarnated in this reality, being inspired by a being who had been physical, who had incarnated. The quality of his being, the quality of his nature was so full of light and joy and power. It was incredible, and I was inspired by him to go down this path and to begin to integrate experience. It's the only English words I can think of, to come into experiences like this with a certain level of denseness and to meet them ultimately with love.  <br>As Tom Campbell says, it sounds almost frightening to meet it with love, but love is our true nature. Who we really are, what we really are, is freedom and joy and power and bliss. Then we apply what we are into these very specific contexts, and it's so exciting for the soul to do that. There's just the most profound, blessed, amazing honor. I don't know how else to put it, to be given the opportunity to do this because there's only so many opportunities like in our reality. There's only so many people, only so many things, so there's a limited number of opportunities, and when you're given one, it's like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so honored," even though it could be very challenging here.  <br>Here we are, and for me, because I must be coming from a limited mindset, I'm like, "What do you mean there's like seven and a half billion?" So that's a very small number in comparison to the breadth of the higher realities, and I can't put words on that very well. But the finite net, okay, so I don't know if you imagine an extremely big number, like trillions or something, and you've got a few million slots here going on at the moment. Anyway, I don't know. It's really hard to explain. It's just that from that side, it's just a profound opportunity.  <br>So in my case, I had a previous experience. I took a break afterwards of not being physical for quite a while. Okay, so previous experience in this physical matter reality. I don't know, I was some physical being. I was physical somewhere, right? Then I had a break, and then I decided I wanted to go back. So then I met with a guide. I remember this guy coming to me and asking, "Are you ready to go back yet?"  <br><br><br>This is very hard to explain because everybody wants to know what did that feel like and where was that. For me, it was more like reminding me of my own intention. Okay, so like, "Okay, okay, you're right." So then I got with this guide, and the guide was like, "Time to get back to work, Christian. Come on." It was kind of like that, but it's like, so we reviewed who I am and what I am, who I've been, and there was it was obvious the thing that I needed to do, the thing I needed to work on. There were many areas that I had accomplished or achieved, but I had been able to actualize myself in a loving way in certain areas.  <br>I felt there's a theme I need to articulate here. So there's this expansion of being that is integral to what we're doing here. This is so important, and we're all walking around our lives forgetting that we're doing this, most of us. This is so hard to explain, but imagine you have source as a point of light, and then if you can go this far away and you can integrate this experience and fully be here and actualize who you really are here, then the growth of being comes to there.  <br>There's like this opportunity for expansion. What is it? The expansion of what is possible. It's the expansion of love. It's the expansion of joy, lasting joy. It's the expansion of power. It's the expansion of what is, and there's a profound joy that's associated with that expansion. So that's important.  <br>So then, in my specific case, I knew that there was a fear that I had experienced in a previous life that was one of my lowest vibrations because duality itself is transcended, but anyway, I had an experience, a life where I was completely overcome by this fear, and I had been an extremely high entropy person to put it in Tom Campbell's terms.  <br>In my last incarnation, this isn't my last incarnation, this is at some point in the past, and it was like a glaring, "Whoa, I can't believe I have that much fear that I can cause that much damage." But it was a profound opportunity, and this fear was so intense that I remember asking my guide because I knew it would be very challenging, super not easy, but when you're on that side, you know you're immortal and that you're powerful enough. There's nothing to fear, so I'm like, "I want to do that."  <br>But I remember asking the guide, "Has it ever been done in all of creation? Has any other being ever done something this extreme, this vibrational extreme?" And I was shown yes and basically reminded, "You don't have to do it at once. You have all of eternity available to you. You've been given all this time."  <br>I thought, so it's totally funny because right now, as a human, this seemed so alien to me, but at the time, I remember fully knowing with this total confidence, "If it can be done, I can do it. If it can be done, I will do it." It wasn't like a pride thing or anything like that. It was like I just knew what we are. I just knew I had a desire to do good because when you accomplish this as a soul, you're not only expanding yourself, you're helping the whole.  <br>We're performing a service right now. Every single person listening to this video today, even if they don't remember it, is performing a very important service just by being here. This is not the easy class. This is not the place to come for a foot-up-on-the-couch vacation. This is a very intense experience engine or something. We're very intense, very in-your-face. You don't remember who you are. You've got to deal with all the stuff of life. You've got to feed your body, take it to the bathroom, earn a living, deal with pain and judgment and all those things. You've got to deal with that every day.  <br>So anyway, back to my story. I knew that I wanted to engage that fear. They brought me a life that was perfect for me to do that, and I accepted that life. But immediately after accepting the veil, the veil of forgetfulness, which is just what we call it as a word, basically, it's the adoption of the constraints and consciousness space that overcome you and allow you to be fully here. It's like a deep, deep dive down into a vacuum where you are obscured.  <br>All of a sudden, it's an extremely abrupt plummet. It's like taking the blue pill in The Matrix, the one where you forget. You just forget, like nothing ever happened. In this case, it's forgetting, but it's very abrupt.  <br>There's a quote by Seth where he says something like, "To be effective, many of you die and don't even realize you died. You're just there on the other side, and all of a sudden, you look down, your body is there, you're done with your life, and you move on." You may not even notice the transition of that physical death, but incarnation is not like that. Incarnation is very abrupt and extremely noticeable because you're going from a place of all connectedness and joy and freedom down into this tuna can of the human body.  <br>What did you say? The tuna can?  <br>Yeah, like a small metal container that you get shoved down within. Anyway, so in this case, I accepted the veil, and that process happened. But each lifetime has its own vibrational place, the only way I can put it, like its own state of vibration that you arrive to. I assume that's biological or something. There's some state of vibration that you arrive to after accepting the veil and incarnating.  <br><br><br>As soon as I arrived, I was overwhelmed by the lowness of the vibration of what I had just accepted, and I immediately changed my mind once I was there. So in this experience, it's actually very emotional, but I rejected the experience, and I mustered my might. I summoned who I am and said, "I'm not doing this." I smote it, and I was out. I was freed.  <br>I knew immediately I had a life review because I had inadvertently killed the fetus that was to be my body, that was to be me, and the mother had a miscarriage. I knew the pain that I cost her, and I don't know who she is. I don't know when it happened. All I know is that I caused a lot of pain, and I knew not only the pain I caused her but hundreds of other people that she would affect in her life in a different way because of the loss that she experienced from me.  <br>I went in with all these great intentions, and I was like, "I had all this positive intention," and that had happened. So I was very disappointed in myself. I mean, nothing is wrong from that state because you can just see everything is well. Everything's fine. It's just a play. There's nothing to be afraid of. She's fine. I'm fine. Everyone's fine, but I was very disappointed in myself in an objective way. I was like, "I just can't believe I did that."  <br>So that was a really good opportunity that was wasted. Before they brought me this life, I remember practicing accepting the veil and going through that vibrational plummet again. I guess I'd call that in the other video a veil acceptance simulator or something. Some place that you go, and it's not a real veil, but it's like the veil, and you have to surrender to it and practice giving up your control and letting it come over you and being fully present with it.  <br>So then I remember them coming to me and telling me it was time. Okay, so they brought me this life. I reviewed it in detail, and I remember reviewing a vast flowchart of millions of possibilities of what this life might be like. Millions, I mean, all within a blink of an eye. It was not hard. It was easy to review millions of possibilities of what could happen, and there were many things that were very likely to happen and some things that were less likely to happen, but it was not really about the events. It was more about how it would be, how I would feel, who I would be, and what things might I feel like, how other people might be affected.  <br>So I reviewed that, and I knew that a trauma would likely be following in my early 20s, which would crush me and help me to re-enter, re-experience this fear, and that did happen. That did happen. I had post-traumatic stress from a health crisis I had in China when I was 22, and I dealt with that for maybe seven or eight years of counseling and inner work.  <br>This all happened before I began meditating because I feel like it was important that I did all that without any knowledge of this, and it was only because I've been able to meet a certain element, a certain angle of this fear, that that memory returned, and now it acts as an inspiration to keep going. My own intent inspires me, even though it's hard. Being human is, I'm not saying being human is always hard, but it has a very high constraint set that goes along with it, and there's a very good possibility for extreme difficulty for many people.  <br>So anyway, I reviewed the chart, the flowchart, what I'm calling it. I remember them getting my attention like, "When it's time to go, like, you gotta go now." All of a sudden, I was timeless or something. I was in this state where it was just, all of a sudden, they came, and it was like, "Now you gotta go now. Now you're on Earth time. You gotta get moving."  <br>I remember these beings that helped facilitate the application of the veil over me and the incarnation. I refer to them as tinkerers because that's the only English word I can think of that kind of matches, but they're beings that are technical in the application of the veil, and that's what they do. What they do is they're able to discern your personal who you are, your vibration, all that you are, and match it somehow to all that the life is.  <br>They do this thing where, like, I don't know, they make it work, and then before you go, they say, "One last time, are you sure? Because once you say sure, this is it. This is the last chance button." You know, I said yes, and then I remember the veil coming over me and surrendering to it and being completely overcome.  <br>I feared again. The vibrational plummet was like, I don't know if you imagine like a sound amp that has a pitch coming out of it that's really high, like a high pitch, and you turn down the knob, imagine turning it lower and lower and lower. After you get to the low point, you just keep cranking it lower. That's how it felt in the being to come all the way down into here.  <br>So I held on, and I did my best to just not fight it because I just knew that as long as I didn't fight it, I'd be fine. They're gonna take care of the rest, and I just need to let it sink in and take hold of me, and that happened. Then I was in the womb for a while, and this part is very emotional for me, but I reached another point where I said, "That's not happening. I'm not doing this. This vibration is so low. This is, I'm trapped. I don't like this. I'm not doing this."  <br><br><br>So once again, I decided to summon my might to fight my way out again, and this is a holy moment for me, but the spirit of God came to me, and it showed me who I really am, who we all really are. It was beautiful, and I knew I was still connected to all that is. The spirit basically communicated, "You're this. This is still who you are. You can never not be this."  <br>It's the most beautiful thought to me because I can't wait to be there again, but anyway, at the time, it calmed me. It made me like, "Oh, okay, that's awesome. Great. Okay, I like kind of going." I let myself just kind of surrender to being in the womb, and it was very peaceful and tight but peaceful. I remember feeling just like coming and going, and then the day of my birth came.  <br><br><br>I don't remember any, okay, I remember sensations, and then I remember one visual image only from the day I was born. I remember the room after they pulled me out, and later, when I was older, I described the room to my mother, and I drew where the bed was, where the window was, where the heating grate was, where the doctor was standing, and she said I was right. I know it would be, but that memory to me always seemed holy when I thought back on it, that memory of being born.  <br>I remember being intensely curious the day I was born. I remember looking up at the doctors and thinking, "Who are these beings? Where am I? What is going on?" There was no context, though. There was no meaning. I didn't know anything about what was going on and zero. I was just a clean slate, so I just looked upon these beings that were in the room with just love actually and awe and wonder like, "Oh, they're doing something for me that's so wonderful. Who are they? Why do I hurt? What is going on?" It was just very intense.  <br>So that's my earliest memory, and then I don't have very much memory until I was older. I remember this is a story I shared in the other video too, but I remember when I was about three or so, however old you are when you're still wearing a diaper and learning how to walk. I remember standing in my diaper at this couch, and my parents had a neighbor friend over to the house.  <br><br><br>I remember assuming properties of the other reality would be true here because that's just how things are, and one of the things that was true there that I expected would be true here is that we would be able to feel each other's emotions, just share our feelings because in another reality, there's this telepathic sharing of feeling that's very normal. There's data dumps back and forth, and you just know how they're feeling and how you're feeling. There's no misunderstanding.  <br>Well, here, I remember telling this neighbor friend, "Watch me dance," and my parents put some music on the record player, and I was feeling very funky. I remember shaking my little push around, and the neighbor friend walked away unimpressed, and it just dawned on me like, "She can't feel what I'm feeling. What the heck? Where am I that she can't feel what I'm feeling? What is going on?" It seemed so alien to me that I was in a place where this was not possible.  <br><br><br>I feel like all throughout my life, actually, I've had these certain assumptions that I have to keep telling myself, "No, that's just not how it works on Earth." I don't know, like, I feel like in other systems, your intent is known, and your intent is what's important. Like, if you have a job, and you're arriving with the right effort and intent, that's what's important. Well, here, it's not really about that. It's totally like on the surface. It's all about how you're being perceived.  <br>Another thing was, I always assumed that people in positions of power or authority were beings of great love and wisdom. So I assumed that if they were teaching at my school, they must be loving beings, and if they were the mayor of a city, that must be a really evolved being, and if they were the president of the United States, that person must be the most loving and wise person. That's not how it works on Earth. That's not how it is, especially at the moment. That's my opinion.  <br><br><br>So I was kind of dumbfounded and perplexed, and eventually, the memory left me like I said, and I didn't remember any of that. Then when it returned to me, I was just very surprised that it ever left. I was just like, "How did I ever forget that? It's the most natural thing in the world." In fact, the memory is like alive now. It's not like an Earth memory that happened kind of in the past and it's kind of blurry. No, it feels like it's right now, and it's super real, like super unreal, even more real than a physical event.  <br>I don't know how to describe it, but it's not like an earthly memory. It's more like this confidence, this knowing in your true nature and what is real, whereas everything here feels like a black and white movie. It's not fake. It's a real black and white movie, but it's black and white. That's the best way I can put it.  <br>When I say the memory feels real, it's like that is who we really are on the other side. This is like wearing a shirt or a spacesuit maybe. We're like looking out of the thick glass, and we're clunking around. This is not the norm for the being. This is an experience, and the experience is occurring within that which is still there. The spirit, the consciousness itself, is already there, already connected to all that is. It's just like a big illusion. It's not an illusion because it's real. This experience is real, but the content of the experience is not fundamental. It's a non-fundamental experience.  <br><br><br>It's kind of like a dream, like a very real dream. It's very intense, and because it's very intense, it has a very high opportunity for expansion, for growth. The further we can go, the more real, the more engaging it is, the greater the opportunity. Many spirits, I mean, everybody, I think that different spirits have different habits on how they approach incarnation, but many, from my understanding, try to do the hard things. They like doing it all at once, coming in and really getting their hands dirty because if they can do that, they know the incredible expansion and joy that is possible.  <br>The guides may even remind them, "Hey, that might be too much. You might want to not lay off that much," and usually, it's the incarnating spirit that says, "No, I want to do that. I want it to be challenging." Well, here we are, and this place can be pretty challenging.  <br>What do you think about most beings on this planet that are playing this game? Do you feel that most beings are given or have chosen to be here and to incarnate into a specific life, or do you feel like most of us are just here, and we're playing, we're fumbling around?  <br>Well, I don't know because I only know what I went through, but I believe it's likely that the vast majority of people here specifically pick their life because I remember the incredible amount of detail that I reviewed this life beforehand with what could be like. For instance, I knew the details about my parents and who they were, not as names but as beings.  <br>It's like who you really are as the being. You're not really the character, so it's the being as the character, and I remember like the confidence my father would instill in me. I knew that would be very important for me because I knew that I would have to be confident, or else it would be almost impossible for me to meet this fear. I needed that confidence to get through the fear, and it would be a tool.  <br>So that's, and then my father did raise me to be very confident. He always, if I may ask, what was the fear that you overcame?  <br>Yeah, and the process of overcoming it. So we like to put words on things, so we like to say the fear is like a fear of spiders or something like that. It's not quite that simple. The fear is a vibration, and if I had to describe it, it would be the inability to escape agony mixed with being too proud to suffer.  <br>It took me a lot of years to finally get to that because we bury our fears underneath many layers, hundreds of layers of ego to protect us. When I first started going through counseling, I was going through EMDR, which is a form of therapy, and you'd go, you'd hit a layer, and you'd find something in yourself that was really scary, and like, "Oh, that's it. That's gotta be it. That's the root," and then you'd find another layer that's even deeper. "Oh, now that's gotta be it." It went on and on and on and on, and it was like I found it took me years to finally re-experience the most terrifying moment for me.  <br><br><br>I was in a hospital in Chengdu, China, and I thought I was dying, and I experienced the same fear that I had had before, and it was just really hard to describe. It's a fear of being completely unable to escape pain and rejecting it because you're too proud. I don't know how to describe it, but it's something along those lines.  <br>So the way for me has been, this is a huge topic that we could talk for hours about, but for me, one of the most important aspects of meeting this fear and healing is allowing it and allowing myself to feel. See, we reject things because we don't want to feel them. We're like, "I don't like feeling alone. I don't like feeling shameful. I don't like feeling powerless." Well, this is like the most powerless, like the most extreme, and I'm choosing to feel it, and when it comes, if it comes, and I have certain experiences that arise because of that, and that's okay.  <br>When they come up, I'm willing. I'm choosing to be willing to allow reality to arrive to me how it will, and that's my own walk. I feel like everybody can benefit to some extent to allow reality to arrive to them as it will because reality is not your enemy.  <br>In my specific case, it has to do with my feelings, my fears. I'm a very sensitive person, so I feel like I live in a world that is not really built for me. It's very like on a day-to-day basis, and I'm successful. I mean, I do all the things I need to do, and I have a human accomplishment, but it's very difficult for me.  <br>I found that just allowing myself to experience whatever arrives, whatever feeling arrives, and not to fight it off but be of it and allow it to allow me to feel it because otherwise, you're going to bury it. If you bury it, it's still there. It's still down there, and then it causes problems, and that's what the ego does. The ego says, "No, I'm not powerless. I'm just gonna, I'm not powerless because look, I did this, and I did this, and I accomplished this, and look who I am."  <br>See, that's what no, that doesn't work. You may think that works, but it doesn't work. You feel how you feel, and if the thing is, the now moment is the one now moment. This one now is all the moments, so if in a now moment you experience some feeling, it's still there. So don't worry if it arrives into this now. Allow yourself to feel. No feeling will kill you.  <br>No feeling will kill you, and even if your body would die someday, that's okay. You're gonna die. We're all gonna die. Our bodies are gonna pass. There's no such thing as death. It's just the biggest misunderstanding of this world. We're all running around trying to consume things and avoid thinking about our fears and avoid thinking about death, and we don't want to look, especially in the USA. We don't want to look at death too much. We just put it over here in a corner, and it's part of life. We're all going to pass.  <br>Yeah, we're going to pass, and from there, we're going to let go of this life experience packet, as Tom would say, and move on to the next one. Exactly.  <br>Yeah, exactly. So I like the point that you made earlier where you said it was necessary for you to forget and to come here in order for you to learn something or to experience trauma. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Why was it necessary?  <br>To speak to your question, I'm going to open something up on my computer. I'm going to have to step away. I actually have been working on a book for a number of years, and I'm getting close. I'm trying to answer these kinds of questions in a succinct way, not that I have all the answers. I don't, but I feel like people need to know.<br><br><br>So as I look for that, I'll just say, when you know your true nature, there's nothing to fear. Now, it's not like you need something to fear. We don't need fear, but our true nature is beyond harm and without limitation. Our native being is powerful and unharmable.  <br>So the veil allows us to focus on the physical experience all the way. It allows us to completely be this person, this character. If you didn't have the veil, you wouldn't be this character. You'd be the thing you already are that's connected to everything and is without limitation.  <br>Imagine if you knew that you were connected to the sun. Imagine if you knew the sun was in you, of you. How would that affect how you got up in the morning and went about your day? It would affect that a lot. So there's a very practical purpose.  <br>I'm gonna find this. I'm sorry, this is taking them off. No, yeah, okay.  <br><br><br>So I just named four reasons that I thought of. So the first is, the veil allows us to have the very specialized experience of creaturehood and make choices from this very deep and convincing perspective, to make choices as if you're only this human personality, which is the very crux of what makes this experience so valuable. You have to do it from the perspective from here. Doing it from here is you having this experience.  <br>If you didn't have the experience of being Vanessa, you wouldn't be Vanessa. You wouldn't have all the profound opportunity of experience that goes along with being Vanessa. So it's a little bit like saying, "Why do we have to be the person we are?" Well, because that's how it works.  <br>Then number two, the veil allows us to focus on the physical, which is important because if we didn't have it, we'd get distracted because the higher realms are incredibly beautiful and fun and joyful and wonderful. So if you were constantly aware of that, it'd be very hard to stay focused and not get distracted in this experience.  <br>Three, the veil protects us from painful homesickness. Okay, and I say that because the contrast is so great to be here as human that if you're like here and you know about there, it's super painful to be here because you miss there so much. That is actually why I'm very grateful that I don't have more memory like some of them every return, and I'm so glad it's so limited. I'm glad I only have a tiny little bit of memory come up because that tiny little bit of memory equals a lot of homesickness, and I am just so homesick.  <br><br><br>I want to go home. I don't even know where home is. I want to go home. I don't know where it is. I don't see it, but I know it's not here. Aaron's telling me this is my home, but it's not here.  <br>Yeah, that's it. So imagine if you knew that tangibly on the tip of your, oh, it's like driving mad.  <br>Yeah, and we've both experienced it. It does drive me mad.  <br>Yeah, I'm sure.  <br>And the fourth thing I'd say is, the veil allows you to have a clean slate each time because if you have past lives, they're not other people. They're you. You have done other things. It's kind of like, okay, this is a very rough metaphor that's just coming to mind, but let's say every day of the week, you went and did a different activity. You know, Monday you went rock climbing, Tuesday you went to the movies, Wednesday you went over to this restaurant, whatever. It's still you doing those experiences. It's not like a different person each day, even though you may feel very different when you're rock climbing than when you're watching the movies.  <br>It's kind of like that. It's like you are still the you between experiences, but what happens is, in any given experience, especially in a physical reality like this where the constraints are so high, we do tend to get hung up in fear, and we tend to get snagged on certain associations. We associate with certain beliefs or requirements or whatever, the ego thing. We associate deeply with them, and many people go to their graves with some limiting idea that they're just really grabbing hold tight to.  <br><br><br>So one thing that the veil allows you to do is you start over. You have no history, no context when you come. You're a new person, a new free will awareness unit, as Tom Campbell's term. You've got no baggage. Exactly, no baggage. So that's another important reason because then you're able to just start completely fresh, and then it's a new growth opportunity.  <br>And then when you're finished, only not even when you're finished, I don't make a distinction between then and now because it's now. It's all now, but to the soul, the personality of this one person that you are is precious. So it's very additive to be this now, this person. It's just so valuable to the soul. So in that way, the veil is a very additive thing.  <br><br><br>I get the sense, again, the words are so limiting, but I get the sense that we could call the veil something like consciousness technology, something that spirit came up with to facilitate expansion in incredible ways, and it's been refined. This isn't the first time either. This universe isn't the first time a veil has been used, but anyway, so I guess that's kind of like my high-level answer to that question with English.  <br>That's a great answer. Thank you for that. Wow, this is amazing, Christian. So much to, I love the way you put it, and I think that a lot of us feel the way that you're describing, and yeah, we don't know how to create words yet, which is why it's so valuable for you to be sharing your story and sharing your experiences so we don't feel alone, so that we can be like, "Wow, you too? Really? Oh my gosh, okay, I'm not crazy. There's others out there."  <br><br><br>Oh no, you know you're not. I really want to reiterate that to those who are listening. You're not crazy, and you're not alone. We are all connected. We are all brothers and sisters. I don't care who you are listening to this video. You are my brother and sister. We're a family, every one of us, so we've got to be there for each other.  <br>This is, and now's the time, and I just kind of get fired up. You know, I walk down the street, and I see people getting really hung up on things and being mean to each other, and I just want to be like, "Yo, you're playing a game. Don't take it so seriously. Try to have fun, and by the way, you're an immortal spirit who's not going to die."  <br>I just want to, but the thing is, as you know, and as Tom Campbell said many times, people are ready for what they're ready for where they are, and that's fine. I know that there's a lot of people that are not even interested in the higher context, and that's totally fine, but I do feel compelled to at least say something, and it hasn't been easy.  <br>I have some in-laws that are very conservative, and there's been a lot of friction caused in that, and you know, anytime you put yourself out there, you're going to get challenged. I don't think of myself as some teacher or anything like that. I'm just me, but I have put myself out there. I have a blog, and I have the other video I shared.  <br><br><br>I'm going to be publishing a book, which I intend to give away so that there's not a misunderstanding about what I'm trying to do with this book. I'm not trying to make money. I'm trying to share the information.  <br>What's your blog?  <br>The blog is "A Walk in the Physical" dot com.  <br>A Walk in the Physical dot com. That's right.  <br>Yeah, I've read some of your blog. Basically, the book is from the blog because the blog has been very spirit-led, and I go back and read what I've written, and I don't even believe it came through me, but all I do is I know when I feel spirit come, and I just let go and just use my ability of English, and I'll just write it down, and it's just really worked out.  <br>I'm piecing it together, and one of the things I know I really want to do in this life before this is over is I must get this book out there, even if it only reaches one person. I just know I need to get it in the physical.  <br>So yeah, I relate to what you're saying. It's my roundabout way of saying it, but I relate very much to we need to encourage each other and remind each other of who we really are and to not take this tumultuous play so seriously.  <br>Oh, beautiful. Thank you, Christian. What a great way to kind of sum it up there. Thank you so much for giving me the time to connect and for being so vulnerable and open and real. I truly respect you and value this, so thank you.  <br>You're welcome. We all need to be real. We've got to be real with each other. We can't just, let's think the thing about spirituality. Just make one last comment. The spirituality stuff is not like a faraway fairy tale land. People like to think of science, I think sometimes in religious circles, it's like, "So here we're on Earth, and that spirituality stuff is somewhere else, and it's out there, and I want to go, and maybe it's real. I'm going to believe in it or not."  <br><br><br>Now, this spirituality is the search for exactly what is real and underneath all the thoughts and all the associations that we have that we think make us who we are. Underneath all that, the most real thing is spirit, is consciousness, the thing that we are, the thing that is here now listening to this, the you that is here. That's what's real.  <br>So we have to constantly make choices, and we might not have to, but we have the opportunity to constantly make choices to better reflect that in this place because that thing that we are, that true nature that we are, is of love and freedom and joy and effortlessness and openness. It's not what we are. It's not a thing of stress and pain. This is not what it is.  <br>So the more authentic we can be and the more genuine we can be about how we feel and how we relate to each other and about how we take care of those around us and how we meet our common moment, just the common simple moments, there's so much power in that.  <br><br><br>I think on Earth, we tend to get so distracted about, "Oh, we've got these big problems. We've got these governments we've got to fix. We've got this." Don't worry about all that. Just meet this moment with openness and love, and that's it. The small stuff is the big stuff.  <br>Totally. Yeah, very encouraging message.  <br>It is, and it ends up life ends up becoming fun and playful when you exactly.  <br>Right. Yeah, I love that video you did of the spider in your bathtub.  <br>Yeah, that's right. I watched that, and you picked it up with a cup, and then you threw the entire cup outside. I just want to tell you that I laughed so hard at that.  <br>Yeah, I did too afterwards. It's like, "I'm such a dork," but you know what, you were being genuine, and you just threw the cup outside, and I laughed so hard, and it was, I just thought I'd share that. That's like the little stuff is what's important.  <br>Yeah, like, I know we have to wrap it up, but it reminds me of a near-death experience I read where the gentleman had his life review, and he saw the most profoundly beautiful moment of his life was this time that he was a child, and he had been on a road trip with his parents, and they stopped at a stop to get gas or something, and there was a river nearby, and he went down the river and rinsed something out, and he had a bucket with him, and he noticed there was a dry tree out of the way, and he filled the bucket and walked over to the dry tree and watered it even though the bucket was heavy for him and uncomfortable for him to carry.  <br>He didn't ever think of it again. He never thought about that little event that he did, and all he did is water a tree one time, and it was the most celebrated, wonderful, beautiful moment of his life, one of them. That was the one he highlighted in his life review.  <br>I think that's important for us to remember because we keep thinking about all these things we've got to do. We've got to make these changes. We've got to pay these bills. We've got to fix these systems. We've got to do all this. Okay, just meet yourself, meet your world, meet the person next to you the best you can. Water the plant.  <br>Yeah, and slow down. Right, slow down. Oh my gosh, yes.  <br>Yeah, and enjoy life and not be so caught up in the next thing.  <br>Oh, I'm so happy. I love this. Thank you, Christian.  <br>You're welcome. Anytime.  <br>Okay, yeah, let's do this again. I would love to do it again. Let's both slow down and make more time for this.  <br>Okay, awesome. Yeah, like maybe once a month, we can have a catch-up. That'd be fun.  <br>Okay, cool. Let's do it then.  <br>So yeah, I'll reach out to you in a few weeks, and we'll schedule.  <br>Great. Let's do it. Thank you, Christian.  <br>Thank you, Vanessa. Have a good day.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2020/chat-with-christian-sundberg-a-walk-in-the-physical.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2020/Chat with Christian Sundberg - A walk in the physical.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:01:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Episode 12 - Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[

I'm Bruce, along with April and Sherry here. Before we get started, just take a moment to remind people while we're here. It's all about people whose journeys take them away from religion, like many of us. In our childhood, we were devoted to a religion, and at one point in our lives, that religion didn't fit our needs anymore, so we found our way out. This show is not about bashing religion in any way. It's about finding your spiritual path and adjusting once you leave the tight controls of a religion.<br>With that, I don't know if you met those of you tuned in last week. We were talking briefly about Sherry working on cutting the energetic ties with her old religion. So, I'm going to turn it over to April and Sherry to kind of talk about what's happening in April and Jerick, and maybe give you a quick little update before we bring Christian on.<br>Cool. Yeah, so Friday, we had the three of us meet up because, in this process, which we are going to explain to the audience in more depth next week, the actual process, Bruce has kindly volunteered to be my energetic guide through this. So, he walked me through the opening meditation to start the process, and since then, I have had emotions come up and some energetic happenings. <br>I've had the dreams, which are really interesting, which April will get into, I believe, next week, right April? You're going to touch on those, but I did want to let everyone know that I will post a more comprehensive update on the Facebook page, and we are going to save the really meaty, juicy stuff for next week on our show. I think we're going to devote the show to having a discussion so people really can get walked through the process. What do you guys think? Sounds good? Yeah, okay, we'll do it then.<br><br><br>Good. And now, April's going to introduce our guest. I almost don't even want to introduce him because I just want to bring him out so bad. I'm like, let's just skip that. So, today's guest is Christian Sundberg. He has a fascinating story. He's able to remember his experience in the womb. He has memories of planning his life before he went into the womb. He remembers why he was motivated to incarnate in the first place. He remembers his life before he came to Earth, and that is so fascinating to me. He also grew up in a religion, so we'll explore just a teeny tiny bit, but I really want him to share his stories and his wisdom. He's so wise and wonderful. Let's bring him out.<br>Hi, Christian. Welcome. <br>Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.<br>Okay, so you said that you were willing to share your pre-birth experience story. Do you want to just jump into that? <br>Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so first of all, before I begin to attempt to speak to it, I just need to make the disclaimer that these kinds of things that we're trying to talk about are so vastly beyond language. There are no words that can be used to properly articulate the nature of who we truly are and the higher realms. It's just not possible because words are symbols. They're a form of our world, and who we are fully is transcendent. It's just beyond anything in this universe that we're in. So, I just have to make that disclaimer because every time I even open my mouth, it's just wrong. It just can't be right.<br>So, okay, so when I was a small child, I had memory of existing before I had come to Earth, and I remember choosing to come. This is before the age of five or six. Definitely by the age of six, I had forgotten it, but up until the age of five or six, it was like daily referenced memory for me for a while. I used to kind of like cheat a little bit to see what I was gonna expect in my day-to-day life because I had seen ahead before I had incarnated what I could expect, and I was like drawing on that memory constantly. It got harder as I got older. I wasn't allowed to cheat anymore as I got older, as I got more and more focused on the physical content.<br><br><br>But anyway, so then when I grew up, I had no memory of that after the age of six, and it wasn't until around the age of 30—right now, my body is 40 years old—that I began a meditation practice, and I certainly wasn't expecting anything. But after meditating for some number of months, I began to have non-physical experiences, and I also began to have this memory returned to me. When it did, it was so normal and natural, and it was just like, how did I ever forget that? It's like the most normal, natural, and close-to-me thing, and it's not like an earthly memory that gets fuzzy. It's nothing like that. It was so personal and so real and so vivid, and I'm like, how did I ever forget that? And I know why I forgot. It's the nature of the veils, the nature of being here and being physical.<br>So then, I didn't share the memory at all for like maybe seven or eight years. It was only about two or two and a half years ago that I felt that the timing was finally okay to share this. I just didn't feel like it was the right time. So here we are. The story is extremely personal, but I feel like it's important that we speak to each other and that we remind each other because I'm here to tell you, we are not human. We are far more than this human experience. Who you are listening today, you are you. You're the you that feels like you to you, and that you is having the experience of being this person, this human. And you know, we're much more, much more than that.<br><br><br>So, okay, so now to back it way up, and again, I can't really—time is really strange in this too because these experiences, you have a sequence, but they also feel to me like they're kind of happening all at once. So, I can't really identify exactly like, oh, there's this and less than this, but there is a sequence too. So, I'll start at the beginning as far as I remember, and that is a long, long, long time ago before I was ever physical at all, before I'd ever had any physical experiences. I had come across as being who had been physical, and when I came across him, I was so in awe of and inspired by the quality of his being, that was nature, who he was. It's really hard to describe this, but it's like the quality of who he was was so vibrant and full of joy and life.<br>I remember even asking him like, wow, I feel this joy because we share each other's emotions. We share feelings there, and I remember feeling it from him and asking him, wow, do you really experience what I feel? Do you feel, you know? And he shared yes, and I said, how did you possibly become this? And he shared with me a few things, but one of the main things he had shared with me is a physical experience he had gone through that was extremely difficult for him. <br>He had had some kind of chronic health condition, some kind of painful, long-term physical ailment that he had to deal with, and the way that he met it allowed a refinement of his being. That's the only way I could put it. He was so evolved and refined, and because of it, he was just so full of so much joy and awareness and power.<br>And I said, I want to do that. I want to do that. I'm going to do that. I was so fired up and just so inspired, and I remember him communicating, not blowing me off, but kind of like, yeah, that's what they all say. And I was persistent. I was like, no, I'm gonna do that. And I remember him communicating, it's hard in a way you've never known. And I was like, I don't care what it is. I'll do anything to do that, to be this. So, he said, okay, go talk to your guides.<br><br><br>So, I remember, okay, so then there's a big break. I remember that I live, I had many experiences, and I remember finding this being later and sharing with him, see, I'm going through this process like I said I would, and he was encouraging.<br>And so then, okay, so then there's a big break, and the majority of what I remember is somewhat immediately preceding this life, where okay, so I had some experiences, and I'd taken a very long break at this point, and I remember being in a state. It was kind of like a waiting state, but not waiting. Waiting's not the right word. I was active in other ways, and I remember this guy coming to me over and over and over again, like, are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet? Just kind of pinging me every so often and just reminding me of my own intention.<br>And eventually, I said, okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to go back. And I remember meeting with this guy and reviewing what I can only describe as like my state, like who I was, who I had been, and when I did that, it was obvious the thing that I needed to—I don't like the words "work on," but work on—the thing I needed to experience to be in order to grow and evolve past what had been a very low vibrational fear that I'd experienced in a previous experience.<br>And in that previous experience, I had succumbed to a fear vibration that was very low, and it caused me to be a very twisted and harmful person in that experience, and I had caused a great deal of harm to other people. And after that experience, I was kind of—I don't like the word "stunt," but I was surprised at how deep this fear was in myself. So, when I reviewed this with him, it was obvious that I needed to go and integrate this fear and evolve through the sphere.<br><br><br>And I knew that if I could do so, the opportunity for expansion would be unspeakably beautiful and powerful. But I also knew that it was going to be ridiculously hard. So, I remember asking the guide like, well, has it ever been done in all of creation? Has any other being ever done something this extreme in this kind of way? And I was told yes, and you have all time. I knew I had all time. Like, time was given to you to do so, like all time. And I knew that well, if it's possible within all that is to do it, then I will do it. I just had great confidence that I will do it because I knew that by doing it, I would be not only expanding personally, but I would be serving the whole. I would be performing a powerful, valuable service, a creative service, by integrating this experience and doing this.<br>Okay, so they brought me a life. So, I set that intention, and then they brought me a life that was perfect for this intention, and I reviewed this life, and I accepted this life. And I remember accepting the veil, which is just a word that means like the—so when we, at least for me, when I came to incarnate, when it came to be physical, I had—so it's like this huge dive where all the knowing that you have—because we come from a place of total knowing where all knowledge is available to us, and everything is connected, and we know our connection with all things, and we also know our oneness with all things—so the veil for me was a feeling of plummeting and vibration down low, low, low, so low, even lower, low, low, keep going lower, turn down lower, now lower, lower, lower.<br>And in that process, losing my awareness, my knowledge, like my connection with all the knowing that existed, and also suddenly feeling very separate and very alone and very dense and very like in the dark. And just that experience alone was so exciting because I have this feeling that every life has its own vibrational place, like that you that is like—I don't know how to describe it, but it's like a vibrational destination. And when I reached the destination for this life, this lowness of vibration was so extreme that I was like, this is ridiculous. This is so low. This is so dark. What am I doing? I am not doing this.<br><br><br>So, I decided to summon my strength and fight my way out. I was like, nope, I'm changing my mind. I'm not doing this. And I fought my way out, and when I did it successfully, because now I suddenly was back on the other side, but I had a life review because I had inadvertently—now I know it's inadvertent, at the time my exit was intentional—but I had killed the fetus. I killed the body that was to be mine. And so, in this life review, I saw that my decision to do that, my fear, my fear response to that sensation and that vibration, my fear caused me to basically heap difficulty on the shoulders of the poor mother who would have been my mother.<br>And I saw that not only she was affected, but hundreds of other people that would have a more difficult time because of how the mother had been affected by me. And I mean, I had all these great intentions going in, like I had really good intentions, and so I couldn't believe that I had done that. So, I knew I still wanted to meet this fear, but I knew I would have to try again.<br>So, I spent some time in between this previous experience I just described and my current life now practicing accepting the veil and surrendering to it basically so that I wouldn't do the same thing again that I had done the first time. And after a while, they brought me this life. Okay, so now this life was not as optimal as that one would have been. It was still quite good, but it wasn't perfect. But it was good. It was good enough. It was good and had a lot of opportunity in it.<br>And so, I reviewed what I can only describe as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities all instantaneously. I reviewed all of the probabilities of what was likely to happen or could happen in this life, like not from an event standpoint, but like how it would feel to be it and what it would be like to be the person going through this and what was likely, what was not likely. And I knew that the life had a certain energetic trajectory that was very extreme in one direction, and I knew that there was a trauma likely in my 20s that would crush me and cause me to be traumatized and that would allow me to re-experience this fear and to engage this fear.<br>And I was very excited, very, very excited to do that. I mean, from this side, being here, being Christian, having gone through this trauma that did happen in my 20s, of course, it's a—I have a different perspective, but at that time, my perspective was so much excitement. And I knew that the opportunity of this was absolutely incredible, and I knew that the opportunity to be given, like just being given the opportunity to be human, was the most incredible gift. It was just like being given the most precious gift in the universe, like, here, you can, this can be you. And I was like, oh my goodness, because there's only so many opportunities, there's only so many character slots or something like so many people, and I was given a chance, and it was just, I was so honored and so excited.<br><br><br>Okay, so then, they okay, so then I was with these beings immediately before this incarnation where that I can only describe as technicians or like tinkerers, beings who are like technical in nature, and somehow they do this thing where they like apply the veil of the—they apply that life to you like I don't know how to describe—they do this thing that like makes everything fit. And then I remember being with them and like being—I could describe it as a chamber, but like a place where I was ready to do the dive, and they asked me one last time, are you sure? Are you ready? Because once you say yes, you're in. Once you say yes, you're right, you're strapped in, you're in for the ride.<br>And I said yes, and then I remember the veil coming over me once again, and my vibration plummeting lower and lower and lower once again, and my knowing being cut off, and suddenly being alone and in the dark and having no contact, no like intellectual context. There was just me, and I don't know how to describe it, and I was holding on and holding on, holding on because I knew that I just had to basically not fight the veil, and it would work. So, I was just like, just don't fight, let the life take hold. And so, I did that, and eventually, I remember sending like a little ping back to the technicians like, did it take? And then sending one message back, yes, like it worked, and being excited about that.<br>Okay, so I was there for a while in the womb, and then eventually I said, you know what, I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this. This is so ridiculous. This is so dark. This is so constraining. I am not doing this. So, and this moment's very personal, but take your time. It's just emotional because it's what we really are. I remember the spirit of God coming to me and sharing like showing me the universe and the churning of the stars and the love, and I knew, and it said to me, this is still what you are. You can never not be this.<br><br><br>I feel sad because I miss home so bad. I just want to miss that state of being. I'm not saying anything against this experience. It's wonderful. It's a great opportunity, and I love being here, but it's in the ways that I do. But anyway, at that moment, it was so calming to know, oh, because it was like I was resisting my like who I had become. It was like I lost everything I was. That's what it felt like.<br>The veil felt like losing everything that I was, and it was like God coming and saying no, you're still that. So, it calmed me, and I kind of settled down into the simple existence of being in the womb. I remember being there for a while, and then I remember the day that I was born, and I remember the shock of being born. I remember being like just basically like a sensory overload, like light and sound and touching and temperature.<br>But I had no context. You know, I had no understanding at all. I didn't know what was happening. All I knew that something was happening. There's all these lights, and there's cold, and there's touching, and then oh my gosh, like something really extreme is happening, and there's these beings. I knew that like these people that I could see the faces, I knew they were beings. <br>I didn't know what, and I was like, who are these beings that are taking care of me? And I have one visual memory of that day. I remember the room. I remember the layout where the bed was and where the window was and where the heating grate was, where the doctor was standing. I remember just being in awe and being like super curious, like super intensely curious, like what is this place? Where am I? And that was it.<br>For a couple of years, I have some other just sporadic weak memories from being a baby. I remember being in the crib, and I remember wearing a diaper. But then as I got older, I used to draw upon these memories, and I remember used to remember thinking like everybody must know that we're just visiting, and I assumed certain things that were true in my in the higher states were true here. Like for example, I mentioned this in the other video, but I remember expecting that we could feel each other's emotions here because that's how it is in other systems. You can just share feelings. This is very normal. It's very natural to do that here. The separation is pretty extreme.<br><br><br>Well, I remember being in a diaper, and my parents had this neighbor friend over to the house, and I remember this record being on the record player. My father was playing this music, and I remember telling the neighbor friend, watch me dance, and shaking my little tush in my diaper at the couch and feeling super funky, and the woman just like walked away unimpressed, and it stunned me because I was like, she can't feel what I'm feeling. Like, what place is this that we can't feel each other's emotions? What is going on? It was so like I was shocked. I feel like I'm still kind of dealing with that actually. My body's 40 years old, but I feel like every day I'm just like, what's going on with this place? Like, what's going on on Earth?<br>But anyway, so that's a very quick summary. I feel like sometimes I have moments when I feel curiosity like, oh, what about like such and such, and there's often times the veil is still very firmly in place over me. Thank—I'm very thankful for that actually because I feel like this memory is only made it's a bit—it's not only and introduces a great challenge because the contrast is so extreme to be here and have some awareness of where we are.<br><br><br>So, sometimes I'm curious, and I kind of add, and I get this like, no, you don't need to know that. You don't need to see that. That's fine, and I'm okay with that because I've really come to terms with basically just allowing what is here. I mean, in my 20s, after this traumatic experience, I was traumatized. I had post-traumatic stress disorder for years, went through years of counseling, and I to a very large part have healed that. I no longer have any issue picturing the event or beforehand that caused me the trauma. I'm very open with it because I've come to face the fear, and I'm doing it.<br>And I think that's actually in part potentially why some of the memories come because—and actually, well, it didn't come back to me until after I had done the majority of this healing—but it does inspire me because I remember my own intention. I remember like how I can help at least in this one way to hopefully succeed in what I've come—what a story.<br>Yeah, we had one question that came in from Camille just after, do you have any sense of what the time frame was between the life which you jumped out of to this life? No, I have no sense at all. I don't even know if it was human, to be honest. I assume it was, but I don't know that. Time is very different on that side. Linear time is a construction, so I can't possibly speak to when that might have been.<br><br><br>What I found really interesting, Christian, if we backtracked a bit to when you were speaking to that being that you just thought was amazing, like their essence and their energy was just amazing to you, and they explained to you it's because they had been through some lifetimes where they had to go through healing, yeah, which refined—I don't know if I'm saying this correctly—but really refined who they were, and I love that part of your story because to me, when you loop it back to the intent of this show and our audience is a lot of people who have been through experiences related to religion and so on in their hardships, and they can get stuck in that victim mentality.<br>And I love the lesson here that what we go through and what we heal from is only serving to refine who we really are at our core. Like, that's a beautiful lesson, and I think it's important to say that. I agree 100%, and I think it's important to say that who we really are at our core is already love and peace and joy. The being that we are, you, whoever you are listening, you are a creative, powerful, loved being. That is who you are. You are a part of all. You're a part of God, for lack of a better word, and it's very strange that we live in a place where not only don't we remember, but then we work very hard to teach each other otherwise.<br><br><br>You know, we have fear that we're taught. Like, I'm not—so I was raised Lutheran, and I guess I was lucky because I wasn't as drilled into my head as it probably could have been, but I took it very seriously, and I definitely saw the world through a religious lens for probably 20 years. I was very active in the church. In fact, I was very close to going to seminary and becoming a pastor, and so I came from that, and it took an awful lot of bravery and humility, at least I felt that way, when I eventually discovered that a lot of what I believed was not as accurate as it could be next to the love, like the freedom that is the truth. You know, the truth is so freeing and so full of love and joy. Anything less is doing a disservice to who we really are.<br>So, there's a bit of a tangent, but I just want to say that because we often try to frame who we are within a religious context, and it's very difficult to do that. Yeah, it is difficult. The other part of your story that I think was really, really valuable for people listening is you described in great detail how your choices for this lifetime and the other lifetimes that you chose were set up in such a way to fulfill your path and your intention for being here. And the reason I find that such a great point is because anything we've gone through, especially in the context of religion, we chose this because we wanted to learn certain things.<br>And again, like I'm always such a proponent of getting out of the victim mentality instead of this happened to me, we chose this, you know, and are we going to honor the path that we chose? Yes, we choose the context that we come into, yes, and that context is known in great detail, at least it was for me, and that context for many people includes a religious context. Yeah, and so you, so okay, so if you think of consciousness as being first and fundamental, okay, what we are is consciousness, spirit, yes, so then that, so then how do you deal with as a free will because you know we have and we always have the ability to choose within our context.<br>We have a—what Tom Campbell calls a decision space. You know, we have a free will awareness that free will we get to use within a context. So, as consciousness coming into a context of religion, so here now you have a context where you are taught a certain belief system. So, just like everything else in life, how do you deal with that? What do you do with that belief system that now you have stepped into, and there is actually a profound opportunity because if you are taught, for instance, you are sinful and you are really screwed if you don't believe the right thing and do the right thing, okay, you're super screwed, not just a little screwed, you're going to hell, it's bad.<br>Okay, so you're so if you're taught that framework, how do you deal with that? What would that be like? Well, well here we are, you know, experiencing exactly what that is. Yeah, to be that, and it's not easy to make the decision to step—I'm not speaking against religion in the slightest because there's a great—there is a—the spirit works through all forms, including religious forms. There is no context that spirit doesn't work through in one way or another. But also, then if you're in a religious context where you have been taught certain ideas that might be victim ideas or fear-based ideas, can you make the choice to step past that? Like, wow, like, what? How hard is that? It's hard. It's very hard.<br>Like, I have so much respect for you guys and for everyone who is able to take that personal ownership and make that step because I was a part of that too. It's not easy. It's really, really not easy because when it feels like when the answers are all handed to you in some way, that's easier. You know, it's not easy to say, wow, I really need to change and grow and take personal ownership. Personal ownership is hard, you know, and that so, but we have the opportunity to do that here.<br><br><br>So, anyway, to speak to your original point, yes, we do choose our context, absolutely, even difficult context. I know that's so hard for the human ego. It is, you know, we don't like to think, I would not, I would never sign up for this. The thing is, the soul is so free and so powerful and so good and like just so powerful and good and free and full of love and immortality that the opportunity to know the extremes of duality offer extreme opportunities, and we are so bold as to even come and do—can we come even here and be loving? Can we come even here and love each other and help each other and work past our own fears? Can we?<br>It's a good point, and here we are, and guess what, this moment, this day is the opportunity. Like, you can't affect what feels like the past. It's actually all now, but it feels like the past. You can't affect that right now, but now all the power is right now, and so today is the day. Like, you don't have to move mountains. You just have to meet your experience the best you can with openness, love, personal ownership, be there for the person next to you, meet your own fears, do what you can in this moment. The small stuff is the big stuff. That's what we come to do. That is success, and there's so much power involved with that, and it's like this is the opportunity we've all come so far.<br>You know, we've all lived a long life. Not one person listening today hasn't gone through incredible suffering of some kind. I mean, everybody here deals with crazy hardships in whatever form, some more extreme than others, but everybody has their really tough times. But here we are today, and I mean, you're just here to say this. This is the opportunity. <br>This moment, this day, what you do with this, what you do with your walk from if it be religion or stepping past abuse, finding your power after you've been taught that you're powerless, finding the love that you are worthy of and that you are when you've been taught you're not worthy of love, you are free to do that.<br>I feel like the words you just said were so profound, especially when you said the small stuff is the big stuff. Do you think that you were—I'm gonna say gifted with this knowledge of remembering, but you've also pointed out that we all can do it, but first, do you think that you are gifted with that so that you can give these words of encouragement and maybe reach a small number of people, a large number of people, and help them on their way? Like, why do you think that you have this, and then I guess the secondary question is, why do you have this and we don't, and how can we?<br><br><br>Okay, so first of all, I'm in no way special at all, and I don't know if I have some kind of—I don't know if my pre-birth memory did not include anything about being, you know, being spreading this information. I don't know. I do remember, however, asking to have a small bit of memory this time. I remember asking, is it okay if I just don't forget? I don't want to forget everything this time. Like, I remember being kind of like feisty about it like, I don't want to forget every single thing. I want to have just a tiny, tiny, tiny little bit of memory. Can I do that? And they said yes, but it will make the journey much more difficult.<br>And I knew that having even that greater difficulty was greater contrast, which was greater opportunity for growth. Like, I knew even that would allow this to be even more growth could be possible for me. Now, I feel I do feel called to speak to people, not because I have some knowledge. In fact, I don't have any special thing. Like, everything I'm talking, so every one of us is what we are, and actually, I don't mean this in a negative way, but it seems almost a little comical to me that such powerful spiritual people don't—when they when we don't remember, like it's kind of like a big joke. I don't mean it in a negative way, but it's something, it's a little funny that we've all forgotten, but that is the nature of Earth. This is the place where you come, you forget everything that you are.<br>You go super, super, super, super deep into being human, being biological, having to eat and do all that stuff, but who you really are is always, always spirit, always consciousness. You're always you, and just because you're veiled, that doesn't make you any less you ultimately. And so, I'm simply honored to take the risk of saying that. I say the risk because I know I put myself out there. You know, this is not mainstream awareness stuff we're talking about here, but I think it is very important that we remind each other because we've all made some kind of similar choice, and we all are immortal spirits, every one of us.<br><br><br>Well, I love the reminder, and I have two philosophical questions, and I can also hear myself echo, so I hope that goes away. But Bruce, you had some questions that you were going to ask on behalf of some of our listeners. Yeah, I got a previous question and just talked. The question was asking to talk a little bit about prayer and in a post-religious life, what role does prayer play? Yeah, I still pray every day. I'll put it that way. I don't feel—okay, so consciousness is what is real. What's happening is consciousness, and what does it do? It intends. It makes choices. That's like the fundamental thing that's happening in this reality system and everywhere else. There's awareness. There's spirit, consciousness itself, and you're engaging a context, and you're making choices.<br>And the fundamental movement of spirit is that we use the word intent, so it's like why are you making—like what is behind making your choices? Like, what are you why are you making the choices you're making? What is your actual intention? That intention is super important and powerful. It's an active ingredient. It's like the active movement of what is being this moving. And so, why do I say that in context of prayer? Because prayer is a setting of intention. It is setting your intention back toward source, towards God, toward the divine, or whatever form you use to do that, and intending whatever you're intending, whether it be a loving intention for another person or a thankful intention, whatever, and that intention is powerful.<br>So, whether you put the word prayer on it or not is not the active ingredient. The active ingredient is your consciousness focusing and intending to connect with who you really are and with God. I still pray every day. I often speak out loud when I pray, and other times when I've been meditating, I feel no need for words, and I simply am a part of that which is, and it is beautiful, and that itself is kind of like prayer. It doesn't need a new statement, but I'll also allow myself to be if I'm physically oriented today. You know, if I feel very physical and I'm wrapped up in the physical context of the play that we're in, that's okay. I will pray out loud, and I do that commonly. It does have effect and power commensurate to the intention that is being wielded.<br><br><br>The other thing is you talk a lot about meditation. Yeah, and when you typically meditate, are you trying to go into a nothingness state, or how do you meditate? Is this curious? Yeah, it's funny because you would think that you could just like say, oh, this is meditation, but there's not really any good words for that either because okay, so the human personality likes to think in form. We like to think in things and objects and actions, so we like to know, okay, meditation, what action is that? Well, I can give you the action that I start with, that ultimately it's not about an action. It's ultimately what it is. It's a movement of consciousness back to itself without having to be caught up in form, which means thoughts.<br>So, how I typically start meditating is personally, I will imagine a shape in my mind like a square or a triangle, and I will simply draw my awareness along the shape and keep my attention there, my whole body's attention as focused as I can, and if thoughts come, that's okay. As soon as I realize I'm thinking, I go back, and if you do that commonly every day and you allow yourself to fully experience—you have to be fully present with the experience. It's not about performing an action in your mind so much as it is a movement of intention, like I said, and if you do that enough, then I like the metaphor of it's like putting a stick in the river.<br>Or I don't know if you if you were like when I was a kid, I used to play in the pools with my friends, and we would make a whirlpool in a pool, and the water would get moving, and then there'd be always water momentum. Thinking is like that. So, we think all day long every day. I'm this person. I gotta do this. I gotta pay these bills. I'm like, gosh, what's going wrong? My this person doesn't like me. Who am I? And these thoughts just are constantly arriving, you know, and then we don't even realize that we actually set them into motion by buying into the importance of these various things. So, the thoughts are actually arriving to service. We set that momentum in motion.<br>And so, meditation is like taking time to completely allow yourself to focus on one neutral thing and not focus on those many thoughts, and you don't slow down the thought yourself. It's just that the thought momentum slows on its own because it's like hitting the stick. You know, it's just a great—it's very gradual, but like all these spiritual topics, it's not a quick fix. We live in a quick-fix society. Spirit doesn't do quick fixes. We do rich, deep, and dirty. You know, we do everything we can. So, meditation is like that, and so it's very helpful to not judge yourself. Just set aside 40 minutes a day and then just do this for like half a year really before you even judge at all is it helpful. Just allow yourself to do it because what happens is when you do this, you're basically using your intention to give yourself permission to not focus on all these thoughts.<br>And eventually, the thought momentum slows, and eventually, not too soon, but eventually, you can drop the object of focus, and you can just experience exactly what is, what you're calling what your living awareness of the present moment, what that awareness is. You just experience it, and larger parts of yourself rise up on their own. That's how I'd experience it. I don't—I can't go get that, and then when it rises up, it's like profound peace and joy, and then as soon as it happens, the ego's like, oh, I gotta go grab that. That was great. How do I get that back? That's not how it works. You can't go grab it. It's because it arises because it's what you already are when you're not wrapped up in the forms that are so stimulating.<br><br><br>Wow, every time you talk, I've got like a hundred things going off in my head about things we can't talk about here, but I would love to delve in. Like, you are such a deep well of knowledge and wisdom, and we really thank you. I appreciate you saying that. I really feel very much a fool and a weak student of life honestly. I'm in the muck. So, I don't know what that makes the rest of us. I appreciate your time, but actually, it's not me because there's no me. Like, there's not really a Christian. There's my awareness knowing this stuff.<br>So, there's one question that we always like to ask our guests, and that is if you were going to give any advice to people who are going through the emotional turmoil of leaving or thinking of leaving or unraveling religion, what would your advice be to them? I think that the most important thing I could possibly say is that you're loved. Whoever you are, you are completely and utterly loved and accepted. You are accepted the way you are right now, like with all the dirty, all the whatever. Like, you think God doesn't know? I mean, you think all that is doesn't see and doesn't know you? No, it's all known. So, you are accepted as you are, and you are loved.<br>It's beautiful, and so if that's true, why can you not allow yourself to know that and feel yourself? It is true. It's just that we've been so conditioned. This is the place of conditioning. You know, in the religious context, it's a conditioning, but it's also one that I mean like all form. We buy into it once we bind to it. We have a hard time finding our way out. That's the nature of being human. Yep, you probably had some questions. <br><br><br>Yeah, you mentioned when you were before you incarnated that you were still in spirit, and you realized that there was this one fear that it was obvious to you that you hadn't fully integrated it yet. Did that unintegrated fear that you're confronting right now in this life, did it have an effect on you in your spirit form? Like, did you even notice it, or was it so far away that you're like, oh yeah, I'll clean that mess up later?<br>That's a very interesting question to try to speak about with language. I can simply say that okay, so from that side, you could be you. So, you can see who you are. So, even as you are who you are, you also simultaneously are completely and totally aware of the unconditional love that is the truth and the freedom of your nature that is the truth. So, it's okay that you are not perfect. I don't even like to use that word because we're also perfect in a different way. It's okay that you are the being that you are, and you know it. You just—it's almost so it's a matter of fact, but all wisdom is also a part of it too because the wisdom is also like you also have to learn through experience why it's even important. You know, I mean like you—I don't know, it's hard to explain. The wisdom carries over.<br>The quality of being carries over because that quality, it's just that quality. So, that the person that you are is then but within a much greater context where you know your connection, and you have access to all knowledge, but you're still you. You see, you're still you, and but you can see who have I been and who am I? In this case, I have this deep fear energy that had bested me, and I was like, wow, like the word karma comes up, and I think karma's misused a lot, but it is karma basically because I had this fear energy that had caused me through me and because of this fear energy, I had caused harm to others. I was responsible for that. No, not was, I am responsible for that now, even though I don't remember that life very well. I remember dying in that life. I don't remember anything else about that life. I'm responsible for that now because that's me.<br>So, it's like, you know, you want from that perspective, you want to even out and expand and grow in all the ways that you can refine towards the love that is native to what we are. Just don't know how to describe. Words are so paltry. I don't know if that speaks to your question. It does. It's very interesting, and it makes me wish I could feel the feelings that you're feeling that you're trying to explain because I'm like, it's in there. It's in there. It's the wisdom. You know, we all know the feelings. We all know the freedom and the joy of being.<br><br><br>Okay, so another question is that you mentioned that when you abandoned ship on the fetus that was going to be the perfect life, you said you could see how much pain and difficulty you had put on that mother and how much more difficult the lives of the people close to her became because of her life being difficult. Now, we come here because it is a difficult experience. So, how do you—I just want to interrupt really quick. I wouldn't say we come here because it's a difficult experience. We come here because the constraints are high. There's a difference. The constraints being high often leads to a difficult experience or is experienced as difficult, but the spirit does not necessarily—nothing is required to be painful or difficult. It's just that the constraints are so extreme.<br>Anyway, what are you gonna say? That's a good correction. I just wondered why making—I guess I'm trying to figure out the question now—like, how did making someone's life more difficult feel like? How is that bad? I guess I'm not saying that. I had so much respect and love for her, for all the players in the game, and I knew that I'd only made their journey harder. Okay, so from that perspective, the players in the game are like superheroes, and actually, there's a great near-death experience I loved by a woman named Amy Call. She said something similar. She said that the non-physical friends see us who are human as like the superheroes because we're willing to engage this extreme experience of high contrast, high duality, high density, high veil, not knowing who we really are. Like, holy cow, separation. That's what we got going on here.<br>And so, I had so much respect for them, and I only wanted the best for them. So, I couldn't believe that I had made their task harder, and they're another task, but their experience harder, and that was not in alignment with what I wanted for them because I love them. We all love each other. I think we really are.<br><br><br>Now, you also have mentioned before that there have been experiences that you've had where you were able to—because you're so aware, like I don't know, this is me pontificating maybe—but because you're so aware of the reasons that you came here now at this point, I feel like you're able to pick up on the energy of other people and sometimes see into the gifts of their state of being while they're here. Do you feel like expanding upon that at all? Yeah, I sometimes do feel that. It depends on where my focus is. If I've been meditating commonly and if I have more non-physical focus, it's quite common for me to experience the energy of other people and to see more of that than like their physical face.<br>When I'm more physically focused, like if I work for two weeks straight and don't have a chance to meditate or something, it's much less so because I've been getting deeper into the physical by staying focused on it. So, I do have some sense, but I try to be very—I see I'm very skeptical too. Like, I know I'm sharing all this really out-there stuff, but I'm very careful about making drawing conclusions, but I do get information sometimes. I sense certain things about people that I very much relate to. I mean, I've met people who I feel are in my soul tribe, you know, my group of souls that I just know really, really well, and I can't help but talk to them. You know, so I do have experiences like that.<br>I've also had some non-physical experiences. So, I occasionally have body experiences, and I've had several times where I've had experiences with someone I know who's alive while my body was asleep in these cases, and then I've been able to confirm with them the next day that we had that interaction. It's like a fun thing I like to try to do. I've had four times I've been able to do that so far, and in those experiences, I have a huge amount of energetic sharing of what's really going on, who we really are. Words are so pathetic. Our normal method of communication is sharing huge volumes of information that's all emotional and full of all perspective, and it's like not misinterpretable like words are so.<br>Anyway, so I always say I only have a tiniest fragment of that sometimes here. I liked the story that you shared of the woman when you were in the gaming store and the sense of her that you experienced. Yeah, the short version of that story is simply that I was in a gaming store playing a game, and an old woman walked in, and I sensed her energy, and I looked over at her, and my jaw just dropped because I felt this incredible power and this goodness in this woman. I was like, I couldn't even play my game for a few seconds because I just wanted to go over to this old lady and be like, do you know who you are? That'd be so super weird. I'm gonna be that weird guy occasionally. That occasionally happens.<br><br><br>Very cool. Are we setting up for time, Bruce? We're about done. Yeah, it's one of those things where you don't want him and let him know. I feel like you know, Christian, I'm not going to stalk you or anything, but I really want to sequester you in a room for like a week. I'll feed you, but everything we want to know is within ourselves, within yourself. You don't need it. You don't need an external, but I'd be happy to as another wilderness adventure or at least to talk, but I just want to encourage everybody that what you seek is within you. You are this. There's a great echo totally quote that I love, and it basically says a true spiritual teacher has nothing to hand you, no new information, no new idea. All they could do is help clear the way so that you can know who you already are.<br>Yeah, so I think that's kind of what we are doing for each other even by loving someone. Actually, you're kind of already doing that even though it's not like intellectual. It's like just loving someone, smiling at somebody is like giving them a little permission to feel like who they are. Anyway, so that's like a form of preaching in a sense. Yeah, I think that—go ahead. Oh, I said if you want to learn more about Christian and some of his blogs that he does online, it's called "A Walk in the Physical dot com," and I posted it in the chat here so everybody can have a copy of that because it's just fascinating to go read those things and just to learn about where his mind is and some of the insights that he has. And so, I would encourage everybody that's watching to go do that because I hear rumors that you may be writing a book too. Is that true? Yeah, I'm basically turning the blog into a book.<br>My intention—this is like super frustrating to try to do this—bold intention to try to take the blog and put it within a framework that's super short, like 10 pages or less of it, what's going on, you know, with like physical reality, what are we doing here, and then I want to have like a FAQ section just so I can try to take a shot at some of the more commonly asked questions. I mean, it feels like stumbling through the dark every time I try to write because it's just there's no words for any of this, but yes, I'm working on it. We'll see. When I'm eventually done, I'm going to make it publicly available. So, nice. Hopefully, you know, when that exists.<br><br><br>Beautiful. Well, I think you were the most anticipated guest we've ever had on the show from the three of us. We were just busting out of our skins wanting to interview you, and we're very humbled that—yeah, I love doing this, and I feel like this group, like I said to you before, is super important. This is super important, this context of helping people in their journey of stepping past if it's a religious context or whatever other context it is. Very important and very powerful stuff.<br>I'll just say that the real change—okay, so we like to think of the change on Earth is like the physical changes are what we care what we want to see. You know, we want to see new governments, we want to see better laws, we want to see the money and all that. You know, we want that. Okay, that stuff all is like last. What's first is consciousness, your consciousness and mine and everybody listening, and what's happening within it. So, the journey that you're going through in your own mind and in your own heart is the real playing field for change.<br>When you face your own fear and grow past it, when you decide to love yourself even when something is telling you otherwise, you decide to love the person next to you, when you decide that you're going to face your own fear and feel your feelings, when you decide that you're willing to do all that, and then Tom Campbell's words, to improve your quality of intent, you know, to try to issue an intent that is of love and not fear, as everyone does that, that is the active change in the world. Don't ever feel like you're powerless. Everyone here is super ridiculously powerful. You just—they're having an experience of being one human out of a few billion of them, and it seems like you're not powerful. Well, you are powerful, and our consciousness is all connected to each other.<br>So, when a group like this comes together, it helps even one person to awaken and know the truth of the freedom and love of their own being. That is powerful stuff. It's like a light going on in the sea of consciousness that gives permission to everybody else to face their crap and wake up too, and that's how the world slowly heals. It's when we heal, when we heal, when we grow up, the world eventually because when we're loving, we bring love to the world. You know, the loving context stuff happens as we grow towards love.<br>Beautifully said. Thank you, Christian. I want to thank you for being on the show today. It's been an honor to have you on the channel, and I'm honored to be here. Thank you. I know I speak from all of us that it's just—you're an amazing soul, and you feel since the first time I heard you talk, I felt connected to the soul in some ways. Thank you, brother. We're all connected at the soul. We're all connected. Anyway, thank you, and we'll say goodbye there, and thank you.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2020/episode-12-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2020/Episode 12 - Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:01:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[#43 Awakening To Healing With Christian Sundberg - Remembering Past Lives]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=rBYlHQzP_cg  <br>3 DEC 2021<br><br><br>And we should be live now.  <br>Hello everybody! I see UFO Mark, I see Sherry, I see Dennis. Hello, good to see you all.  <br>Today I am with Christian Sundberg. Sundberg, yeah. He has a great story, and obviously we're gonna talk about some other things. Still, before we start about that, I want to also mention that on Saturday I will be on Isetti, not live actually, it's pre-recorded with James Gilliland. So for those that are interested in watching, check that out on Saturday.  <br>And without further ado, can somebody give me... actually, oh, there you go. I've got my five, five. So today we're here with Christian Sundberg. Good to see you, thank you so much for coming.  <br>Thank you. Hi.  <br>I've heard, I've watched some interviews with you. I obviously know the whole story. People can find it, but I do want you to explain briefly to people who you are, what your experience is, and we'll go from there.  <br><br><br>Yeah, sure. Thank you so much for having me. I'm going to be brief about my pre-birth experience, as we were discussing. I think it's good to use the time to dive into other topics. But I'll just at least summarize for those who are listening today.  <br>And before I do, I just have to disclaim every time that I try to talk about this, there are just no words that are possible to discuss these topics. Our true nature transcends the entire world of form and duality. So there's no words, which are symbols in form that are based in our local world. There's no words that can possibly even remotely touch the breadth of what we are or the quality of our higher nature. So I just really need to say that up front.  <br>Okay, so to be very brief, I remember a very long time... Okay, so first of all, my body is 41 years old right now. When I was 30, I took up a long-term meditation practice, and I began to spontaneously have pre-birth memory returned to me. And this memory was very normal, very natural, the most natural thing in the world. Wow.  <br>And it was very eye-opening. I also began to have out-of-body experiences, and they were very shocking, very worldview-altering. And I remember you right there because yeah, I didn't hear that before, that it was spontaneous and only when you were 33. And so yeah, oh 30, sorry. But oh my God, so you were not even shocked a little bit?  <br>Wow, no. But it's strange. Okay, so I remember when the memories returned, I remember that I had remembered them before the age of five or six, and I had forgotten them completely. And that's very normal because we are veiled while we're on Earth. That is, our consciousness is under the constraints of being physical, being biological. So the more we focus into the physical world and our identifications with it, our stories, the more we focus into that, the deeper the veil is.  <br>And so that memory that had been with me as a small child, I had no access to that at all. And also, it was important that I didn't because it allowed me to engage in an experience that was very challenging for me, that I needed to experience or wanted to experience, I should say. And that was a very traumatic experience in my 20s.  <br>So yeah, so then when I was 30 and I took up a meditation practice, the memory began to return, and it was very normal. It was like someone had just blown leaves off of the ground or something, and it was just there's grass underneath. Oh yeah. But it's not like... but it's very, very deep and personal and rich, and not like an earthly event or something. It's very just deeply like in the substrate of my being, like who I am. But so very normal, but also very me, very personal, very known. I don't know, it's hard to explain. Very familiar.  <br>So then ancient and yet happening now, and also very familiar. So do you remember exactly how you were born as well and how you came here, like you know what your mission was as well?  <br><br><br>Yeah, so I mean, okay, so I remember before I had had any physical incarnations, being inspired by a being who had... and the quality of this being's nature was so rich and profoundly beautiful that I was inspired to have physical experience as well, even potentially very challenging experience. So it's not getting into the whole story.  <br>The majority of my pre-birth memories are of a time somewhat immediately preceding this life, where I had taken a long break in between lives. And this guide kept coming to me over and over and asking me, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And putting him off for a while, and eventually saying, "Okay, I'm ready to go back."  <br>And then reviewing with this guide my state, like who I am, who had been... like reviewing my... this is really hard to describe or explain, but it's like reviewing my known qualities or something, like the areas of experience that I knew and that I had integrated and mastered, maybe you might even say. And so I hadn't...  <br>Where do you reside while you wait?  <br><br><br>Yeah, so okay, so while we're human, we tend to try to see the entire reality picture from our local vantage point. So while we're on Earth, we grow accustomed to thinking of reality in terms of locations, linear time, discrete location. Yes, so like I'm here and you're there, and we don't feel connected. We feel separate.  <br>Yeah, and then reality to us is a bunch of places. That's what we think reality is comprised of, places. So it's not inaccurate to think or say that. It's just that this experience that we're having here is not a primarily real place. What we're having is an experience of a place. It's more like a virtual experience, having been physical and biological.  <br>And so really, what's happening is your consciousness itself is receiving data, information, sensory information, sight, sound, touch, and you're having thoughts about it, and you're applying meaning to it. And that is your experience of the physical world. You and everybody, we're all having this experience, and it feels like a shared objective world, but it's actually not. It's actually yours and my experience. It's like the Matrix.  <br>It is like the Matrix. There's your experience and my experience and the next person's experience, and we're all having this shared experience, kind of like when you log on to a massive multiplayer online role-playing video game. You know, you sit down on your computer, you log on, everyone goes into this one shared world. Are they really in that world? No, not really.  <br>Right, but in this case, the reason I say that in the context of your question is there is no distance. There is no actual such thing as separation or distance. We are all connected right now. It's just that we've agreed to have the experience of being veiled from all of what we are so that we can have this, we could even say, artificial experience of separation because it has great, incredible potential in it. There's an incredible opportunity being human.  <br><br><br>So we agree to sign up for the constraints so that we can have this very specific experience of this very specific vantage point. So would it be correct if I would take this metaphor because I love metaphors, right? So there's this mouse, he's born in like, say, this little cage where there is, you know, his life village, everybody else, and all that. But outside of that cage, there's so much more, but obviously, the mouse doesn't know.  <br>And so right, is that a bit what it's like then?  <br>Yeah, yeah. The physical universe is a very, very small portion of what is. It's a very defined, highly specific type of experience. We are experiencing a deep state of separation right now that is quite unusual, quite alien and unique. You know, we're experiencing a state where we actually don't know for certain that we are unconditionally loved. We don't remember all the rest of what we are. We don't even know if we're going to survive death.  <br>You know, right? When you just look at the physical, I mean, you know, you see a body die, and wow, that's the end. That's what it looks like on the surface because what you can see doesn't exist right in our concepts, say. But obviously, we are evolving a bit, at least those that wake up, and we know. But we can still see, so it's about trusting it.  <br>I just simply meant that when because we can't see the larger reality systems directly from the human personality's point of view, that is, from this character's point of view, because we can't see it, it makes this reality have an incredible opportunity because we're at such an extreme point of perspective here, feeling this separate and this cut off. Like, we don't feel the unconditional love that exists for us every waking moment here.  <br>Yeah, and that is a very strange thing, actually, in the bigger context. It's a very unique thing to be in that constraint set. Such an unusual advantage to it.  <br>Yes, and what's the advantage? Because now I'm really curious. Okay, so I'll jump into that. Do you... I'll jump into that. We can come back if you'd like to the rest of the story, but I think this is more important to talk about actually because I don't think that sharing my experience is that important. I think it's more important to talk to this very topic.  <br>Well, actually, let me put the video that you did with Buddha at the gas station pump in the description for those that want to watch the whole story from the beginning because he's done so many interviews. I didn't want to repeat and repeat. It would be boring, and we need new information. So there you go. Yeah, okay.  <br>All right, so this is extremely difficult to describe, but there are some pretty good metaphors that we have. So I'll try to speak to your question with some metaphors.  <br><br><br>Okay, so if you were, let's say, on the couch, and I've used this metaphor before, so I apologize if it's a repeat, but let's say you're on your living room couch, and you're watching TV, and you've got like good access to the snacks, you know, and everything is comfortable and wonderful and good, right? Why would you ever voluntarily get up off the couch and say, go outside and go for a run?  <br>You know, why would you ever do that? To experience it, and not only just to experience it, but because you grow in strength, and you grow, you live in a rich and full way. And then when you return to the couch, it's actually comfortable in a way that you may not have been able to appreciate before. You know, because now you know what it's like to be under stress, and you're stronger, and you come back and you sit on the couch like, "Wow, this is a nice couch now."  <br>I mean, this is a very crude metaphor. Well, actually, it's like having a job that is really stressful and annoying and all that, so you actually appreciate your spare time. And so that's kind of what it's like then. It's about appreciation of what you have if you didn't have it. It's something like that.  <br>It's that the entire system of contrast is used by spirit in order to expand what it is and to evolve. So the name of the game of what we're here to do is to grow in love. We're here to grow our beings towards love, and we're here to integrate experience. That's what we're here to do. We're here to have this perspective and make choices while we're here, make choices, and then see how it turns out, and to try to grow who we actually are towards love.  <br>And so if we can do that here, the thing is here the constraints are very high, and especially in certain circumstances, the constraints can be extremely high. And so if we can bring to bear a loving intent here rather than a fear-based intent, there is a profound growth and a profound expansion in what we are.  <br>So to use another metaphor, it's like, let's say you're laying there, and you're totally weightless and free, and then someone comes over and says, "I can put this big heavy weighted blanket on you, and let's see how you can walk with this blanket on." Right? So then you put on this blanket, you stand, you barely move, you know, you stand up, you can barely move, and now you try to perform some physical feat or something with this heavy blanket on you.  <br>That is a little bit like what we're doing here. We accept these incredible constraints. And I mean, the physical world is not bad. There's nothing negative about this experience. In fact, it's a neutral experience. We apply the meaning to it. That's a big part of what we're doing here is we're learning how to deal with our own consciousness, our own tendencies, and our own processes, and how we apply meaning and what meaning we apply to the world. And then we live with that meaning that we apply and the beliefs that we buy into.  <br>And everything that we do with our experience, both externally and internally, we learn from, we grow from. Well, it's like solving a puzzle, but you don't know the pieces.  <br>Yeah, it's a little like that, except the goal is not to rearrange the objects in some way so that now we've got a good world going. Well, not really. The Earth, the physical experience, the entire physical reality is virtual anyway. It's a stage, a play. It's you know, we can move around the props all we like. It's not really that real.  <br>So what is real? What's real is you, your consciousness, and mine. And so the consciousness that knows the experience operates through it. It operates through context, and the way that it does that, if it's more so if it can operate in a way that is more in alignment with its true nature, which is loving, rather than fearful, fear being more in alignment with the illusion of separation, you know, that we don't like it, we respond, we protect only the self, we hurt others, the ego rises up and does whatever it can to protect us.  <br>If we align with that, you know, that is a very painful choice, whereas if even in this extreme set of constraints, even if here, if we can bring love to bear here, you know, bring compassion, kindness, understanding, humility, if we can meet our own fear, if we can own our own place in the world, if we can meet our own pains with acceptance rather than resistance and judgment, you know, every day there's a tremendous number of ways that we choose how to meet reality.  <br>Every day, that choosing how to meet it is what's so powerful because then that is like walking with the heavy blanket on, so to speak, because as we are able to make choices that are more love-based here, we're doing it under a difficult set of circumstances, under a difficult constraint set, and then we really grow, and we really know it, we really expand and evolve in a way that is not, I don't want to say it's not at all possible except by coming physical, but practically speaking, the only way to do it is to be physical and to do it, to actually do it.  <br><br><br>Thanks to your experience, you can actually share that information, which also means that people can shift their focus to what it's really about because, at the end of the day, we are gripped by these heavy blankets, so to speak, in their lives. So that focus goes there to fight it, to try to make it as easy as possible, which always is working against us rather than for us based on what we're focused on.  <br>And because we are focused on that, because we don't have the knowledge of what it would be otherwise, and which is what you teach us with your experience.  <br>Well, we do. Okay, so the thing is, the deeper parts of us always know. So I'm in no way special. There is just a, it's just that the obfuscation of our conscious awareness is a common and almost necessary, typically necessary portion of the constraint set that we agree to experience here.  <br>So if we can make those loving choices, even if we don't know, even if we don't remember, with just what's in front of us, that's very powerful. In fact, I'm telling you, the opportunity to be human and to make choices in our lives here is such a profound opportunity and gift. It is unbelievably such an opportunity.  <br>Every day, every moment, like you know, we get stuck and wrapped up in the pains of our lives and the stresses, and then, "Oh my gosh, I got this big thing going on, I got to worry about that all day." I know, I do too. I get wrapped up in it too. But even in that, can you change the momentum? I like that you mentioned the word focus because focus is a big part of what we're doing here.  <br>What do we focus on, and why? Usually, when we're afraid of something, it's difficult for us to take our focus away from it because we're so afraid. And part of the reason that happens, actually, by the way, this is just a tangent, is because as consciousness, we always seek to integrate all of our experience. So if there's something we're afraid of or we can't handle, it will tend to pop back up because it's asking to be integrated and assimilated.  <br>And so how we choose to respond is very powerful. Yeah, it's all about choice, isn't it? And so it is, even in very small ways. Like, it doesn't have to be a big, huge, "Oh my gosh, I've got to solve this huge problem, I've got to overcome this huge thing." It can sometimes be huge, Earth circumstances, but to the spirit, what matters is the quality of your intent itself, not the scope necessarily of the physical thing you're wielding an intent about.  <br>You know, watering a plant could be the most wonderful thing. In fact, there's a near-death experience I've shared a couple of times, and I'm sorry, I forget the name of this near-death experience, but one gentleman who shared, I think it was a gentleman, I'm sorry, I don't remember if it was a male or female, but they shared that one of the most celebrated moments in their lives was when their family was on a road trip, and they stopped at a rest area, and this person's parents asked them to go down to this river to get a bucket of water.  <br>And they went down and got water, and they were carrying it back to the car, and they saw a dry tree out of the way, so they went a little bit out of their way, even though it was heavy, the water was heavy, it was a little bit uncomfortable for them, but they went over and watered this tree. And then they took the water up to their car, and they never thought about it again. And that single event was one of the most celebrated moments in this person's life.  <br>It wasn't about the scope or the size. It was just that it was loving and selfless. Yeah, and so all of it, like I think so many people get so overwhelmed by the what looks like scope that can't be fixed. You know, the broken world, a broken society, a broken political system, a broken marriage, a broken family situation, you know, a broken body.  <br>Yeah, whatever. This is so interesting. You said you don't need to worry about that. You just need to make a choice how to meet it, what to do with it. I just realized that exactly those little moments, that at that moment you do them rather automatically, you don't think about it, but they stay with you for the rest of your life. And there's many moments they think, "Oh yeah, remember that moment when I did this or that, and God, I wonder how it is with whatever," in this case, the tree, right?  <br>And it's true, those things actually are so memorable. I never thought about it until you actually mentioned it now. It's not just memorable too. There's a couple of other important points as to why that's meaningful. One is, every other being is a part of you. So when you act in love, you're actually loving another part of yourself. So love is just the most natural, wonderful, good way to actualize or manifest experience because it is an alignment with the unity of our true nature.  <br>But the second thing is, our intent itself has an effect. Just the intent, just a thought, every thought, every intention has like a pitch or a vibration. And in certain other states of being, other states of consciousness, you can perceive it. You can hear it, feel it. You can see that the intention itself is like causing a ripple.  <br>So the way that we meet even our own thoughts, the way that we meet the person next to us, what we prioritize this moment, it all matters. It's all very powerful. It doesn't need to be a huge, arduous scope. You know, we build up a lot of momentum in our lives, like huge amounts of momentum. We think the same thoughts for 50 years. You know, we replay the same things. We go through the same habits.  <br>Our body remembers all of our momentum. We have thought momentum. Don't worry about the momentum actually because now, in this moment, is a chance to change the momentum, to pick something else if you wish to, to choose a choice that is more compassionate or understanding or accepting or loving, even with yourself.  <br>Yeah, and one just one other thing that comes to mind as we do that, so you might feel like, "Oh my gosh, how do I possibly choose that in this cacophony of all these thoughts and actions and things going on in my life? What do I do?" Moving in the direction of love feels good. Yes, like our true nature is so full of joy. Our true nature is joy and love.  <br>So you only need to move then in the direction of joy. You know, I'm just thinking, but you should know this. So the whole example with the tree, if you think about it, it's like making neuron connections, right? So the moment you do the action, you are somehow energetically connected to that event, to that situation. And because it's about love, because it's even though it seems so simple, it just stays with you. You're always connected. You made that new neuron path, so to speak, in your life.  <br>And that would actually be the proof that how profound that is because if you think about it from the opposite way, that if it's a negative thing, it also stays with you, but it doesn't have that well of an effect. It doesn't. You drag the heaviness of that energy with you as well.  <br>Wow, I never thought about it this way, but I just realized this, just that little experience is a neural pathway in the positive that you have made.  <br>Yeah, I like that because when we love each other and when we have loving relationships, we do create energetic bridges. Yes, and that energetic bridge is very powerful and survivable. You know, like we tend to think when people die or animals die or we lose whatever that we love, that it's gone, but it's not gone. The love that connected us does still connect us.  <br>There is no distance. There is no... the physical is just a virtual experience, but the consciousnesses of those who are having this experience, which and those consciousnesses are already connected, they're already part of the one ocean anyway. So when they can make a connection of love, that survives, it endures. It is precious, in fact, powerful.  <br>So yeah, I like that. I really like that. So if we do this consciously, I know it's so simple, but it's so profound because if we do this, say every day, and you make all these energetic bridges with the positive, this is how you achieve the knowledge of oneness.  <br>Yeah, oneness is already there. Well, yeah, but I'm not disagreeing. We're born in a veil, right? And so for us, we always need proof of everything. And because we encounter all these heavinesses in our lives, you know, we tend to think, "Yeah, whatever," right? But this is where you've physically, whoa, and within, get the proof. Oh my God, oneness is real.  <br>You know, we know it's already there because we're told, and in your case, you actually have felt it properly, but you know, this is exactly how we have to pray for ourselves, how we can strengthen it, how we can have faith in the fact that it is true.  <br>Yeah, so the distance away from that is the not real thing. It's the non-native thing. So when we act in love and when we align ourselves with love, with joy, with service and creativity, and when we really do that, we immediately take a vibrational step back towards the enduring truth of what we already really are.  <br>The heaviness is not a fundamental thing. The dark, that you could say, the darkness is not real ultimately. It is only a temporary experience because of the distance we've come, and then vibrationally, we buy into these negative perceptions that are not in alignment with the truth. So when we let go of that which is not in alignment with the truth and we align with that which is an act in love and joy and embrace peace and enjoy a sunset or pet a dog, you know, yes, then there is an immediate vibrational return because we never lost it. It's just that now we're no longer tied up in the painful associations with the illusion.  <br>Exactly. Oh wow, this is so profound. It hits me. Obviously, I knew it kind of, but it now just hits me how profound it is, and I'm really grateful for that. So can we go back for a second to your... you mentioned there was a life that you... well, that you decided to come here, and that was the moment that you felt that happiness, and you said, "Yeah, not gonna do that."  <br>Yeah, so the lifetime immediately preceding this one, it would that was a very appropriate lifetime for my intention. My intention was and is to integrate a very specific low vibration, which I can call a fear. This fear, to integrate a fear, a very challenging fear that in the past overcame me, and there was one life experience I had where this fear, my ego got out of control because ego is a response to fear, and I was a not very helpful person.  <br>So now I'm integrating the same very low vibration because there's an incredible opportunity for expansion in that. So in this, anyway, so in his previous life, the life was super appropriate, and I remember accepting the veil.  <br>Okay, so the veil is just a term. This is super hard to describe, but it's like imagine the body of your awareness, the same awareness that you are right now, like you, you know, you, not someone else, you, yeah, so connected and so breathtakingly vast and high vibration and full of joy that you're connected to all knowledge, and you're just and the bliss of being and love is just endless within you.  <br>And going from that place down, down, down, down, down, down, down in vibration, lower, lower, lower, lower, more lower, now you think you're at the bottom, lower, lower, such a low vibration that it's like ridiculous. Just, I mean, I joke about it, but that is how it felt like, "Oh God, that's why I got down into I was in the womb."  <br>And I said, "I'm not doing this. This is not happening. This is so dark. I am not going to tolerate this for a lifetime." Because when you arrive there, that's also when you take on that level of 3D, so to speak. Yeah, I was in this vibrational level of wherever that life was, right? And I responded in fear like right away. I was like, "I don't like this. I'm not doing this."  <br>So I summoned my might, and I smote the veil. I fought my way back out, and that ended that life experience. I inadvertently killed the fetus, and I had a life review for my short, super short life. Okay, so then this, then they brought me this life, and this one was not as perfectly appropriate as the other one would have been, but it was pretty good.  <br>And I reviewed this life in great detail, and I accepted this life, and then I same thing, I accepted the veil, and I plummeted down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down. I can't stress this enough how low this vibration is by comparison. Like, I mean, I kind of laugh about it because it is because when we know our true nature, we know that it's actually a sign of how incredibly creatively powerful we are, okay, that we've come this far.  <br>And that works, seeing what we can do with it here, even here, even in a world of such limitation, even with bodies of such limitation, even in a world where we can't even communicate very well with each other. I mean, we got to throw words around. We, like, the telepathic communication is gone. So there's all sorts of inability to communicate with each other.  <br>Anyway, and fear is just running rampant in many people's lives because the constraints are so extreme. It's just that we have not evolved enough yet to fully integrate everything here, and so many of us are making fear-based choices every day rather than love-based choices. So it's a big mess.  <br>You know, so there was a big mess. So it's like a catch-21, isn't it? I catch-21. I mean, I'm familiar with catch-22. It's catch-21. 22. Sorry, maybe it had like a better meaning. No, same crap. But so you did accept it this time though.  <br>Well, I didn't fight it this time. Okay, but when I arrived, I immediately responded in fear again. And this time, I had this most holy moment in my whole physical journey where I was about to fight my way out again, and the... this is just so beyond language, and I feel like even just putting words on it is like blasphemy because words are just like they're it just doing it such a disservice to use words.  <br>But the great spirit of God, the great source of all, came to me and expanded me back out, showed me everything that I still am, showed me the whole universe. I felt the whole universe in me. I felt our sun, the sun of Earth, churning in me, and it was churning with burning bliss. Wow.  <br>And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." Wow. And that is the most potent, soul-shattering moment for me. But it was so relieving and calming because I thought that I had lost everything that I was. The veil felt like everything that I am was erased, and I did not like that.  <br>But yeah, after being shown this, I'm like, "Oh, I'm still that." So I let go into the simple existence of being in the womb. You know, I just let go, and I was just there, and it was fine. So as long as I didn't fight it, it was okay.  <br>So the reason I share this now is because that is not specific to me. You, you're my sister. You are whoever's listening today. You are my brothers and sisters. We are all a spiritual family, and we have all come a very long way, a very long way vibrationally, not physically. We've come a very long way in our history, in our long human physical lives, to this moment.  <br>And it is amazing. This is an amazing adventure, an amazing journey. And so I just want to remind whoever is listening, you don't need to be afraid. What we really are cannot truly be harmed. We only sign up for the virtual reality experience where we can experience harm or all the multitude of everything that we experience on Earth.  <br>But who we truly are is so perfect and unblemishable and unharmable and free that there is nothing ever to fear. And there is no more important message, I think, than that. And the other main important message is to tell you, you are unconditionally loved. Like, unconditionally, not just this nice general love that exists for everybody, but you, I mean, that's true too, but you specifically are just so deeply celebrated and cherished, and you're so precious.  <br>We've all forgotten that. You know, we're walking around here on Earth, and we're hurting, and everyone's looking for the love that seems to have been lost, and we seek it in everything. We seek it in objects and activities, in people, and in drugs, and in the next job, and the next thing we can do, and the next TV show, and but we never really find the full satisfaction.  <br>Exactly, because it's not in the physical. But then what would you say to people, how to remind themselves of it because you had that brave moment where you were shown that profound love, which others obviously don't because I couldn't remember the first seven years because I got out every single time, but then when I finally accepted at after seven years old to be here, it was like one big homesick feeling.  <br>Yes. Oh my gosh, yes. It took to way in my 40s to finally accept I'm here, and I've got accepted, and that's how long it took. I feel that your answer, your own answer, is very powerful. The okay, and that is acceptance. Okay, because fear, when we're afraid, the ego rises up. That's just the part of us that wants to fix the problem. Now there's a big problem. Now is the big problem. I got to fix it. Yeah, how do I fix it? Well, what can I believe that will make me feel better? What can I own that will make me feel better? What can I do that will, you know, all the games.  <br>There is profound power in actually letting go of everything and fully accepting and feeling everything. Well, even being low vibration, even being bodily, even being in pain, even being whatever. I'm sorry, go ahead.  <br>Well, I was going to say, the problem lies in judging the feeling and becoming the feeling, while the feeling is merely a biological event, which and that's the difficult part. There's two levels: there's a vibrational event, and there's the biological event.  <br>Yeah, all right, so then can you speak on that because it's so hard not to judge it because you know it hurts. Well, no, but it's okay. So I have experiences of extreme neurochemical pain at times, and I used to be very afraid of it, and now I recognize that pain itself, no matter the type of pain, but including the potentially extremely painful neurochemical imbalance pain that can happen, is just a sensation.  <br>The thing is though, what we do then is we take the sensation, and we are real quick to throw a story on it, and usually the story is pretty fear-based, and then we really suffer. You know, it's the story that makes us suffer. It's the resistance and the story that hurts. Now, the pain hurts, but the pain is just a sensation.  <br>And so I find that it's actually very powerful if you drop all the stories, every label, every preconception, every reason why this is a bad thing, and just feel, just know it, just know it all the way. Just bringing the... this is a term I like from Eckhart Tolle, bringing the light of your awareness, or maybe that's Rupert Spira, maybe they both use the term, but I really love this term, the light of your awareness, into that feeling.  <br>And that just means you allow yourself to feel it and be aware of it. You fully allow it. I mean, I came to experience an extreme trauma in my 20s, and I knew even before I came that this body had biological limitations that would make my journey very difficult, and so I experienced that.  <br>But the thing is, that is an incredible opportunity. And so when it arrives, when whatever arrives, whatever arrives, I at least in my own walk, I seek to fully feel and allow all of it without the resistance, without the story. When you were talking about being very homesick, and you know, I feel very much like I relate to when you say there's like a resistance to even being physical.  <br>I mean, I get that. I remember a few years ago, I was standing like as I was going through my awakening journey, maybe I don't know, maybe eight or nine years ago, I was standing at the toilet peeing, and I remember while I was peeing, I remember noticing I was afraid of the sensation of urinating. Okay, because I didn't have control over it.  <br>It was simple. I'm just using it as an example of I recognize, "Oh, I am not okay even with that at the time." So now I realize this is a very deep fear. I seek now to fully be bodily, fully to fully accept this vibration, to surrender to it, not fight it, but allow it.  <br>Oh my God, and there is so much power there because if you can do that here, oh my God, you just hit the nail on the head. It's like I was just thinking about the pain, and it doesn't matter what kind of pain, whether it's physical, mental, it doesn't matter. So we hang a value onto that, which means we judge it, and then usually because it's so uncomfortable, it becomes fear because who wants to be uncomfortable, right?  <br>And so you become fearful of the feeling of uncomfortableness, which then gives a whole different load to it again, which then amplifies the whole thing instead of going the opposite direction and saying, "Okay, this is what it is. I can't do anything about it. I have to let go." And so it is what it is.  <br>And I have to say, I've experienced that this year. You know, I told you about my cat's dying. People know when they die. At a certain point, there was a point that he said, "Oh, it hurts like hell. It hurts, but can I do anything about it? Not really, so I may as well accept what is." Even though the pain is still there, and I have to say that made it like 75 percent less heavy.  <br>Obviously, I fell for the trap again in the past two weeks because it was really heavy, but God, you just remind me again right now how it is done because it's so quickly how we can forget it again to just not judge it because that makes it happen, and not judge ourselves, and not judge ourselves for not being at peace.  <br><br><br>Yeah, you know, so many of us are just so hard on ourselves. Oh yeah, we're doing a pretty darn ambitious creative thing here. I mean, our guides, when they look, I mean, those on the other side, when they look on us, they have a lot of respect and a tremendous amount of respect, and they see the constraints that we're operating within.  <br>So we need to just acknowledge, "Oh wow, I've got some serious constraints here," and it's okay to acknowledge, "Wow, I've just spent 40 years being afraid of something." That's okay. Now, choose something else. Like, you always have the power now, even if there is a lot of past momentum. The universe will respond. Your intent in the present moment always has power.  <br>Yeah, it can't be any other way. So there's never actually a circumstance that is, put this way, there's never a circumstance that is bigger than you, like too big for you. And I say this knowing that because I had post-traumatic stress for a number of years in my 20s after this traumatic event, and it was only after processing and healing that through therapy and a lot of internal work that I did EMDR, I did too, that I had this awakening journey.  <br>Like, I had to really meet all that deep dark stuff and process that stuff. So I'm not making light of it when I say your consciousness is deeper than your deepest crap. Hang on, say that again. Your consciousness is deeper than your deepest crap, your deepest pain that you resist, your deepest fear that you resist, your deepest whatever it is that is totally unacceptable.  <br>You're actually deeper than that. It's just that we get over one, it looks too big to handle, so we put it away. We put it under the rug. We lock it away. We put filled 600 layers of ego on top of it. You know, most of us have some layers of fear that are pretty darn extreme. That's okay.  <br>Yeah, I'm just encouraging that when you're ready, you don't have to be afraid. You can actually go face your own crap. I'm just thinking about our responsibility because we tend not to take that because you know, feelings, I have feelings, can't help it. But we can actually, and so there's this quote that I posted the other day, and it says, "What you're not changing, you're choosing."  <br>And when we get the knowledge of these things, we know that we're choosing. It doesn't matter if we forget about it a little bit, but eventually, this is the whole process, isn't it? Because it's hard work evolving. It's really hard work. Right, it's especially hard when you come to a place like this that's this extreme.  <br>Yeah, like this is like, I think it was Peter Panagar maybe who said it, but I forget who said it, but one of the near-death experiences I love and respect said, "Being human is like an extreme sport." It is. It is. Okay, so here we are like on Mount Everest, and we're like, "Oh my gosh, it's so cold. There's like no air up here. I'm exhausted."  <br>Yeah, you're climbing Mount Everest. Like, it's cold. And then you have to learn to cope while you're planted there. Right, exactly. That's what it is. Well, here we are. Yeah, we learned to cope here. We are, we learned to cope.  <br>Yeah, and as we do that, it's not like just a big hardship. The whole thing is not just a big hardship. As we cope and integrate, yeah, the native joy that we are can explode outward because the native we are natively joy and love. So when we integrate the experience now, there's this growth.  <br>Like, if this is just a dualistic metaphor, and we transcend duality, so don't talk, but like, if you start here at source, you know, you come all the way out here, and now you're like climbing like Mount Everest. Now you're like way out here. So now this is really hard, but if you can integrate this experience, then you energetically and your consciousness expands to here, and there's this profound growth in power and joy and love.  <br>So many of us choose to do the really hard climbs. You know, yeah, none of us want to take many of us are like, "Everest, I want to go to Everest. I want to go back there. You know, I want to try to get to the summit this time." You know, and so often it's the guys who are like, you know, that's a pretty hard climb. It's pretty cold.  <br>You know, some people are like, "I want to try it without gloves." You know, I'm just using a silly metaphor. I'm just saying that we know that the contrast is a potential. It is a valuable potential that is given to us that we can utilize. And so choosing how to meet those circumstances is utilizing the counter pressure of life and the way that it's meant to be.  <br>Like, the counter pressure, like the circumstances of your life, are the counter pressure. It's like if you're laying on a weight bench and you're pushing up weights, you know, do you push up weights because that's just the way life is? No, you just use the counter pressure while you're there. You push it up, and then you put it down, and you don't have to lift weights ever again if you don't want.  <br>You know, we don't have to incarnate if we don't want, but the counter pressure of your circumstance is a huge opportunity. So you might as well lift the weights while you're here. We forget that we had a choice up front, right? That's where the catch-22 comes in because you come here, and then your veil, and you forget that you actually chose it.  <br>Yeah, which is like, it's like the soul takes a small portion of itself, a subset, and allocates it into the human character, and the human character thinks it's all that the self is, but it's not all that the self is. You yourself are much more than the human character. That's just a part of you.  <br>So then, you know, when you choose to come here, do you get to choose any life? Do you get... I mean, I know that you get options, but or do you just get one life that you get to choose? I guess not, but well, I can only share what I know from my own experience because I think it's different for different people.  <br>But in my case, I had an intention, and they brought me a life package that met the intention that was a good match. They, the guides, reviewed the database, so to speak, and said, "This life will work. What do you think about this?" And then I reviewed it in incredible detail, like millions and millions and millions of possibilities of what might unfold, what was likely, what was unlikely, what it would feel like to be this person, to come this far out in the wilderness because I knew that I was going to be going super far out in one direction.  <br>Like, my life path in this life is not a general life. I'm doing one very specific thing to a very extreme degree. That's what I'm doing. Do you see also the amnesia that you are there with since you get to see it, you also know that you're gonna be suffering? Well, you know that there's a potential to suffer.  <br>It's never a requirement to suffer. No, I get that, but obviously, when you're up there, you don't know that you're gonna how it's gonna feel to be completely without the memory. Yes, it's okay. So in my experience, I reviewed what it would be like to be me ahead of time, and I was extremely excited at the opportunity, even though I knew it would probably crush me and traumatize me.  <br>Oh wow, I was extremely excited at the opportunity. Now, the ego doesn't like that. You know, yeah. But the okay, so the soul knows our true nature. It just knows what we actually are, and there it knows there's nothing to fear. And we do know we will be veiled. You know, we do know that we're not going to remember. That's just the name of the game.  <br>But we've also done it well. Not I don't know everybody, but most of us, I believe, probably all of us, have done it many times. Yeah, and so it's not like a new thing. Like, veils are used. The veil is a like you think of like a technology that is additive. It allows an expansion of being through these types of extreme experiences that are only possible through veiling.  <br>And we know that ahead of time. Okay, yeah, so then what like the current situation, you know, we're busy in chaos in the world, and people are literally scrambling to get on top of their strugglings and evolving. You can literally see it right. Everybody is trying to fight their way into that learning process. I think it's more than I've ever seen before.  <br>So what would you say that would help at the moment to give people help, advice, how to cope? Yeah, first, I wouldn't really differentiate a given circumstance too much because I'm just making this comment because you know, a lot of people have asked questions about COVID or political situations or whatever, as if, "Wow, this is true chaos now. Now we've really reached it."  <br>The thing is, Earth, okay, so there's all sorts of context happening on Earth, and we tend to have our fears provoked one way or another. Like, yeah, no matter what the prop that's stimulating the fear, yeah, it's the fear. It's us that's real. It's not really the props that are real.  <br>Okay, so I'm just making that distinction because it's not like we're in some terrible period right now. It's just this is the nature of Earth, and Earth is going through an awakening process. So there is a lot of friction on the surface right now because there are a lot of old ideas and thought patterns that are asking to be challenged in our collective consciousness, and the collective is going through a shift, and that's good.  <br>But meanwhile, yeah, so what can we do? Okay, well, I mean, of course, each person's walk is so unique and individual, but one thing that I think is worth mentioning is that there is nothing to fear and that we can accept our experience.  <br>I don't even necessarily just want to say accept the circumstance. It is accepting circumstance, but really what I'm talking about is what is your story? What is it like in your own mind, in your own life, your own personal story, and where does it hurt? Try to accept there and seek in yourself where your intent is aligned with fear rather than love.  <br>The context stuff is going to be different for everybody. It's always going to change, but how the quality with which you make choices in it is what is powerful and important, and you always have that power. Don't forget that you have power. You know, we tend to give away our power because we think, "Oh, all this that might these people have my power, and this money has my power, and this wreath, everything external has the power, and I don't have any power."  <br>Yeah, you are a powerful creative being. You are a part of source. You are like a piece of God, a fragment of the whole, a drop in the ocean. You have a ton of power. So what stories are you losing yourself in? See if you can locate it and let go of the stories and allow and fully experience and feel everything that is within you.  <br>I find meditation to be very powerful and helpful for this because over the long haul, over the long term, as we meditate, we gain familiarity with what we really are, which is awareness itself, being, being, yeah, exactly. And that which we are not our thoughts tends to fall away.  <br>Yes, and then as that happens, we already are of peace and joy already right now. Conscious that is the nature of consciousness. So as we let go of, we release our death grip on the painful stories, and as we do that, the nature of life rises back up. The nature of life is peace and love and joy, and that is never far away from you, no matter what is going on in the world, no matter what's going on in your life.  <br>That peace and joy of your spirit, that's what you already are right now. It's just that you've lost yourself in the story of the fear and the ego, and that hurts. Oh gosh, yeah, I'm just pointing out because it's not a far step. It's not like you need to go do a hundred things. You just have the power now to go take a step in this direction towards your true self, towards the consciousness that you are beneath the story, beneath thought.  <br>Actually, I experienced it this week. I was so frustrated. I was in so much pain. I felt grief and all that, and I couldn't take it anymore because you know, you're fighting it, and all of a sudden, I came to that point that I said, "Okay, stop it, and just be." And so I just felt it, but I didn't judge it, and all of a sudden, things expanded around me because I didn't judge it.  <br>It also took away so much noise around it that I was just being me with that frustration, whatever I felt, but that was it. And I thought, "Okay, so then all I have to do is just sit through it." But in the meantime, it's like because I would say, I want to say in the meantime, I could look around again, but literally, it's rather that I could feel again around me because now, yes, I was feeling horrible and all that, but because I didn't judge it, I now had the room to...  <br>We cannot call it seeing, is it? Because it's not about the seeing, but rather experiencing that, "Oh, there's me just sitting here on the couch with this awful feeling, but that's not all there is. There is so much more." And so I like what you said about that's not all that there is. There's so much more because when we are thinking a thought or when we're lost in a story, we become unconscious.  <br>Like, we move in the direction of not being alert. We are asleep in the thought. Thinking is like having a little dream. Like, right now, I'm having this little dream that I'm hungry, and I want a sandwich. And that means, "Oh my God, that moment that you're hungry and you want a sandwich, that's you are the being who is hungry and wants a sandwich. You're not the whole. You're the being who wants a sandwich."  <br>So when we let go, it is a move towards alertness. Like meditation, some people like, okay, so in my book, I provide a meditation exercise that really has worked well for me, and it begins with an exercise in thinking and thought to regain one's focus, but ultimately, it's not about a thought.  <br>Meditation is a move towards complete alertness, like awakening, like the most awake, alert, just go see exactly the most alert way, eyes wide open way that you can. What is the present moment? Yeah, now you'll fall asleep back into a thought. "Am I meditating? Is the time up? Did someone just knock on my front door?" That's okay. Go back to knowing the spacious awareness that you are.  <br>There's so much peace and power there. So I like that you said that because really, that's a really good example of how you know we get stuck sometimes. We'll be stuck in the asleepness for a long time. You know, you said it's so brilliant because never ever did I connect that these thoughts, like every single time you judge your feelings and you're busy fighting yourself, you're unconscious.  <br>Yes, it's literally every time you're not being. When you wake up and you're like, "Oh my gosh, I was unconscious. Now I feel bad about myself because I was unconscious." No, you don't have to do that. Yeah, okay, you were unconscious. You didn't know. The vicious circle, isn't it? You go, ego is unconscious.  <br>Oh my God, you know how that's Eckhart Tolle's one of his main messages actually. I really love that about his. Oh yeah, me too. Hugo is unconscious. I never thought about it that way though, although I'm a big fan of Eckhart Tolle. I watched a lot of his lectures, especially the one on the ego was the best ever.  <br>But you know, if he, it's so simple. If we keep that in mind every time we judge and think, yeah, we are unconscious. And yeah, and then so then what happens is we think the next thought is, "Well, then how do I get out of that?" And then we just think about it. We spin our way by being.  <br>Yeah, by being fully. You see, if you can see if you so if that happens, you know, if you're like, "Oh, I don't even know how to start that process," after this, go sit in a room by yourself for five minutes and do nothing. Yeah, if you feel uncomfortable, if you feel uncomfortable, that is that's okay. That's the need of the ego, that's the craving of the stimulation of thought. That's okay.  <br>Just go sit by yourself for five minutes. Yeah, and then after that, you can do whatever you like. I'm saying that because it's like you got to take the time. You have to. We're right now we're in linear time, so we need to take time to actually go do this and just be. But this is nothing you need to do for five minutes exactly, but that's true meditation. You don't have to sit for it. You can literally do it any moment of the day.  <br>Yes, definitely. Wow, you know what? I knew all that, but I never realized I forgot about it. How quickly you can forget about it. Right, yes. Yeah, I'm not gonna judge it, but this is actually what we need to be aware of. Yeah, I mean, now I know it, but next week I can't forget it, but the whole point is that you are aware of it now.  <br>And you know, and that's how you train yourself because that's the hard work where it is. Right, I have a little sticky note above my desk that says, "It is an illusion," and I wrote it when I had just had a non-physical experience where I was not local. I knew that the physical was arising within me. It's not that I was stuck in some body or something, and I really knew it, and I wrote this note for myself.  <br>And there's probably been like 200 times or something I've looked up at that note and went, "Oh yeah, it's an illusion. I forgot," because I keep getting sucked back in too. You know, like I get associated with the human story too. I had that text from Edgar Thomas's book that I had on a sticky note. It says, "You are the captain of your own vessel," and it's not the other way around.  <br>And yes, exactly, it's not right, the other way around, but that's what we literally do 90% of the time is that we let ourselves be driven by our ego. Well, essentially, we are the pilot of our own story, of our own vessel. And so yeah, that's that's, I don't know exactly how he actually wrote it exactly, but I still have it on a sticky note, which you know, I need to get out of there again because you know, it's so profound.  <br>It's so necessary, especially in these days. Right, I see people struggle a lot, that includes myself, but God, this conversation just got me back to where I needed to be. That's wonderful. Yeah, it's helped me also for sure. Right, and so did you have something to add about you were talking about the consciousness of people or was that about this for which topic?  <br><br><br>You said that you wanted to discuss how we are all one and how the topic that I mentioned before we went live. Yeah, yeah, so yeah, this is probably a good topic to close on. So I think it's important to point out that the consciousness, okay, we tend to think of the afterlife and the spiritual as something far away.  <br>You know, it's around some corner somewhere. I can't see it. I hope it's real. You know, I don't see it. What's going on? Okay, I recognize that when we're deeply associated with form and with duality, that that is a nap. Like, we tend to feel that the spiritual may be far away. There couldn't be anything closer to you because your consciousness itself is the playing field of spirit.  <br>It is the spirit, and your consciousness itself is the very thing that is knowing this moment, this conversation, this sound. It's not far. It's closer to you than your own breath. Yes, I just, it's what you are. So I, and then okay, so the reason that I mention that is because this experience of the physical is occurring in and on that consciousness.  <br>You already, you're already there. Your consciousness is already on the other side because you are a part. If you think of your consciousness as the water of the ocean, it's water. Yeah, you're already a part of the whole. I just realized after everything we just discussed that I now understand the concept because it's just our consciousness, our higher self, which we can really easily reach when we are conscious, is that we are already there.  <br>That's what we're always connected to. Oh my God, never ever did I think I would understand the concept of you know, because indeed when you die, transition, I would say, it seems so far away, but we're already there, and I never understood it. I hope others do too by the way because they are so profound.  <br>Yeah, when your body dies, the same awareness that you have is the same. It's just now the constraints go away, and now all of a sudden, it's the same exact... the very in fact, the guide Seth says he has a quote something to the effect of, "Many of you die, and you don't even realize you've died."  <br>Yeah, because the transition is so seamless. However, birth is a very shocking, I mean, you know, incarnation is a very shocking process, and that's what I've described. That's the difficult step. The other step is wonderful. Isn't it that maybe people are just afraid of the process of dying because it's always associated with pain and suffering?  <br>Right, because I never thought of thinking beyond that because literally that so-called suffering or pain is like probably going to the dentist. You know, and you know, you have a bit of a pain or a lot, or you're scared of it because you know, you never know what they're gonna hit, and if you are anesthetized enough, whatever, right?  <br>And that's it, but after you go away from the dentist, it's all over, and everything is good. So what we really focus on with death is that moment. It's the moment that we have to transition, and I guess that we need to shift the focus to what it's really about then.  <br>I feel, and so I have a fear of death. Sure, I'm not not death. I have a fear of the process of having my body go through a dying process. I yearn for the transition. That's not the same, but I'm just saying that I feel that that is a very similar fear to the fear that I've been processing in my life in general overall and through the trauma in my 20s.  <br>And so what is the what do we focus on then? Just the present moment, even if you're dying. Yeah, when you're not dying, your body is just going through a change. You'll be fine. What is the present moment? It's like, how about this? Like, let's say before you go to bed at night, you know, you lay down.  <br>You're not stressed about going to sleep. Sleep's great. Well, I mean, I actually used to be stressed about going to sleep when I was young because I didn't... this is in my teenage years. I remember feeling afraid of letting go of control enough to even fall asleep, which to me sounds so strange now because you know, that's a seems like a different lifetime almost.  <br>But anyway, for most people, when we lay down to go to sleep, we're not afraid. Our consciousness experiences prior to sleep, and then maybe we experience dreams, and then maybe we experience that the next morning is there, but do we ever have a break in awareness?  <br>Yeah, no. Now, there are differences in alertness, biological alertness. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about your awareness itself. Right, have you ever known anything ever that wasn't your own awareness of it? Well, we think we don't. Well, I'm saying we've never... there's not a single person that has ever known anything that wasn't their own awareness of it.  <br>I'm pointing out that awareness is always present. So just like before you go to sleep, you're not afraid of going to sleep. You're just in the moment, and then you're in the next moment, whether it be dreaming or whether you wake up in the morning. Now you're in the next moment. Now you go make your coffee. It's just it's fine.  <br>Death is similar, except now there's a huge relinquishing of constraints. It's like taking off this very, very, very dense suit. Yeah, and you're still you, but now you're like not in a suit. Now it's like... well, I don't think that is actually what anybody is afraid of. What we're really afraid of is the unexpected way of what is going to happen.  <br>So we always look in the future instead of being in the now. Right, so I mean, if somebody falls asleep and dies in their sleep, oh, everybody's like, "Oh, there's a great death," right? But if it's an agonizing long stretch till you get to the point where you die because then you know, you want to die as fast as possible if anything, and then without feeling it, right?  <br>So we're always afraid of the moment before the death, not really the death itself. Right, which is the only thing. Some people may be afraid of the death itself. Yeah, I'm just mentioning that because I think some people may think that there's an oblivion or a destruction. Oh, right, yeah. I'm just mentioning that because that's an idea. You can only have the idea of oblivion.  <br>Yeah, but again, even that is taking expectations. It is attaching yourself to an expectation because that's where everything goes south, right? When we expect things, and you know, and that's where the fear comes in. And so, you know, and that comes often also with religions and stuff because you know, "Oh, there are all these promises," but at the end of the day, you know, somebody asked, "What about losing his spouse?"  <br>I have that dilemma now. You mean like in death more or relationship? Because I'm trying to understand what you mean there in the chat. But I think anything that we are expecting is is the expectation based on fear, which usually it is, right? And so, and that makes it suffering instead of being in the now and just let happen whatever needs to happen.  <br>We don't know that because it's in the future, so whatever happens now, you have control over, which is not easy in this plane of existence. You know, since even after enlightenment, you still have to do your laundry. So you know, you still have to plan ahead of things, and that's where it makes it so complicated is that we are constantly confronted with planning and things, so we automatically plan also what we have no control over.  <br><br><br>Yeah, I only have a few minutes left, but I wanted to ask, did the questioner... what was the question? I just want to see if there's anything I could do. Yeah, "What about losing a spouse? I have that dilemma now." Is there a dilemma that this person's spouse is in the process of passing?  <br>I think it has to do with the separation from another person in general. I guess I think it doesn't really matter whether it's true death or... okay, but it doesn't say. Okay, well, the thing is, we think that the physical is what is most real. So when we see something, when a person's physical presence is now absent from us, whether it be by breakup or death, we feel a profound loss because now we're not able to interact in the way that we know with that person.  <br>But what is real has not been lost and cannot be lost. The loving connection between each spirit remains, and the spirits remain. The spirit is what's real. That person's spirit remains. Your spirit remains. That which is real remains. It can't be lost. The forms can change. The play can change.  <br>And then when it changes, it's okay to experience deeply the emotions that arise. You know, I'm not at all saying we should not pay heed to the mourning. It's just that the true substance has not been lost. The only thing that is lost is the temporary physical expression.  <br>Yeah, I like... I'll just, this is uh, this may sound unrelated, but it's just kind of real. I think maybe it's kind of a similar idea. So where is the five-year-old me? Well, you know, that body's gone now. Every cell in it's probably been replaced by now. You know, there are so those cells are all dead and gone.  <br>Where is the fiber? What happened? Well, I'm still here. I'm still me. The I that knows this experience of having a 41-year-old body is the same I that knew a five-year-old. My associations have changed. My story has changed. I've changed. I've grown, but I, but the body, like I don't really miss it even because what I am is here now.  <br>I am consciousness. I'm just pointing that out because you know, there's always a process of change and death happening, but we are always present anyway. And the person that we love is always present anyway, even if their body is gone. They can be with us right now. It doesn't... they can... we can have a tangible relationship with them in a way that what we would consider to be non-physical, but is still a very real, tangible relationship.  <br>That's possible. Yeah, yeah, we attach to the parts that you know, we consider as lost. Yeah, you know, but so then how would you deal with that because like now I miss my cats. I want to touch them. I want, but I can't. I don't have control over that. They're gone, period. So it's about accepting, right?  <br>And it's about accepting and fully feeling. Yeah, and discovering how you are meeting the moment. It's okay to feel what you feel. Yeah, and it's okay to meet it with openness and to meet yourself with compassion and you know, it's not about rejecting. This is not about setting up a new boundary.  <br>When we make statements like this, it's not about saying, "Okay, now don't mourn because you didn't really lose anything. Don't worry about that." Yeah, I'm not even saying that. I'm what I mean is that which is truly real, enduring, cannot die. Yeah, but as the forms shift and change, and we feel emotion, it's very good to feel our emotion and to really acknowledge what we feel and what we know.  <br>Like, if you feel something, you feel it. Like, it's a part of your experience, so it's worth honoring it and knowing it, and then seeing what you do with it. You know, what choice will you make from it, with it, to it? You know, well, Barcelonette is saying, "Never underestimate the power of a woman. My whole life, they had let my life's journey in such a positive way, missing my wife every day."  <br>So yeah, and you know, it really does... whatever I guess we because you know, I have that with my cats, and I guess something that somebody told me is, you know, look back at it with love, with the memory of it, and cherish that the memories and look back at it with love, and really, that's all we can do.  <br>The deep mourning is a sign and reflection of the deep love. The mourning is because we love, and the love can't die. The connection came well. I never thought the mourning is just like it shows us that we love, but that which we truly love can't die.  <br>I mean, I know that it can seem just cruel in such a cruel way persistent here in the physical, and now this person that we loved is physically gone, and it's like, I'm not judging us when I say that our egos rage in response and go, "What? This is horrible and terrifying, and I don't accept this."  <br>But you have a choice. Yeah, how to meet even that pain, even that mourning, and that love does not die. That connection remains. The relationship is still there, and after the physical is passed, you will still have that relationship. Like, you can't lose it. The things that you love, you get to keep.  <br>Let's see that way. Like, the physical will pass. You don't keep your shirt. You don't keep your money. You don't keep your body or your hair. That stuff's all form, but what you keep is your love, your very nature.  <br>But we attach to the physical of it, right? And that's where the hurt comes in. But yeah, I mean, I guess, but even the physical of it can be experienced again if you like. It's just... I'm just saying that did you say how?  <br>Yeah, yeah, well, because we are thought, okay, so we're creative beings, and in thought-responsive reality systems, we can create all sorts of environments if we want. We can... well, you can't bring that person back. No, but I'm saying you can in a astral environment, whatever word you want to use, go to a non-physical environment with that being.  <br>The two of you can have a picnic again if you'd like. That's no problem. Well, you need to know how to do that though. Well, I just mean I don't mean necessarily right now. Yeah, right now you are dealing with the physical character. You actually can do it now technically. It's just we get deeply associated with the human story, so it's difficult to access those higher portions of ourselves.  <br>It is possible to have an out-of-body experience and to interact in a very, very, very real, tangible, touchable way. I mean, those realities are actually even more real, more lucid, and colorful and real than even this. I'm just pointing out that even like, you know, we're saying we mourn the loss of the physical, but it's not like you can't ever even enjoy that again. You can.  <br>It's impossible. Yeah, well, you know, and on that note, I love that we had that. It was such a great, profound conversation, and it helped me a lot, and I hope a lot of other people as well. And where can people find you?  <br>Yeah, so my website is awalkinthephysical.com. I just want to point out that my book is available for free if anyone's interested. It's on my website. The book page, the third link down, is a link to the Google Books entry. I just think it's important that it's available to everybody. It's not about money. I just want to share the message.  <br>There's some talks and other videos links there, and if anybody would like to email me, I mean, I've been ridiculously busy lately, and I'm going to be starting a new job soon, but my email is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a> I'll definitely try to respond when I can.  <br>Yeah, I have your link in the description where you can find your book, so I assume that's also your page, right? You know, there's a book page on the main page. Yeah, okay. And I also gonna share the video. I do recommend you guys to watch it, and that's an interview where he tells the whole story from his experience on the previous life.  <br>I put it in the chat. I also put it in the description so people can check it out. Definitely recommend it. And thank you so much for being here, and I really hope that I can invite you again because we had such a great conversation, and I think it helped me too for sure.  <br>I just love connecting in this way because I too get sucked into the daily stresses of life, and it's easy to forget who we really are while we're here. You know, and so if we can encourage each other, it's just a wonderful thing. I mean, we're all kind of like walking each other home. I've heard it said before, and I really like that.  <br>You know, and so I really just love that we can have opportunities to just connect in a way that is genuine and about these larger topics that they may seem abstract, but they're not. We're talking about very real things here. Oh gosh, you have no idea how this helps me. Very meaningful. This is very meaningful.  <br>It is so... I will invite you again, and in the next year, I hope that's okay. And I hope everybody enjoyed this conversation, and yeah, check out his interview, check out his book, and also remember, I'm on Isetti with James Gilliland on Saturday, and I will be back on Monday with Jackie Pearson, which will be fun as well.  <br>And I thank you so much, Christian, for coming, and thank you to everybody in the chat and my mods for being there, and thank you, UFO Mark, for your donation. Sorry, I forgot to tell you, but yeah, thank you so much, Christian. Thank you so much. You have a wonderful evening. I'll talk to you soon.  <br>All right, thank you, everybody.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2021/43-awakening-to-healing-with-christian-sundberg-remembering-past-lives.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2021/43 Awakening To Healing With Christian Sundberg - Remembering Past Lives.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:02:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[#77 - Christian Sundberg - Pre-Birth Experience - The Nonduality Podcast]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=_o8rRWhi58Y  <br>29 NOV 2021<br><br><br>The constraints that we agree to adopt and to wear in order to have the physical experience—it's like a huge, huge drop in vibration in the being, in the body of awareness of what one is, to plummet from a place of total knowing, total connectedness, total love, total freedom, down, down, down, down, down, down vibrationally into this point of perspective that was so dense and so firm and dark. It felt so separate, and it felt like all of what I am was erased, like I have lost all of everything that I am.  <br>We're just on a walk, on a journey where we are visiting this place for actually incredible purposes—great, great purposes. The purpose of the expansion of love and joy through the integration of experience, through choice-making in a rich context. This rich context where we've even come so far into separation that we've forgotten that we're connected and that we've forgotten that we're unconditionally loved.  <br>This is still what you are. You can never not be this. We've forgotten what we really are for a while, and that is the nature of the human experience. So we vastly transcend this experience, and there is nothing to fear. This is just a story or a play that we're experiencing for a while. What we really are is beyond any description. All that is—it exists within the great ocean, which you can call God or Source, the great that which is. There's no such thing as truly being separate from it. We are completely and intrinsically connected and one with the whole, having the potential of the whole.  <br>So to have the opportunity to play a character here is like being given the most precious gift in the universe. And how then you choose to use that experience to make choices in it—choices that are hopefully more love-based and less fear-based (fear being reflective of the illusion of separation; it's not a real force)—but to really make choices that are in alignment with the truth of our being, even here.  <br>Now, the physical reality is extremely limited. Like, we are in an extremely limited state right now—extremely dense, very different vibrational context, extremely different. But it's neutral. So to act in fear is not our natural state. It's an okay choice, absolutely, but it's very much sub-optimal. Our natural activity is to integrate experiences into what we are, to really know them, to really come to terms with them, you could say, to really allow them to be a part of us without any barrier.  <br>Our true nature is non-dual. We use duality, we use context, we use form, but we transcend form. We are much greater than form. So enlightenment is just a very natural return to what we really are.  <br>You're listening to The Non-Duality Podcast. This is Nick Ham from nissangayoga.com. In this episode, Paul Dobson speaks with Christian Sundberg.  <br>Paul Dobson: You, sir, have a very unique perspective on reality that I haven't come across before. If you don't mind, I know you've had to tell the story a few times, but if you could go into what has created the context for this perspective you've got—the pre-birth experience, mainly.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so thank you very much for having me, sir. I will try to describe this, but I have to disclaim that everything we could possibly describe in this topic is vastly beyond language. You know, words are symbols; they're form. And who we truly are totally and vastly transcends the form of our world. We transcend form entirely. So to be able to use some language, some sense of form to describe it, it's just not possible.  <br>So, I'll try to summarize. I've shared this story many times, and there's a lot we could go into, but I'll just say for context: I remember a very long time ago coming across a being who had been physical before I had ever had a physical experience. So I existed long before I had physical experiences. And I came across this being who had been physical, and I was completely and totally inspired by the quality of this being's nature, his essence, the quality of what he was.  <br>This is really hard to describe because it's just so rich and deep. But I asked him—and again, this isn't words; it's telepathic. We all exchange naturally; we exchange information in huge amounts. That's how we typically communicate. I asked him, "My goodness, what did you do? How could you be this? How could you be this being?" And do you feel everything that I feel that you feel? And he shared, "Yes."  <br>And I felt in him this incredible sense of power and love and freedom and expansion and refinement. And I said, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I will do whatever it takes. This is amazing." And he shared that he had lived physical incarnations, and there was one in particular where he had had a chronic long-term ailment, a health condition that was very painful for him. And the way that he chose to meet that experience, the quality of being that he brought into that experience, and how he met that experience allowed an incredible refinement in his being.  <br>So I said, "I want to do that. I'll do whatever it takes. This is amazing." And he said, kind of in a playful way, not negative, but like, "Yeah, that's what they all say. You know, it's hard in a way that you don't know." Just very like, not judging me, just like, "You just don't know how hard it is to be physical in this way and to have this type of experience."  <br>And I said, "No, I want to do it." He said, "Go talk to your guides." Okay, so I did.  <br><br><br>Now, I'm going to jump to a period that is somewhat immediately preceding this life, where I had lived many times, and I was taking a long break after a previous life experience. I put off coming back for a long time. I just was done with the physical thing for a while. I was taking a long break.  <br>And this guide kept coming back to me over and over, asking, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And I just kept putting him off for a while, saying, "No, I'm not ready yet. No, I'm not ready yet." And finally, I felt like, "Okay, I'm ready."  <br>And then I reviewed with this guide what I can only describe as my state—like, this is so hard to describe, but like who I am, who I have been, and what I knew, what I understood, what I had integrated, the qualities of my being, you might say. And I could see very clearly the thing that I needed to work on—I don't really like the words "work on," but the thing that I needed to do that would be best for me to evolve through and to integrate.  <br>And it was this extremely low-vibration fear, a perspective that was such a low vibration that it had bested me in a previous experience. And I had, in a previous experience, been overcome by this fear, and I had been a very egoic monster as a result of this fear in one life, and I caused a lot of damage to other people.  <br>So I was very excited—incredibly excited—at the opportunity to re-engage this fear and to integrate this because I knew if I could do that, there would be this absolutely profound expansion of being, growth, and refinement, not only for myself but for the whole. It was an incredibly powerful thing if I could bring love and some amount of acceptance and the term I like to use is "quality of intent." You know, what intent? If I could bring the right intention deep into this experience and integrate it, it would be the most beautiful, amazing thing.  <br>But I knew even then that it seemed very daunting in its scope because the vibration was so low. I could just see very objectively, like, "Wow, I have a lot of fear. This is a huge challenge."  <br>So I asked the being, "Is it even possible? Has it ever been done in all of creation? Has any other being ever integrated a vibration of this extremity, this lowness?"  <br>And the guide said, "Yes, and you have all the time available to you to do so. There's no hurry."  <br>So I was super excited, and so they brought me a life that was perfect for this intention. And it wasn't this physical life; it was somewhat immediately preceding this life. The sequence gets very strange to try to describe because these experiences take place in a system higher than linear time.  <br>But anyway, they brought me a life that was extremely appropriate for my intention, and I reviewed that life in great detail, and then I accepted that life. And after I accepted it, I remember then accepting the veil, which is just the term I use to describe the constraints that we agree to adopt and to wear in order to incarnate and have a physical experience.  <br>It's like a huge, huge drop in vibration in the being, in the body of awareness of what one is—at least that's how I experienced it. And I like to describe it like if you have an amplifier that produces a pitch, and you're at a really high vibration, like me, you know, it's really high vibration, and then the knob gets cranked down to the bottom, and then when it gets to the bottom, just keep turning lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more lower still, go some more lower, lower, lower, lower.  <br>That was what it felt like to plummet from a place of total knowing, total connectedness, total love, total freedom, down, down, down, down, down, down, down vibrationally into this point of perspective that was so dense and so firm and dark. It felt so separate, and it felt like all of what I am was erased, like I lost all of everything that I am.  <br>And it was such a breathtakingly low vibration, and I immediately had fear. You know, even though I wasn't even born yet, I just said, "Come in." I was in the womb, and I was in this physical experience only for a few moments or some very short amount of time. And I was like, "You know what? I am not doing this. This is not happening. There is no way I'm going to tolerate this for a whole lifetime. I'm not doing this."  <br><br><br>So out of my fear, I immediately summoned my strength, my might, and I smoked the veil. I fought my way back out again, and I was successful in doing that. I found myself back on the other side, but I became aware that I had inadvertently killed the fetus that was to be the body that I was to use, that I was to have and be.  <br>And I had a life review, just like your death experience was described, but even for this very short life. And I could see how my fear affected not only the mother but hundreds of others because the mother had grief now. I had heaped sorrow on her shoulders, kind of feeling, and I had affected her, and not only her, but hundreds of other people, and ripples out from her, that their lives would be made more difficult because of my fear and how I affected the mother.  <br>So I knew, okay, so from that side, it's so you know, everything's okay. Like, there's no real problem. It's just a big play. It's okay. But I could see very objectively, like, "Oh my gosh, I have so much fear. I really got to do something about this."  <br><br><br>So that opportunity was wasted, but I still wanted to do this. So then they brought me this life, and this life was not as appropriate as the first one would have been. It was okay; it was pretty good. But considering the specificity of my intention and the qualities of my being, it was just like, it was still a good opportunity, and it was like what they could come up with, kind of thing. But it was good enough.  <br>And I reviewed this life in vast detail, and I reviewed what I can only describe as like a flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold. And I reviewed it all in the blink of an eye, you know, like within seconds. It was just so easy for me to review millions and millions of possibilities all very quickly. And I reviewed how it would feel like to be me, to be this human in this place and have this type of experience. And I could feel all these different branches of how the life might unfold.  <br>[Music]  <br>And I knew that it was very likely that in my 20s, my early 20s, I would be crushed by a trauma that would just really crush me, traumatize me, and give me the opportunity to re-experience this fear. And that did happen. I could tell you now that happened. My body is 41 right now, but when I was 22, I had a very traumatic experience.  <br>So, okay, then I remember there having to be a moment to say yes, and I don't remember that moment, but I do remember then being in this area I can only describe as like a waiting area, where I was in this realm of light, and I was excited. And then this guide came to me to get my attention, like, "Go now, like right now," very almost like rude, like grabbing my attention in a very firm and forceful way.  <br>And I said, "Okay, okay, now." And I found myself then in this room—it's not really a room, but it was like a place that's kind of like a mechanic shop or something, where these beings were very technical in nature, helping apply the veil.  <br>And they do this thing where they make the veil fit. It's like an organic thing, and they say, "So there's like the life and the constraints of the body and all the context, and then the soul is all these rich qualities." And so they do this thing where they make it all fit.  <br>And I remember them asking me one more time, "Are you sure? Are you sure you want to do this? Because once you say yes here, I knew that once I said yes here, I was in for the ride. It's like getting into a roller coaster, and once you're strapped in, you can't get out until it rides over."  <br>And I said, "Yes."  <br><br><br>And so once again, I had the experience of the veil coming over me, and my vibration plummeting down, down, down, down, down, down, way lower, lower, lower, lower, and all of my knowing being cut off, and all of the being that I was feeling like it was erasing, being just and disappearing, and arriving to this place that I mean, I like to describe it like arriving to the vacuum of space, you know, like a place that's just so empty, so dark, so without heat.  <br>That's what it felt like to be in this dense, very dense experience of being in the body, in the womb as a fetus. I was there for a short bit, and this time I tried just not to fight it. Like, this time I knew, okay, because I remember what happened last time, I just said, "Okay, just let the veil do what it will do."  <br>And I let that happen, and then eventually, after I had let go for a long time and I was in the dark, I remember sending one message back to the technicians, "Did it take? Did the veil take?" And I'm sending one message back, "Yes."  <br>So I knew I had made it, which was super exciting. And I was there for a while, and I said, "You know what? I am not doing this. This is so low vibration. This is so dark. I am not going to tolerate this. This is ridiculous."  <br>And so once again, because of my fear, I began to summon my might, my strength, to fight my way out. And when I did that, the most holy moment of my entire physical life happened. This is so beyond language that the great spirit of God, Source, the I Am, whatever word you can use, came to me in its grand fullness of being, and it said to me, "This."  <br>So it showed me. I felt the galaxies, and I felt the universe, and I felt they were still in me, and I was them. And I felt the churning bliss of our sun, the sun the earth orbits, and I felt so much just burning bliss, burning peace, and happiness, and just even in the sun. And I knew that that was still in me.  <br>And the voice said, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And that was so powerful for me. I was like, "Oh, because then I knew I didn't have to fight anymore because if I was still that, oh, that okay, so I haven't lost all that I am. Okay."  <br>And I surrendered. I let go. And so then I was in the womb for a while, and then the next memory I have is the day I was born. I remember the experience of stimulus, just like I had no understanding of what was happening. I just had this feeling of cold and touching and shock and light and like, "What is going on?"  <br>And I remember looking at these beings, like the nurses even that were there, and I knew that there were beings taking care of me, doing something to me, and I felt so much love for them actually, and I felt this incredible amount of curiosity, like, "Where am I? What is this place? What is going on?"  <br>And I have one just one visual image memory of the room. I know they say babies can't see, but somehow I saw the room, and I drew the room later from my mother when I was older, and I said, "You were here, and then the window was here, and he was the heating grate, and here was the doctor." And she confirmed I was right. I mean, I know I wouldn't be, but it was just cool to have that confirmation.  <br>So then I have no memory after that for years. I remember just sparse, very vague memories of being in a crib and things like that. But as I got older, like the ages of maybe three or four, I remember drawing upon this pre-birth experience memory and the flowchart in specific and trying to cheat and see what was going to happen in life. And that ability greatly diminished as I aged. You know, by the age of five or six, it was completely cut off, and by the age of six, then I had no memory of this at all.  <br>So my body is 41 right now. I had no awareness of this at all until the age of 30, after I had taken up a long-term meditation practice. After a few months, I began to have non-physical experiences, out-of-body experiences that were brief at first but very eye-opening, very not subtle, very worldview-shaking.  <br>And so then, in a similar time as those happened over the next few months, I just this memory was just there. It wasn't like a big discovery. It was like it had always been there. It was normal. It was the most normal thing in the world. It was like leaves had just blown over the ground, and now they're blown away. That's it. Oh, there it is.  <br>And in fact, it was so normal that now I feel very clearly that the strange thing is that we don't remember. That's the stranger. Yeah.  <br>So that's a summary. It's very difficult to put these things into words, and I actually don't think that—I mean, people are interested in hearing the experience, but I don't think that's what's really that important. I think what's more important is that we remind each other of what we really are and what we're doing here.  <br>You know, because all of us are on this incredible walk in the physical. You know, that's the name of the book that I wrote. We're just on a walk, on a journey where we've visited this—we are visiting this place for actually incredible purposes, great, great purposes. The purpose of the expansion of love and joy through the integration of experience, through choice-making in a rich context. This rich context where we've even come so far into separation that we've forgotten that we're connected, and then we've forgotten that we are unconditionally loved.  <br>And you know, we've forgotten what we really are for a while, and that is the nature of the human experience. So I think the more important thing then that we can remind each other is then that truth—that we vastly transcend this experience, and there is nothing to fear. This is just a story or a play that we're experiencing for a while.  <br>Yeah, so I went on for a while there, but no, that's great. Thank you so much for sharing that with me. I've heard it before, but I always enjoy hearing that, and every time you mention the great spirit of God bringing you back out and showing you what you are, I feel it every time. Every time you mention it, and talking to you one-on-one now, I really felt it—that relief, that absolute relief. Just absolutely, God, literally.  <br>I miss it so much. It's like even thinking about it is so painful. I just have so much emotion attached. I want it—maybe "want" is the bad word, is a shallow word. I deeply yearn and desire to have to be that again in a full sense because that's what we are. And that's one of the reasons we're veiled actually, because that yearning would be so intense, it's like almost impossible then to do the human thing.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I'm someone who's experimented with psychedelics and all sorts of exploration methods over my life, and in some ways, it made it easier, but in also a lot of ways, it made it harder, dipping back into that state and back out again over and over. It made normal life almost unbearable at some points where you just want to spend the whole time in that state. So I can totally empathize with that feeling.  <br>Yeah, absolutely. But here we are. There is, as you say, a beautiful, rich experience that we're in, and there is definitely beautiful reasons for being here. And just based on your perspective and your experience with things, what do you think we are really, and why are we here ultimately?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, what is that? Well, what we really are is beyond any description. Hmm. You know, quick question while we're human: we learn to view reality as a place and as a bunch of objects. We see an external, apparently external world, and then we learn about things, and it forms, you know, the sky, gravity, all these things. And there's certain fundamental properties—no, there's certain non-fundamental properties that are specific to our reality that we think are fundamental, like linear time and discrete location, for instance.  <br>Discrete location seems like the most obvious thing to us. We're separate; that thing is over there; I'm over here. You know, so I'm just saying that we perceive the world in that way, and we come to believe very deeply in objects and in form. So then when we want to know what we really are, we ask, "What thing? What are we? What form are we?"  <br>Well, we are that which transcends and knows all form, all things. We are life itself with the capital L. We are the substance of being that knows all these rich forms. And that substance of being cannot be described; it fully transcends all descriptors.  <br>So we—there are some metaphors. I think metaphors are the best way to try. We could say that all that is—it exists within the great ocean, which you can call God or Source, you know, the great that which is. And we are drops in that ocean. We are part of it forever. There's no such thing as truly being separate from it. We are a part of the whole, and we are simultaneously totally free-willed individual pieces and also completely and intrinsically connected and one with the whole, having the potential of the whole, each one of us.  <br>So that is very much beyond language, to try to describe that. So we could say we're individuated pieces of the one, and we are like maybe you know fragments or—I don't know—I like the word "drops in the ocean" better because drops, you know, a drop in the ocean is still connected; it's still part of the ocean.  <br>So what are we doing here? Okay, there are many layers of the self, and the human personality is just a lower—again, we transcend duality, so I'm going to use terms in duality. Yeah, it's not real; the duality terms are not real. But we are like the lower end of the self. It feels like, you know, the human personality, which belongs to higher levels of the self.  <br>And the higher levels of the self participate in the process of evolution, which is a process of expansion, and that is the growth of what is the growth of love and joy ultimately because our true nature is love and joy and freedom and peace and fun. You know, that is our substance of what we are.  <br>Okay, so then we will venture into manifest experience—that means experiences where discrete things are possible, like here, where someone is watching this video, sees a certain shape, you know, they see this guy talking, and they hear a sound, and then we have to interpret that. We apply our own meaning to it, and then we got to think about it and use thoughts, which are a new type of form—their form in the mind—and we have to think about what we think about that.  <br>That whole process of form, context, permits an incredibly powerful expansion of the self and of the whole. And that expansion is then a refinement of what really is, a refinement of spirit, of consciousness, which is a refinement and an expansion of love and joy ultimately. You know, that's really what it is.  <br>So we come for that purpose. And so, but we often hear though we don't experience that every day, right? I mean, this is like super, super, you know, Earth is a context that is extremely unique. We could even call it alien in how separate we feel. It is such a high-contrast level that there is an incredible amount of opportunity on Earth—or other physical worlds; it doesn't have to just be Earth.  <br>So to have the opportunity to play a character here is like being given the most precious gift in the universe. It's like being handed this precious, precious thing, and you, out of all the trillions and trillions and endless trillions of beings and all the vastness of all creation, you specifically were given the chance to be this, to play this character, to have this human life.  <br>And how then you choose to use that experience to make choices in it—choices that are hopefully more love-based and less fear-based (fear being reflective of the illusion of separation; it's not a real force)—but to really make choices that are in alignment with the truth of our being, even here. If you can do that, there is an incredible growth that is only—I don't even want to say it's only possible here, but it's practically speaking, it's only possible here to grow in certain ways.  <br>So the world, the universe, is like an assimilation that is provided to us for the expansion of being, and it's so convincing as well, isn't it? I mean, it's unbelievably convincing. I find it ridiculously convincing. I mean, I know as I say these things, it sounds woo or something, but I'm a left-brain type person. You know, I worked in the nuclear power industry as a project manager for a long time, so I'm used to using that. I know how this sounds, and it is extremely convincing.  <br>But the thing is, the more—how do we put this?—the greater the depth of the realness of it, the greater the opportunity. So it's very convincing because if you want to really be you, the human, you got to be you, the human. You know, if you really want to know what it's like, you got to actually do it. You can't just metaphorically stay in a higher state and read it in a book. You got to come and be it because the growth of being that we're doing, the integration of experience that we're participating in, is about actually doing it, actually being it, actually actualizing love, not just talking about it.  <br>You know, coming in and really knowing. And so, yeah, so it's highly convincing, very consistent. The physical reality experience is ridiculously consistent and personal.  <br>I remember the first time realizing that in a—you could call it a peak experience—and thinking, "Oh my God, I thought that the human stuff was the real thing, but this is yet—you know, it's not that it's not real—I just found it hilarious though. I actually couldn't stop laughing. I was in hysterics that I was 100% invested in the human stuff."  <br>Exactly. Yeah, this other state, so to speak, was clearly the home state. You know, yeah. Yes, absolutely. It is hilarious then because I'm so reminded of the near-death experience of Amy Call when you say that. She described how after her NDE, when she was aware of who we really are, she remembers these two guys coming to her front door. They were cable repair guys, and they came to her door, and they said, "We're here to hook up your cable." And she could not stop laughing because she felt and saw who they really were. They were these totally free beings of joy who had no limitation, no need, acting real serious, "We're here to fix you. We're here to hook up your cable."  <br>And it just seems so ridiculous. So we take it so seriously. We take our roles and our stories and our demands and our pains, our fears, so seriously. And I'm not making light of it because I get sucked back into it over and over and over. I mean, that's the nature of it. But it's just like you said, it's hilarious how free we are and how we really don't need to take the human condition seriously that seriously.  <br>I mean, it's important to—I try not to say the words "don't take life seriously" because then that implies you don't need to ever wield effort, and sometimes it is very much appropriate in a spiritual context to bring your strength to bear. Yes, that's true. Yeah, but we also don't need to take any of it seriously at the same time. No, it's just a play. Everything's fine. You can do whatever you want with life. You're free. You're free to change your beliefs. You're free to go outside right now. You're free to whatever you want.  <br><br><br>Now, there will be a result of your choices. You know, there's a cause and effect that's going to happen, but you're still totally free. You're completely free to make any choice, and there's a beautiful joy in there. Absolutely.  <br>And yes, it's just—I do wish everyone could maybe tap into that at some point in their lives or at least come to know it just in some way that everything is fine. As everything is absolutely fine, actually, the state of affairs is the best possible state of affairs imaginable and beyond that. As what we are, we're just kind of going through this seemingly pretty drudgery-type human existence, vibration by comparison.  <br>Yeah, very, very. And as you say, if we can bring that though, if we can bring that love—I mean, we're at the advantage that the fact that we are that love, you know, we are that love and joy. I love that. I love that statement that we are at an advantage because we are that. Oh, I love that so much.  <br>The house always wins. Exactly. Exactly. Oh, I love it, man. The house always wins. I totally agree. You know, like here in the physical, we tend to think "the house always wins" means reality is cruel and cold and harsh and uncaring. No, the cruel, cold, hearthstone caring is very limited in its scope by comparison. It's, you know, but yeah, yeah, I totally love that. The house always wins.  <br>I have one of the essays in the book called "Goodness Can't Help but Win." Yeah, it can't help but win in the end, no matter what happens, no matter what tragedy or devastation happens. Life uses all experience for the good. All experience. It can't fail. Even if the entire human race were to be wiped out in a nuclear event or something, like something that seems terrible, it's fine. Yeah, it's totally fine. It's just a small part of all it is. It's a simulation. It's okay. We go do something else. It's fine. You're fine. Even death is not a problem. Death is not a problem. Yeah, it's beautiful, man. I love that. That's how good this is though. That's how good this is. You can say stuff like that, and people think that just sounds crazy. That's how good this is, isn't it?  <br>There's a good—I like to sell that this is a good conversation because the reason it sounds crazy is because we become that deeply associated with the negative perceptions. We become so deeply associated with the negative beliefs, negative self-perceptions, and negative beliefs about the world. But that sounds crazy.  <br>I'm pointing that out because it's important to remind the individual that the power is actually in you. You applied the meaning. <br><br><br>Now, the physical reality is extremely limited. Like, we are in an extremely limited state right now—extremely dense, very different vibrational context, extremely different. But it's neutral. It doesn't actually have a charge. It's just like if you're laying on a couch, and somebody comes over and puts a very heavy weighted blanket on you, the weighted blanket is neutral.  <br>You get to decide. It's okay if you decide, "I don't like this. This is too heavy. I don't like this." Or you can decide, "Okay, it's heavy. I'm gonna go for a walk. See what I can do." We have all the choice in our reality with how to meet the physical, how to meet the circumstances of our lives. We absolutely do.  <br>And it's only because we've forgotten that we get so deeply wrapped in the thought patterns and the beliefs that we seem like that good—the truth of the goodness can't be true because look at all the pain, look at all my fear, look at all the story.  <br>I'm not making light of that because I know that once we get a momentum built up, it's very hard. It can seem hard at a given point in time to relieve ourselves from the momentum—the momentum of thought, the momentum of fear. But we always have the power in the current moment to stop and change that momentum, even just a little bit.  <br>Like, the universe wants you to succeed. Put it that way. Like, maybe not—I won't even limit it to the universe. The higher context, the spiritual context, you are it. It's a part of you. It loves you. It wants you to succeed. So when there are these moments, you know, so that's why we get these little nudges because you don't have to do it all at once. Just meet your experience wherever you are now in the best way.  <br>Whatever small thing can be brushing your teeth, it could be how you blow your nose, it could be how you interact with the person next to you at the store, how you admire the sunset. It doesn't matter. Every time, you get to choose how you meet reality, and that's what's so powerful. That will allow the individual to return closer back towards the truth of what we're talking about because it's like basically let go.  <br>Like, if you have your death grip on a rope, and you're holding on, your knuckles are white, and you're bleeding, your hands are bleeding, the way to relieve yourself is actually to let go of the rope, not just squeeze more rope. We do that with our stories and with our ego, our ego responses. You know, we get addicted to the ego patterns, to the thoughts, everything. Just relieve my fear, relieve my fear, fill the hole, fill the hole, whatever I need next, whatever next substance, next person, next event, next action, tell me something else I need to distract myself now.  <br>We do that our whole lives. When you let go, face the fear of letting go of the rope, it actually is a move back towards peace. Yes, the rope is what hurts. Yeah. It's so backwards to how we generally feel it is, isn't it? It's like I would say intuition, but that's not our real intuition. Our real intuition is actually to move back towards that peace, but maybe our human intuition is to grab tighter onto the rope.  <br>You know, it's a metaphor that you used quite a lot is when you've got your fist really clenched up, it becomes difficult to then open your palm, but the natural state of the palm is to be open, isn't it? So it's like the rope metaphor, but it feels like the momentum's gone that way. The momentum has gone in the direction of fear, in the direction of our stories, the egoic stuff.  <br>But every time, there's never anything wasted if we can just bring just little aspects every single time. We spend even just a second in presence, you know, just bringing a bit of love, a bit of presence, just to smile, whatever, in any way you can, it builds up momentum, doesn't it? The momentum then switches the other way, and it unravels itself.  <br>Absolutely. So it's not impossible. It's not you know, it might seem impossible, but it's not impossible. We will succeed. Like you said, the house always wins. Yeah, the question is how much friction will we create with ourselves and with others until we do that?  <br>You know, we just—you know, are we gonna have more friction? That's an okay choice too, but you don't have to.  <br>[Music]  <br>That's it. There's no wrong experience, is there? There's no right and wrong. Right and wrong is another sort of human mindset, you could say, an egoic kind of mindset or whatever we want to call that. But there's no actual right and wrong. All experience seems to be ultimately sacred and valuable and rich.  <br>Yeah, it's one of those topics that the ego of the mind, the thinking mind, has a really hard time getting its head around. So exactly what you said, all experience is sacred, and there is no moment that is not sacred. There's no choice we can make that is not okay.  <br>Okay, simultaneously though, it's—I'm very careful with this to say the words "there's no right and wrong" because then people take that in a certain direction. Yes, yeah. Well, I'll say that you may be able to say that as long as it's deeply understood that love is our true nature, and there are ways to actualize and reflect love versus fear.  <br><br><br>So to act in fear is not our natural state, and acting in fear—ego arises from fear—is painful. So yeah, it's an okay choice, absolutely, but it's very much sub-optimal, you could say. If you and then when you pass, you can see very clearly how you affected everybody else because they are you too. We're all connected. So you experience it from their point of view, and then it can be seen, "Wow, that was like when I was angry at that person, that really wasn't the most optimal way to help that person."  <br>So in that way, there is definitely a sense of—I'm careful about the words "right and wrong"—I'm just saying in that way, there's definitely a sense of love-based choice-making versus fear-based choice-making. That's the kind of—I 100% agree with you saying that.  <br><br><br>That's kind of the difficulty in talking about this because there's an understanding that all experience is absolutely just—well, it's all God essentially, and it's all sacred, and it's all perfect. Yet there is that aspect where, you know, it's if you can bring as much love to each passing quality of experience, those interactions, etc., as you can, you know, that's what it is.  <br>Yeah, that's what we're here to do. Is that what you said? Yeah, that's what we're here to do. Absolutely.  <br>So there's a kind of—that's the kind of irony, isn't it? If you can see the sacredness of all experience, you tend to be doing that anyway. Yeah. So it's not just the kind of theory, is it? It's not another theory to be taken on. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. The reality of our being and the reality of our being—the loving choice-making makes sense.  <br>It's not just like, "Oh, we're trying to be trained into some new behavior, and that's why we come to be human." No.  <br>[Music]  <br>There may be behavior that will arise. We will use behavior, but our nature is love.  <br>[Music]  <br>Yeah.  <br>I know it's very difficult to talk about this kind of thing, but I was wondering if you could maybe try and put some words to this. So in my experience of whatever it is we're calling the soul, when I've sort of dissolved into that state—whatever we want to call that—it's a completeness. It's not lacking whatsoever. It feels full. It feels full of love, joy, bliss, all the things you mentioned as well. And it just feels not lacking anything whatsoever from that vantage.  <br>How can we expand and evolve what that is?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, I understand. Yeah, so this is one of the topics that in duality sounds like a paradox. So here, okay, so there's two things that are simultaneously true. One, the soul is totally perfect, needs nothing, has no requirements, none, not a single requirement, and is in a substance of what it is, is perfect.  <br>And yet, within all realms of manifest experience, the soul is only so good at actualizing its true loving nature in a context. And so it participates in the process of evolution to ever refine itself in that direction.  <br>So how can they both exist at the same time? It's very difficult to describe in duality because, like I said, it seems paradoxical, but they're simultaneously true. You could say that the substance of the soul is always perfect, always. It can't be anything else. And yet, that substance refines through manifest experience.  <br>You know, we have engaged in a deep and rich multi-dimensional process of evolution. It's not just on Earth. Many, many reality systems exist within this great process of refining ourselves ever and ever towards—we could say—the perfection of the whole.  <br>We could say that each drop in the ocean has the potential of the whole, and so always is in the process of evolving itself towards that perfection, which also grows the whole. So does the whole need to grow? No. Is it happening? Yes. Because why? Because love is good. Because joy is good. Joy and love are good.  <br>And also, in the same vein, that sounds different, but it's actually the same—and because we're curious. We're powerful, creative beings who are curious. So we will come even into a state like this, really push the boundaries here, really do it. We'll even do that, even as we are simultaneously without any need. We choose to do it.  <br>I mean, that's really important to understand. It's not forced upon us. It's not like we're being used in some engine or something, and we're just hapless factory workers or something. Yeah, no, we choose to engage experience for the purposes of the refinement of being and for evolution because we see what it is, and the opportunity is amazing. And we know that we can't be harmed. We can't fail. We can't truly fail.  <br>So why not? So why not try, man? Like, why not try that? I'm gonna try that. I'm gonna do that. And then we get here, and we found out, "Holy crap, I am vastly imperfect."  <br><br><br>I mean, I think you would probably agree that this is really hard to describe, but if you even touch with the tip of your pinky, metaphorically, the higher self, it is the most humbling, just incredibly humbling. And not just the higher self, but the whole. If you even approach it, it is identity-shatteringly humbling because you see your own depth of your own imperfection.  <br>So we are both perfect and deeply imperfect. So yeah, it's a very difficult one to sort out for the human mind, isn't it? Because it can't use one or the other, isn't it? But it just happens to be that things are that way.  <br>Paradox is a good word for a human being because it admits that we can't really go beyond that. Exactly. I try in my book to identify paradox and why, you know, what it is and why it's not really paradox. It's only a paradox from this perspective. It's only a paradox when you buy into a perspective of duality that's not fundamentally real.  <br>And now, from the dualistic vantage point, you're trying to look up back towards the transcendent, it will look goofy because from here, it's either A or B. That's the very nature of duality.  <br>Okay, so but we don't need to fear that because the deeper parts of us know it. Like I'm saying, if you really feel into this topic, do you not feel the preciousness of who you are? The "I"? Do you feel, do you know that you feel the preciousness of life? That's the perfect nature of life.  <br>And then you can feel that, and then even though that's true, do you also not see you have fear? That's okay. They both are arising. Like, I actually rephrase that. It's not that the perfection arises; the manifest arises within the perfection. We can put it that way.  <br>Yeah, the perfection is. And then perfection is exactly yeah. So again, that's the advantage. The perfection is, and then you've got this fear, but the perfection is—well, the perfection is just not even comparable to this tiny little fear that's appearing. You know, it's so—it's um—amen. Yeah.  <br>So how best—I mean, we may have touched on it already—but how best can we meet that fear? How best can we not work through but just be with that fear? I mean, maybe for example, how did you in your experience because you had that really difficult time in your 20s—how was there part of you that was able to come through there and just be with that and recognize that I need to be with this experience in some kind of way which I can't do as an egoic self and just really be with it fully in your sort of loving presence?  <br>I mean, I'll let you describe how that was.  <br>Christian Sundberg: So not at the time. At the time, I was only traumatized, and I had PTSD for eight years—or maybe seven or six or seven years. So the key—there's a key mechanism happening that it's really important to identify, I feel.  <br>So the fundamental substance, we could say, is consciousness. That's what's real. So what's the fundamental thing that it's doing? It's intending; it's wielding intent, which means it's making choices. The choice-making is actually not directly in intent. Intent operates seamlessly through choice-making, but the intent itself is the key active ingredient and the power.  <br>So why do I identify that in the context of this question? Because it has to do with what intent you are bringing into your own life and your own fear. Okay, so what intent helps to process fear? Well, it could mean a great number of things actually, but I'll just highlight what's been very important at least in my own walk.  <br>It is the intention of completely feeling everything and allowing everything.  <br>[Music]  <br>Not fighting, not rejecting because fear happens because here's when we associate with a self-perception or a perception about the world that is not in alignment with the truth, and that hurts. And then we reject, and rejection hurts. So we need to reverse the rejection.  <br>Now, the problem is that when we get to our deepest fears, they feel too big to face. That's why they're fierce. That's why they're down there. That's why the ego is trying so mightily to fix the problem. Even the very experience of being separate is one heck of a problem that the ego is trying so mightily to fix.  <br>Even the experience of being separate itself, even the pain, even the negative self-perceptions, we can allow ourselves to feel and know all of it, eyes wide open. You know, it's not about fixing. You don't go into it, "Okay, I'm afraid of—you don't say, 'I'm afraid of being afraid. I'm afraid of being in pain. So I'm going to go feel this just so I can get rid of it because I don't like it. I can get rid of it.'"  <br>You almost have to—I mean, that's why intent is the key. The quality of why you're doing it, how you're doing what really are you, how are you meeting the experience of your pain? You don't need it to get rid of it. You need it because it's there, and it's in you, and you honor yourself enough to feel everything you feel.  <br>Just if you just sob as the little boy or girl that was still four years old and is still rejecting being criticized by the parent or abuse or something, to feel it, to know it, to really allow, and because we're here to integrate experience, that's what we're doing. We're integrators of experience.  <br>And that means when we have an experience—even painful experiences, all experience, good experiences too—we are trying naturally, like our natural activity, to integrate experiences into what we are, to really know them, to really come to terms with them, you could say, to really allow them to be a part of us without any barrier.  <br>And so when it comes to our deepest fears, that is so powerful. Now, if you do that, and you got really, really deep fear, okay, so first of all, the deep fear may be buried underneath hundreds of layers of ego story. So it may be difficult to even locate the fear.  <br>But if you can get all the way down to the bottom, and when you find the core, that root, it will feel like the fear is too big for you to even feel, too big to even process. It will feel like it will kill you if you even touch it. It will feel like lifting up a rug and finding a monster of such size and scale that you will die. You'll feel like you'll die if you look at this, if you feel this.  <br>So you could say the metaphor is like if a tornado comes to you and it picks you up, and you know, like it feels like a tornado is going to kill you, so it picks you up off the ground, it swings you around in a bunch of circles, and then it throws you to the ground. And when the tornado is done with you, it can feel so intense that the tornado is throwing you around, but when you're thrown to the ground, and you finally come to, you look, you open your eyes, you're not dead.  <br>You're actually alive because now all that energy that was in the tornado is gone. It was able to deliver its message. It was able to be felt and known, and now it can just dissipate in the wind. You know, and then what's left? The you that is there is far stronger because now you've done that. You've processed that. You felt that. It can go, and now you know forever in the eternal one now what it is to know that depth.  <br><br><br>You know, and now it's not greater than you. You've integrated it. So willingness—so to make a very long story short—willingness to face everything and to feel everything is key.  <br>So in some ways, it's fairly—it's very simple, but also very challenging. You could say I mean, you literally just—it's ridiculously challenging. You've got to be there for it. So that's simple, but at the same time, it's challenging because being there for it involves being—what most humans aren't willing to do, including myself—which is be uncomfortable.  <br>Exactly. Yeah, you've got to be incredibly willing to be uncomfortable and to be vulnerable. But here's the thing: Am I saying that now you need to be an uncomfortable person? No. What's uncomfortable is rejecting being uncomfortable.  <br>And what's uncomfortable is not processing. Living in fear is painful. And I still have fear. I'm still working through this. This is not a simple thing. I'm just saying that being in fear all the time hurts. It is a relief—a deep and profound relief—from the pain of being in fear when you face it and process it and allow yourself to be uncomfortable and feel it.  <br>And it can mean anything. It can mean being in a place where you're vulnerable in some way or naked or exposed, or it could be you don't want to face some perception or some experience that you couldn't come to terms with. I mean, it could be so many things, so many contexts and forms that seem to trigger and give rise to the fear.  <br>The fear is the—when I say fear, I'm talking about not the story. I'm talking about the deepest, deepest vibrational like why it's not okay. Go feel that. Yeah. And then—I don't know how you feel about this—in my own experience, it's almost like you can also be with the rejection as well.  <br>So you say, "Okay, I can't deal with this now. I can't. I just can't do it." You know, and then there's that. There's another layer, and as long as you pick it up somewhere along one of those layers, it's like the whole house of cards is pushed over. All the layers are broken.  <br>So you can just—it's not like, "Okay, I can't be with this right now. Fine. Can you be with not being with it? And then can you—"  <br>That's beautiful. That reminds me so much of an Eckhart Tolle quote. I don't remember the exact words, but it's something like, "Forgive yourself for not being at peace. The instant you accept your non-peace, your non-peace will be transmuted into peace. That is the miracle of surrender."  <br>Absolutely. Yes, that's perfect because yeah, that's not bringing more of the same to it then, isn't it? It's bringing peace to it as opposed to—we basically just gotta stop the violence, stop the war. You know, obviously on a whole human civilization level would be nice, but in yourself, like, and go, "Okay, now I need to be with fear, and I'm gonna be with fear." And then, "Oh, I'm so stupid because I can't be with fear."  <br>Yeah, then that's a new struggle. Exactly. So one thing about this—you don't have to go looking that hard because what's in you that wants to be processed arises into your experience over and over. Like, in the deeper parts of you know, and so you don't have to look very far. Just look at your experience. Look at what you feel right now. Look at your relationships right now. Look at your habits, your thoughts right now, and just, you know, and just like you said, be at peace even if you're not at peace, and work with them.  <br>This whole thing, this whole process, doesn't even though I just described a very visceral, strong—I just described the tornado throwing you around and throwing you to the ground. Simultaneously, while that may be the level of willingness to feel that you may need to have, simultaneously, you don't need to approach it as if it's a dire problem.  <br>It's not a dire problem. None of it is dire. Nothing is dire except that you've bought into it that it's dire. So when it arises, deal with that non-dire problem. Just face it. Just be there with it, and you know, be gentle with yourself. Put it that way.  <br>Yeah, exactly. Sort of self-compassion is important, isn't it? And it's so strange because it's again—this is going into what we might refer to as paradox—but it's one whole. You know, there's one always God, you could say, but then we've got these what seemingly individual soul situations, and we're each experiencing these human lives, but there's just the whole.  <br>And yet, everyone is so unique and individual, and their whole journey through this human life is so profoundly unique, isn't it? So yes, you might not necessarily have a massive trauma in the same way you've had to go through. It might just be tiny increments at a time or—oh yeah—almost not even noticeable. It might be a whole different thing going on for a particular person. So it's a really interesting situation where everyone's got their own little thing going on.  <br>Well, I'll just make one comment about that. So when we're human, it appears that we all have very similar experiences because we all have two eyes and a head and shoulders and a similar body structure. You know, we see a human experience that looks like it's quite shared, but the nature of the soul is unbelievably unique.  <br>Like, each one of us is so unique, has had so much rich, varied, beautifully different experience, different qualities, different history, different core nature that's very unique. I just think that's important to mention because you know, we tend to look around and say, "Oh, everyone is just—oh, I'm just another human." No, you are not just another human. You are a precious, beautiful, very complex, unique beauty.  <br>Yeah, it's amazing. It's beautiful. I think that's really worth mentioning as well because our temptation is to judge others as what we think is right and wrong from our own experiences, like, "Well, I would have done this, you know, and they shouldn't be doing that," based on our own experience, based on their own very unique, you could say, energy system and soul system, what have you.  <br>And so really, it's impossible to judge another human being for what exactly they're going through. It really is. The true judgment is not a judgment. It's a knowing. How do I describe this? The system knows the totality of all of your experience—every single constraint, every pain, every decision everyone ever made that impacted you, every cell in your body, every piece of food you put in your body, everything, and how everything has affected you. It knows, and you are completely understood for making the choices that you made.  <br>You know, it's not like if you're wearing a heavy weight, and it's difficult to run fast with a heavy weight on your shoulders, that's not a bad thing. You're honored for carrying a heavy weight and trying to run. It's not like you're judged, "Oh, you only made it 10 feet." You know, it's not like that.  <br>And here we all are in an extremely constraining, difficult context by comparison, and it's seen. Like, I've heard a couple of near-death experiences where they describe that from the other side, you know, we here, as humans, are seen as like superheroes or something because we're willing to come into this level of context.  <br>And that resonates with me because my pre-birth experience, after that first failure I had, I could see I had so much respect for the incredible players in the game that were willing to do this and play this ridiculously constraining, difficult game on Earth. Like, "Oh my gosh, I can't even tell you." And here we all are thinking that we're just these little inconsequential humans that are subject to the powers of society and the system and money and all these things. We're not just that.  <br>Yeah, so I just think that's an important message too.  <br>Oh, absolutely. And the issue with that as well is—I was thinking that we're just these little humans, and you know, subject to all the laws of society, the laws of physics, the laws of everything. You know, it's—the science is our kind of seems to be in this day and age seems to be the gods, doesn't it? And everywhere, that's everyone's go-to point, most people anyway, is science. They go, "Well, you've got a brain, and you're just a brain, and all this kind of stuff."  <br>I don't know if that's the kind of thing you've come up against and how you deal with that sort of thing.  <br>Christian Sundberg: So, I mean, of course, on the surface, that's a very basic conclusion that it looks like the brain is producing consciousness. Of course, but it's that is a very surface-level thing that's happening.  <br>And I love the process. I fully support all science because the process of determining what reality is and using objectivity and skepticism—that's a really important process. I mean, I'm one to say, "Don't ever just believe something. Go look, go experience, go make your own determination."  <br>This is not about establishing new beliefs. I mean, everything that I say, I don't want people to just take something I say and start believing in it. That's not gonna help. But you really gotta go see it yourself, like evaluate it, and what happens.  <br>But here in the physical, our scientists and so many of them, we're so deeply focused in the material that we think the material is reality. So of course, within the material system, which has certain rules, you know, our science is the study of those local rules of how the physical system actualizes.  <br>But eventually, science will expand because that physical rule set is a subset of a much, much bigger reality—a real reality, the spiritual reality. The spiritual reality is not a woo-woo fairy-tale thing. It's not just happening like in some imagination land. It's real.  <br>So eventually, science will expand and realize a lot of what's arising in the physical is actually originating deeper. You know, you could call it in a higher dimension. You could say that.  <br>So yeah, I think it's very normal for now to look at this. It's just where the human race is at, and our understanding. We're actually a very young species when it comes to where we are in our understanding. You know, we like to think we're nice and advanced. We're actually in the dark ages with our understanding in relation to the larger context into what's really going on.  <br>So you know, we will eventually get there. Until then, one last comment I'll make: as a process of investigation, science is a wonderful process. I encourage people to take that process of investigation towards something that we don't typically think to investigate, and that is consciousness itself, awareness itself.  <br>That is, if we can investigate what our own awareness is beneath thought, just go look. Don't make anything up. Don't make up any new stories. You know, you don't need a new—don't even think about it. Just go very, very objectively and faithfully just go look.  <br>And so that we call that process meditation. And it's so important, I feel, because as we investigate what our own awareness is itself beneath thought, don't settle for a thought. Don't settle for a new thinking understanding. Go and look. Go and feel. Go and actually engage it yourself experientially because there's so much there.  <br>The truth and the vastness of our being is there to be discovered, not as a new human thought, but it can be known within the deeper mind, which you are a part of. So it can be—I could even say it can be understood, but I don't tend to use that word because that implies human thinking, and I'm trying to direct towards something that transcends human thinking.  <br>It is a very deep, tangible, personal interface with that which knows thinking.  <br>Yes, and knowing isn't it? It's a knowing, isn't the correct word either, but there is no correct word. But it's a knowing. It's a change almost, a change of gears where you go from thinking mode, and thinking mode, once you go into the knowing mode, you could say the thinking mode just looks so tiny and so—yeah, just not dumb—is quite a harsh word, but almost a bit dumb in comparison because knowing is like instantaneous. There's no time lag. It's just boom, there. Exactly.  <br>And it's much more complete and thorough, and it's broader. And human thought is—if you think of it in a vibrational context, in a larger spiritual context, human thought is like very slow and crude and dense. It's like throwing around dense baseball bats slowly by comparison to the incredible amount of knowing and information, I could say, that is there that we can very easily interact with.  <br>So but it's while we're used to the dense, clunky, painful human thoughts all the time though, that seems like all there is. It's like Windows 95 versus whatever operating systems on their super quantum computer in a thousand years or something. It's just not comparable.  <br>Obviously, within the context, I usually speak within non-duality, and there's a lot of coming from Advaita Vedanta, sort of a Hindu tradition essentially, but we kind of have quite an open context where it's not specifically in any tradition, but there's obviously a lot of talk about enlightenment within the Eastern traditions.  <br>And I wondered where that fits in with all of this. Is human enlightenment a human-made idea? Is that something that's not really relevant to what we're talking about? Or if enlightenment is what we are, then yeah, I just wondered in your particular experience or what your perspective on that is.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Well, I think enlightenment means something different to different people. I'm very careful to use that word or quantify it. I'll simply say though that the process of awakening to our true nature is a very beautiful process, and that is really what we're talking about because our true nature is non-dual.  <br>We use duality, we use context, we use form, but we transcend form. We are much greater than form. So enlightenment is just a very natural return to what we really are. It does take a certain level of—oh boy, be careful how I say this—there is a natural mastery.  <br>Okay, so if we integrate experience of form to a certain degree, we eventually always discover it's not really the bottom.  <br>[Music]  <br>You know, when we really integrate our experience and really go through the process of seeing what we really are, what our thoughts really are, we will naturally return to what we really are beneath the form. You can call that enlightenment if you like, but it's very non-special because it's just what we are.  <br>And of course, all of us are into it varying degrees of like art. We each have our own relationship with the experience of form in our own consciousness, reach at different places. We each have different fears, different limitations, reach at a different stage of evolution, you could say that. And evolution is complex and multifaceted. It's not one line.  <br>So because of that, each individual's relationship with the higher divine, with their deeper selves, is unique. So enlightenment can mean very different things for different people. But yeah, I think it is pertinent because, like we've been discussing, that's really what we are. We are that higher nature.  <br>Yeah, beautifully put. I totally agree with all of that.  <br>You've got a great book, A Walk in the Physical, which does discuss some of what we've been talking about and some non-dual stuff. It goes into your story in a bit more depth and just has some great, wise advice from your perspective of living in general. And I think it's a great book. I'd highly recommend it to anyone listening. I believe it's up for free. I got the Kindle version, but yeah, no, that's something I want to make sure everybody knows that it's available for free. It's certainly not about money.  <br>If you go to my website at walkingthephysical.com, there's a book page. The third link down on the book pages is to the free Google Books version online.  <br>Yeah, the book is something that I felt for six years really needed to come into the physical, and I only wrote it as I felt spirit came to me and I felt what I needed to put down. I never once sat down and said, "I'm gonna write a book now." Like, I just wrote down as it was there, and then when I had all the pieces, I just allowed spirit to help me. I felt, "Where does this go?"  <br>And so I don't actually feel quite like the author. I mean, I know I wrote it, but anyway, I'm just very happy to share, and it's simply that I wish to encourage each person to help feel the deeper them that they really are. You know, really, the intention is to direct the reader back towards knowing their own self because there's nothing that I can give you. There's nothing anybody can truly hand you. You already are that fullness of life.  <br>So yeah, the book is an attempt to try to speak through the human mind to that larger context so that we can best know that and then hopefully bring love into this situation here on Earth because it's a great opportunity. It's a beautiful opportunity.  <br>Perfect. I was just wondering if there's any final word you want to leave us with or if you're quite happy leaving it there. I'll just leave that up to you.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, just a final comment. I just wish to reiterate: whoever you are listening today, you are not just this human story. You are a beautiful, free, loving, powerful spirit. Your consciousness, you are you—the you that feels like you to you, the most you to you. That's who you are, and it cannot be truly threatened.  <br>You know, things in life will change. Bodies can die, but there is nothing at all to fear. So whatever walk you have here in the physical, it's beautiful and precious in its own way. See if you can sense that deeper nature at least in a small way and bring it into today, just today, in whatever small way that you don't need to move a big mountain. Just go enjoy your day. Even just go enjoy something. That alone is a great service.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2021/77-christian-sundberg-pre-birth-experience-the-nonduality-podcast.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2021/77 - Christian Sundberg - Pre-Birth Experience - The Nonduality Podcast.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:02:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pre-Birth Experience, Incarnation Memory, Purpose of Life on Earth - BatGap]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Buddha at the Gas Pump is an ongoing series of conversations with spiritually awakening people. I've done about 610 of them now. If this is new to you and you'd like to check out previous ones, please go to batgap.com and look under the past interviews menu, or you'll see them organized in several different ways. This program is made possible through the support of appreciative listeners and viewers. If you appreciate it and would like to help support it, there's a PayPal button on every page of the website. There's a page which explains some alternatives to PayPal.<br>My guest today is Christian Sundberg. Christian lives in the Erie, Pennsylvania area. When he was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While that memory left him completely for his early adult life, it spontaneously returned at the age of 30 as he took up a meditation practice and went through a personal awakening journey. He also began to have out-of-body experiences, which we might refer to as OBEs. Christian has worked for over 15 years as a professional project manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing products—Homer Simpson's old job. Christian has also presented at over 80 public speaking events, as he now seeks to remind others, in at least a small part, of who we all really are beneath the human play.<br>So, welcome, Christian. Good to have you. I've really enjoyed listening to your entire book. Let me hold it up here. It's A Walk in the Physical. I converted it to audio and listened to the whole thing this week while walking in the physical, for the most part, the physical woods. I felt like I was totally on the same wavelength as you in terms of my kind of metaphysical or philosophical understanding of things, and that every point in your book could be a springboard for a conversation about something.<br>But one question I thought I would start with, before you even tell your whole story about how you ended up doing what you're doing, is: how is it that we know this stuff? It's like you speak quite authoritatively, even though not dogmatically, about all kinds of points that most people would consider to be kind of mystical, or hypothetical, or philosophical, or religious, or something. <br>But there's a certain confidence in your tone. And I can resonate with that. I mean, I kind of believe these things too. But do I believe them because I've read a lot of metaphysical books over the years, and I've been meditating for a long time, or am I actually tuning into some deeper knowledge, and that's why it makes sense to me? Because this stuff doesn't make sense to everybody. A lot of people would think we're nuts with the kinds of things we're going to discuss today. So, how do we know this stuff?<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: Well, the deeper parts of us are not just this experience that we're having—this physical experience in this character. The deeper parts of us know. We all sense deep down that we may be very deeply veiled for a time. Human experience is a relatively extreme experience in the direction of separation—apparent separation. But who we really are, the substance of what we are, the substance of our spirit or consciousness, it knows. We all sense deep down in some way that seems inarticulable what we really are.<br>And I understand, I recognize that I may have made certain statements in the book that sound confident—very confident. Most of the book is, but that knowing is not from some... it's really hard to describe it. When one is knowing one's true nature, these things are simply deeply known. It is not a matter of reading a book or coming across some new intellectual understanding. Intellectual understanding is its own... human intellectual understanding is its own limited subset of a much larger understanding that takes place within us. <br>When we're veiled, we tend to very deeply associate with the limited human understanding, and almost exclusively, perhaps even for an entire lifetime. But the deeper parts of us that transcend even some of the very fundamental properties of our reality, like linear time and discrete location, those parts of us do exist right now, and we are already connected to and a part of those.<br>RICK: Would you say that atheists or skeptics or people who might listen to the conversation we're about to have, or who might read your book and say, "This is all bollocks. None of this makes sense to me," would you say that they have that attitude just because they're more heavily veiled or shrouded than other people?<br>CHRISTIAN: I don't want to pigeonhole it by saying yes or no in that way. I actually relate very much with atheists, sometimes more with atheists than those who are very dogmatic, because it is important to have a skeptical mindset. I mean, that is a very important part of our journey—to be able to look at things objectively and to really evaluate them hard, with a hard-hearted evaluation. I do feel that the more we focus on the physical, and on our understanding of the physical, and on our beliefs and interpretations within the physical, the more deeply wrapped in it we become. The veil is kind of organic. <br>The longer we're here, the more focused in it, the deeper and deeper it gets. In fact, that's what it's meant to do. It is actually quite natural, when we're here, to have almost no consciousness at the human level. We do have consciousness at a deeper level, but at the human character level, it is quite common not to have conscious awareness of our deeper nature. And when that's the case, of course, materialism appears on the surface to be quite real and practical, and the end-all and be-all. But that's just the nature of the simulation—a very good simulation.<br>I don't want to categorize the type of person that might feel that way. Like I said, I very much respect those who are very skeptical, and atheists. I think that's just fine. There's no need to have an intellectual model. But for those who are interested in exploring, these things are very real. They're much more real than we can put into some words in a book or say to each other in the physical, because they transcend the physical entirely. We're very limited on what we can say. I think it's important that we share nonetheless.<br>RICK: I kind of agree with you. I also respect atheists and skeptics. I like listening to Sam Harris, for instance. And, in a way, I have a lot more respect for him than I do for the sort of people who just kind of undiscerningly buy into any woo-woo idea that comes down the pike. I ran into a woman last summer. We had had a big storm in Iowa called the derecho, which did billions of dollars worth of damage. Somehow that topic came up, and she said, "Oh, that was the Pleiadians. They came and caused that derecho." I was thinking, "Whoa, really? Must have been like teenage Pleiadians on a boring afternoon—let's go 500 light-years and do some damage in Iowa." People who think in goofy ways like that... I'd much rather listen to Sam Harris.<br>CHRISTIAN: I understand. Yeah, I can relate to that. I mean, I think we're very quick to grasp onto some new belief. It doesn't matter if it's this dogma, or this New Age belief, or maybe it's this guy in this video... maybe now I can believe him. It's important that we don't just believe things. In fact, the truth of what we are so transcends earthly content that we almost have to step away from belief in order to really experientially touch the truth of what we are. We have to be willing to rigorously investigate what we really are—awareness itself, which transcends thought. A belief is in thought. It's grabbing the new thought form, being like, "Okay, now that... I'm going to grab onto that. I've got to figure it out. The storm must be caused by this other thing, and now I'm going to attach these two things. Now we've got to figure it out." <br>Humans are very quick to then proclaim, "Oh, I've got to figure it out. Here's the truth now, let's share it." It can't be done. And I think that's one of the hardest things about any of these kinds of conversations because if you touch that substance of what we are, you know it cannot be said. It cannot be put into form. It's just so daunting to attempt to. In fact, I feel like even just saying one sentence, or writing one sentence, I'm just wrong. I just... it's almost like I shouldn't even try. But on the other hand, there is great value in the exploration process, and it is important that we proceed in the process of personal growth, evolution. That means considering new ideas and intellectually evaluating these things. So that's why we should share.<br>RICK: Well, if the kind of experience that you're going to be talking about here were common—if everyone had that kind of experience—then we probably could talk about it a lot more because we'd probably have much more of a common language for it. Like, if you go to a convention of people who like Italian food, you could get into big discussions about this kind of pasta and this kind of pizza and things that... and they all know what you're talking about because they've had the actual experience. But if you went and talked to some Eskimos about it, or something, they wouldn't have any idea what you're saying. It's a little bit of a matter of how rare or common subtle experiences are, whether or not we can converse about them.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, it's interesting... you use the word "subtle experiences." I know on the surface they appear to be subtle, but when they are actually known, they're not subtle. But anyway, I agree very much with what you're saying. It is one of the reasons I very much enjoy conversing with near-death experiencers, or NDEers, or pre-birth experiencers. There's a shared language, like we can jump to the end of the alphabet and have a real dialogue. There are a lot of people who are not familiar with it, and that's okay. That's the nature of what we're doing here.<br>RICK: Alrighty, well, you and I could actually go on for two hours like this without even talking about your story. But let's hear what happened to you, and then we have some interesting questions that have come in from people. We'll talk about all kinds of things. But tell us your story.<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: Sure. Okay. I'm going to attempt to share the story, even though we've already identified that it cannot be said. I just feel it's very important to say that because our true natures and the higher realms from which we come are just so beyond language that, like I said, it's just as soon as I put a word on it, it pigeonholes it. It's just wrong, but I'll still try. <br>Like I said, because I think it's important that we share this information with each other and remind each other who we really are because whether or not we all consciously remember it at the human level, I feel that we all have had experiences like this, at least to some degree, and they're in there. Whoever you are listening, they're in there somewhere.<br>Okay, so I'll start at the beginning of what I remember from my pre-life. But even order is difficult because while these memories do have a sequence, they also transcend linear time. They're all kind of happening all at once, right now. They're more like they're alive. They're real now, not just in the past, even though they do feel extremely ancient at the same time. It's difficult to put an identifier on that. <br>But I remember long ago, before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical. This being was so beautiful and overflowing with joy and power. I felt that from him because in those environments, you share what you feel, and who you are is shared with those around you. It's a telepathic exchange that's quite perfect.<br>I asked him, "My goodness, do you feel the depths of joy that I feel that you feel?" And he shared it with me and kind of let me go into it and feel it and dive into it. I was absolutely amazed. I said, "What did you do? What could you possibly do to become this, to be this, to have this quality of essence or nature?" He shared with me... what he shared with me, several things, but chief among what he shared with me was that he had lived physical lives. <br>He had had one physical life in particular where he had suffered very deeply for years, for a long period of time. The way that he chose to meet that experience, and the acceptance in the quality of intent—that's the Tom Campbell term that I love—the quality of intent that he brought into his experience there was so beautiful that it allowed a certain refinement of his being, of what he was.<br>I also asked him, "How were you healed?" Because I could sense how deeply he had been... not truly damaged, but damage is the only word I can think of... temporarily damaged through this deep experience of wounding, wounding that he had had in this physical experiencing. He shared with me that he was healed, and I felt the depth of this healing. I said, "I want to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that." I was just so moved and inspired. He said something to the effect of, "Yeah, that's what they all say."<br>RICK: What you've explained so far implies that people in the realm in which you were living, people who had had physical lives, were somewhat rare because you ran into this guy, and it's like, "Whoa, what happened to you?" And it's like, apparently you didn't run into such beings all the time. Is that a true observation?<br>CHRISTIAN: I mean, from the one specific memory that I have, yes, that would be true. I was... we were with many beings at the time, but he shone or shined with a brilliance that was very unique and definitely got my attention. I don't know how frequent it is. I do have a sense that there are far more beings who do not incarnate into physical experiences of separation like this than there are that do. We are the minority, I would say that, but I wouldn't dare to guess.<br>RICK: I pretty much assume that they don't... they couldn't be identified in some geographical or spatial location. It's more a dimensional thing, right? There's... which doesn't necessarily even overlap with our geography here in our location as our Earth. Is that right?<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, well, all I can say to that is there is a vibrational geography. There are many different reality systems, and the way that we experience them is rather unique, very different, depending on the rules of reality. Most of our thought-responsive Earth is much less so... it's still thought-responsive, but much, much slower. Because here we learn.<br>RICK: Because it's so dense.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, Earth is an extremely dense experience by comparison. So here on Earth, we experience spatial distance. That's one of the root qualities of what we experience here. That is not a fundamental thing. In fact, distance is an illusion. Physical distance is an illusion. There's not really a physical distance. There's the experience of distance. There's a big difference there. I don't think I'm going to try to identify how those places are separated, but I would say that there's a vibrational distinction between them that is very unique and potent and perhaps very unearthly. I mean, we're at... where I was, at the moment I remember, coming across this being, I was moving across what I can only describe as like a landscape. I remember a visual experience of being with many, many other beings of light. I perceived all of us as beings of light, and this being was with us doing the same thing. But his quality was hard to miss because of what he was energetically.<br>RICK: Interesting. Well, I suppose I won't ask too many questions right now because I want you to continue with your story, but could it be that many of the beings you hung out with had had earthly lives, but this guy was a much more highly evolved being among them, and that's why he shone so brightly?<br>CHRISTIAN: I'm only speculating if I try to speak to that. I don't know. I guess it could be. But all I know is that I remember that his quality of his nature was significantly... just like breathtakingly beautiful... compared to what I had sensed and who we were around us. I mean, if you want to put it in very crude terms, you could say I was... I don't like these terms, but a young soul by comparison, something like that. I mean, we had less experience... at least not in that way, had not done that before. And I feel that many of the others that were there in that environment, in that moment, were similar to me, whereas he was dissimilar. But I'm not going to try to speculate.<br>RICK: That's okay. All right, please get on with your story.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, sure. So, he encouraged me to go talk to my guides. And I did that, and so then, I lived many lives. I don't know how many, but at least in the hundreds, and I went back to him later, and I found him and I shared with him, "See, I'm doing this. I'm in the process of doing this." And he was encouraging.<br>RICK: So, between the time you first met him and the time you went back to him later, you actually went through hundreds, or a hundred earthly lives.<br>CHRISTIAN: I don't know if there were earthly... I just know that I was...<br>RICK: Incarnate lives somewhere.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yes. Some kind of physical incarnate lives. I don't know what they were. Then the majority of this pre-birth memory, though it takes place at a time that is somewhat immediately preceding this life. Where I had... okay, so I'd taken a long break. After a previous incarnation, I just decided I was taking a long break. Metaphorically, like being on a long weekend that you're not willing to give up, or a vacation where you're just like, "I'm not going back to work. I'm not doing that." And I remember this guide coming to me over and over again, like, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And putting them off repeatedly over and over. And eventually, he came back, "Are you ready to go back yet?" And I said, "Yes, okay, and I'm ready."<br>RICK: Can I just interject again? Are these guides people like you and I who have had earthly lives and now we're doing a stint as guides on the other side? Or are they of some other nature and serving, and maybe they haven't even ever been incarnate beings? Or don't you know?<br>CHRISTIAN: I don't know. I only know the quality of the nature of the being. Because everything... okay, when we interact with each other on that side, it's very personal and exposed and true and colorful. And so, the nature of the being that you're interacting with is known and felt by you. I don't know if this being was physical. I would, if I just had to guess, I would say probably they have been physical, but I don't know that.<br>RICK: All right, I'm sorry. Continue.<br>CHRISTIAN: No, it's okay. This being and I reviewed my state, like, who I had been, and what I was, what I had known, what I had done. And it was kind of like... this is really hard to explain. It's kind of... and this is a very crude metaphor, so please forgive the metaphor... but it's like if you looked at a bar chart or something, like a vast bar chart, it was like... it was obvious the thing that I needed to work on. I don't even like the word "work on," but the thing that I... that it would be best for me to engage, integrate, and grow through... it was apparent. There were many qualities that I had, and that I knew I understood that were part of me. But there was this one area that it was like... it was just blatantly obvious. Like, there was no careful discernment needed, it was just right there, glaring like, "Oh, yeah, I've really got to do something about it." And that thing... the best way I can describe it... was a fear that had overcome me in a previous physical experience.<br>This fear was so dark and so low-vibration in this previous physical experience that had led me down a path where I eventually died a physically agonizing death. I knew after that life that the fear had led me into this place where I experienced much pain. And it... and I was... it just bested me is the best way to put it. I was bested by this certain experiential vantage point, a certain low-vibration fear.<br>I was super excited at the opportunity to re-engage this because I knew that if I could meet this fear and integrate this experience, if I could do that, the expansion of being, expansion of who I was, and even the expansion of all that is, would be just unfathomably beautiful. It would be the most wonderful, beautiful thing to be able to do that. <br>But I also knew even then that it was like extremely low-vibration. So, I asked the guide, "Is this even possible? Like, is something this low, this far from source... has any being ever, in all of creation, ever integrated an experience of this vibration?" I was told, "Yes, and you have all of time available to you to do so, and there's no hurry."<br>So, I knew... and this sounds so strange to me now from the human perspective... but I remember knowing deeply and who I was, well, if it can be done, then I will do it. If it can be done, I will do it.<br>RICK: Someone named Susan from New York sent in a question related to this very point you're making, and perhaps it'll help you elaborate it. She said, "Christian has said he knows he is here to face fear. He's also described it as facing pain, and if he can meet the challenge, it will result in the development of great freedom. I'd personally appreciate it if he would try to explain what the fear is, what the pain is. I think that would be helpful to me and to others in trying to understand our reason for being here.<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: Sure. Okay, so when we're physical, we like to think of fear in terms of fear of something, like fear of spiders or fear of leaving the home or fear of heights or something. But fear is actually a vibration, which is very dissimilar from our native state. So, it is a self-perception that is not in alignment with the truth of who we really are. When we perceive something like, "I am not worthy of love," and we believe that, we suffer, we feel pain, and fear can arise because the truth is we are worthy of love. Or we might feel, "I have no freedom in my life," or "I have no power." These perceptions that we buy into are not in alignment with the truth of who we really are, and so they prompt fear.<br>RICK: There's a line in the Upanishads which says, "Certainly all fear is born of duality." So, when you refer to what we really are, would it be true to say that what we really are is beyond duality?<br>CHRISTIAN: Yes.<br>RICK: And that, because we have kind of stepped out into the dualistic field, fear is kind of at our... there's a certain root fear that we all possess.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yes, I think so. If you want to identify... I'll get back to the original question in a moment... but to speak to this root fear idea, the root fear is that separation is not our natural state. When we come... we're veiled right now. When we're veiled, we experience being separate. Everybody here feels separate from the objects around. Most people feel separate from the objects around them and from each other, and there's this unnatural disconnectedness, and our native knowing is gone. We feel like we don't know... I'm in the dark... and we're not connected to each other. So, that state of separation is something that is very non-native. <br>So, while we're here, fear arises naturally, and then the ego is just the portion of us that arises to try to fix the problem because now there's this big problem, right? Now we're separate. I don't like it. It doesn't feel good. I don't know what's going on. I don't have any power. I don't feel loved. I don't like... so, the ego is just grabbing on to whatever it can. Okay, now I have power because I can do this, or now I have value because I belong to this group, or that... whatever tricks the ego is going to play to try to fix the problem. So that's the... if we just want to very broadly paint a broad brush... that state of separation prompts a root fear in us because now we're in duality. Now, we think that duality is fundamentally real, when it's not.<br>So, in my case, this fear can best be described as the fear of being in a state where I perceive that I'm unable to escape pain, mixed with a feeling of being too proud to suffer. So, I reject this suffering. I can't tolerate this. I'm not going to tolerate this. I'm too proud for this. That vibration of rejecting my experience and not being able to escape pain is the fear.<br>When I was 22, I had a traumatic experience in Qingdao, China. I had a heat stroke, and I was in a Chinese hospital for four days. Whether it's the many bags of potassium they gave me or something else, I don't know, but I experienced this neurological burn. That was extremely physically painful, and that led to an extreme psychological pain because I could not escape this pain. So, I was traumatized because at the moment, I could not tolerate it. But I rejected it entirely and blocked it all off. And I went through counseling for seven or eight years to try to process that experience. <br>I did layer by layer through what's called EMDR therapy, meeting these many layers of fear that I had that really went back to my childhood but climaxed at this grand traumatic moment when I was 22. After years of counseling, I did end up finding the root fear of this... this terrifying moment when I was laying in a Chinese hospital bed, feeling like I was going to die. I had no power to escape this agony that I was in after my heatstroke. I can see it now. I can talk about it now, but at the time, it was quite... just breathtakingly painful to even look at.<br>So that's a way to... so that's my description of the fear. But it has to do with a vibration because the truth of our being is total freedom, total love, total joy, total peace. And so, what we do is we... okay, this is a crude metaphor, but if the source is like... I don't know, this is a duality, I'm presenting this in duality, so it's automatically not going to work, but I'll try. So, like, if our source is where we start, and then we can go this far away vibrationally to this type of experience, or maybe even this far away, or maybe even this far away... the further we can go in experience space, that is vibrationally, if we can integrate that experience and process that... and when I say integrate, I mean, meet it in such a way that not just intellectually, but in the being, as Tom Campbell says, at the being level, at the who you are level, you totally engage that experience and process it and come to terms with it and accept it and integrate it into who you are in such a way that it is no longer painful. If you can do that all the way out here, then there's this expansion of being that is breathtakingly powerful because we've come so far away in the physical that to do that here enables a fantastic amount of expansion, a huge amount of expansion that is not possible in other reality systems that are less... less strict.<br>RICK: So, this actually relates to a question that Frank in Norway just sent in. It says, "How do we contribute to creation with human creativity in ways spirits do not?" So, in other words, what you're saying is, as a non-corporeal being, we just don't have... I mean, we gain something in physical reality that we just couldn't without gaining a physical body. So, there's an evolutionary purpose to our coming here and being faced with challenges, sometimes extreme challenges.<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: Exactly, yeah. So that's very difficult to put into words, but I'll just use a crude metaphor. This is so crude, but it's very difficult to think of physical ways to express this. Okay, if you're sitting on your living room couch, watching the television, it's super comfortable and nice. You can sit there all day, you just sit there forever, and then eventually say, "I think I'm going to go for a run." Like, why would you ever voluntarily get off the couch, go outside, and run and put your body under stress and maybe suffer for a while while you're running? <br>Why would we ever voluntarily do that? Well, there's something that is available... growth that is available... only under the stress of the run. Now, that's a very basic metaphor. Here, what we are experiencing is the stress of the counter-pressure of circumstance, the counter-pressure of duality.<br>So, when we know pain, we know real pain here. We really experience pain here. Sometimes a lot of pain. What kind of choice-making, what kind of intent... that's the key... what intention can we bring forward even in that circumstance, when it's hard, when it's painful? When can we love the person next to us even when we hurt or even when they've been unkind or even when our bodies are failing? Or even when whatever... all the circumstances of life. <br>Can we do that? Because this is the place to do that. And when we can bring forth that quality of intent, even in the rich contrast, that allows a refinement of who we really are, which transcends the physical. So, when the physical is over, now you've stepped out of the highly constraining environment, but you retain the qualities of your consciousness that you developed while you were engaged in the physical.<br>I don't like to only pigeonhole this though, to just like personal development. There's a huge amount of development. He goes into... there's purposes that are greater than that, but I'm just focusing on this one idea for now, that when we drop the physical, and the dense constraints are no longer a part of us, all of that we developed of who we are while we were here remains. Now it is being actualized in systems that are far less constrained.<br>RICK: What about children who are born into very difficult circumstances and undergo a lot of suffering and die before they've even reached a level of maturity at which they have volition? Do even they gain something from going through an ordeal like that?<br>CHRISTIAN: Yes, absolutely. Now, it's the human portion of us that typically thinks that success means achieving some level of... some kind of maturity, whether it be physical or societal or something, and then getting something done. The spirit is consciousness. It knows experience. Experience is the currency... that's a bad word... experience is the stuff we're working with. If you can be a child for one year and have that experience, and then you pass, that's something that's amazing. That's an amazing experience. Also, then others that were affected by you and experience being with you here in this context, it's amazing for them because you added to the context for them.<br>RICK: This is actually a good segue for you to continue telling your story because you had one lifetime in which you didn't even live to be born. You died in the womb. So, continue with the story.<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, okay. So that's the next thing. After reviewing this, they brought me a life... not this current life, but an immediately preceding life that was perfect for my intention. I reviewed that life, and I accepted it because it was super appropriate for my intention, like the life had to be vibrationally appropriate and work circumstantially with what I wanted to do, what I wanted to experience, and it was very appropriate. Okay, so then, I had to accept the veil for this life. And this is the thing that I remember most. That is the process of allowing the veil to come over me and feeling the vast plummet in vibration of what I am, down into the physical vantage point. <br>I like to describe it like a pitch, like if you have an amplifier that's producing a pitch, then you turn the knob down. Then when you get to the bottom, turn it down some more, more and more and more, turn it down, keep turning it down some more, and then when you think you're at the bottom, turn it down a few more times. That's how it felt in the body of my consciousness, to go from all connectedness and all knowing, down, down, down, down, down, down this incredibly deep drop down into the comparative darkness and separation of being in the womb. Like, I felt all of what I was being like... it felt like being erased, of being cloaked.<br>And then, when I arrived at the physical place, which was as a physical body in the mother that had not been born yet, when I arrived at that place, it was very separate and dark and alone, and I didn't have my knowing, and I did not like it. So, within a few seconds, I reacted very strongly in fear. I mean, this goes back to your question about the root fear... that root fear arose mightily in me, and I was like, "I am not doing this. This is so dark. This is so low-vibration. What... I am not doing this." So, I mustered my might, and I smoked the veil. I fought my way out. I pushed past it. And as I did that, I became aware that I had inadvertently killed the fetus that was to be my body.<br>RICK: Do you have any idea what stage in the gestation process the soul enters the body, like three months or something like that, which is an interesting consideration because you weren't just a little zygote. At that point, you actually... developed enough perhaps to occupy a body that...<br>CHRISTIAN: I didn't develop enough. The body did. I mean, I was just becoming the experience, the bodily experience. So, I had a life review, and I became aware for that super short life. I don't know how long I was there, but it was not very long. I became aware of how I had very negatively impacted the mother. And not only the mother, but I felt these ripples like hundreds of other people that were negatively impacted by the mother because of the sorrow that I had imposed on her. It was like... I felt that I had heaped difficulty on the mother and hundreds of other people. I knew them all. Like, they were all my family, my friends, and I... and these players in the game that were playing the human game and things. I had so much respect for these other beings that were willing to be human, and I only made their journey more difficult.<br>RICK: Good going, dude.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, no, exactly. I mean, that's how I felt. From the other side, you know everything is okay. You have a very tangible... it's very clear that it's just a play, it's okay. But I was like, "Oh, man, I've got to do something about this. I have so much fear; this is too much." So, I knew that I wanted... I still had my intention to face and process this fear. But that life opportunity was wasted. <br>I spent some time in what can be called a veil acceptance simulator. It's just a... I mean, I don't know what it is, but it's a place that I went. It was like a room where you can practice surrendering to the veil. It's not a real veil. It's like a mock veil. It's kind of like jumping into a dark pool or something and having them plunge you under the water. And you just practice like letting go and being okay with being under this dark water. And you can cry uncle if you want to get out because it's not real.<br>RICK: I'm kind of like a flight simulator for pilots.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, like a flight simulator for incarnation action. Okay, so I did that for a while. And then they brought me this current life. I reviewed this life in incredible detail. I reviewed what can only be described as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold. And what it would be like to experience it and be it. It wasn't just physical events, it was more like, who would I be? What would it be to be Christian, as a human, at these various stages? <br>And it was... it was kind of like if you took a tree and laid it on its side, and the trunk was very thick, and the branches were thinner. You started at the thick, and then you kind of work your way out as the life progressed. It was like that, except there were millions of possible branches, some that were extremely likely, and some that were much less likely.<br>I reviewed all that, and I also asked certain things. I made certain requests for the life. Like, for instance, I said, "I would like to be intelligent again in this life because I knew I had been intelligent in previous lives, and I preferred that trait." They said, "Yes, you can do that." I also knew that my parents were important... they would bestow certain qualities to me, like, for instance, I knew that my father would instill confidence in me. That confidence would be paramount to me being able to have a rock to stand on to meet this fear. And I also knew that it was important that I'd be male... not in any way, not judging anything about the sexes, it's just that the two sexes have different energetic qualities to them. <br>There was something of an obtuse edge, even, some kind of edge, that being male would be helpful for me to meet this primary intention of mine... to meet this fear. So, I reviewed all that, and I was super excited. Like, if I could just communicate one emotion that was like the key emotion, it was incredible excitement. And I felt so deeply honored that I was being given the opportunity to be a human and to play human life. It was like being given the most precious gift in the universe. There's only so many slots, only so many precious character opportunities, and to be given one of those is like, "Oh my gosh," it was just like being given the most precious gift in the world.<br>Okay, so I remember there having to be a moment to accept the life. I don't remember that moment. But I do remember then the next thing is being in this place where they are preparing. Okay, well, actually, just before that, I was in this like waiting area, waiting for it to start, and I remember this guy coming to me, and suddenly grabbing my attention, almost rudely. Not rudely, but just very abruptly, like, "Go now, now you're on Earth time, you've got to go now. If you want to do this, now, like, jogging me out of higher time or something to get focused at the right place." I was then with these beings in this place that I can only describe it as these beings as like technicians, and this place was like... looked like a pit or something. <br>And these technicians, these mechanical beings, do this thing where they apply the veil to you. So, because the life has certain qualities, and the body has certain qualities and limitations, and the soul has many rich personal qualities, they do this thing where they like, make the veil fit, somehow they make it... it's like organic, and they make it like jive. And they asked me one last time, "Are you sure?" I knew that this was the last moment... like if I said yes, then there was no going back. This is like, once you press this button, you're in the rollercoaster for the whole duration of the ride. So, I said yes, and then I remember that the veil coming over me once again. <br>And it's huge, huge, huge plummet in vibration down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. And this time, just basically trying not to fight it. Basically, this time, just don't fight it. Just let go and let the veil do what it will do. Let it take hold of me. Like, surrender my control to it. It was important to surrender to it. So, I let that happen, and then moments later, I was here, deeply in the darkened, separated... dark is not the right word, but the separated state of being veiled, and I sent one message back to the technicians, "Did it take? Did the veil take?" And they sent one message back, "Yes." So, I was super excited, like, "Okay, I made it, awesome. I'm here." Okay, then I was there for a while.<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: Then I said, "I'm not doing this." Once again, I was like, "This is so dark. This is so separate. This is so ridiculously low-vibration. I am not going to tolerate this." Once again, I began to muster my might to find my way out. As I did that, the most holy moment in my whole earthly life happened. The Spirit of God, or whatever word we want to use for it... Great Spirit of the I Am, the light... came to me and showed me experientially all that I really was, the stars and universe, the galaxies. I felt our own Sun, the Sun of Earth, turning within me. And it was turning in bliss. It was just like this burning, rich, deep bliss being. I felt connected to all things again. Spirit said, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." So that moment is the most precious moment in my physical walk, and it calmed me. I was like, "Oh, that's still what I am. That's beautiful." So that allowed me to just relax in the womb, and so I was there for a while.<br>RICK: I get the feeling that the reason it makes you so emotional to think of that was not only the profundity of the experience but the sense of love that you were feeling, the amount of love for you that this intelligence who showed you the experience has.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yes, that's true. Love is our very nature, what we are.<br>RICK: Yeah, it's beautiful.<br>CHRISTIAN: And it was like... what I was afraid of losing... what I am. I sensed that I had not lost who I was.<br>RICK: Right, and you could actually say that to all seven or eight billion people on the planet, right? I mean, theoretically, they could all have that experience and realize that that's what they are. And it would... that would be true. It's just that it's rather rare for people to have an experience like that, but it's nonetheless true.<br>CHRISTIAN: I think it's not rare. It's just veiled.<br>RICK: Yeah, well, in other words, yeah, it's veiled. So, it's...<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, it's there unconsciously.<br>RICK: It's actually there, but it's covered over. Yeah.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah. The next memory I have is of being born. I remember the shock of being born, the temperature, cold, touching, light, sound, just a stimulus happening, and I had no idea what was going on. I had no intellectual understanding at all. I was just dumbfounded. I'm like, "I don't know what's going on, but this is intense." There's people touching me. I remember looking at the nurses, who I now know that were the nurses. At the time, I just knew that there were these beings taking care of me and dressing me somehow. I was like, "Oh, who are these beings who are taking care of me?" I felt so much love for them. <br>I remember feeling like an intense amount of love from just everyone in the room. I have just one visual image memory of the day I was born, the layout of the room, like where the bed was, and where the window was, where my mother was, where the heating grate was. Then after that, no memories for quite a while. I mean, I have some spotty memories of being in my crib here and there.<br>When I was about maybe like three or four, I remember being aware of my pre-birth experience, and assuming everybody knew we were just visiting, like this is just a neat place for coming to visit. I had assumptions that certain things in the other realities that are true would be true here. Like, for instance, I assumed that we would be able to feel each other's emotions here.<br>That's not how... you can't do that. Most of the time, we feel separate. And I remember feeling that like, assuming that if teachers or leaders, anybody in a position of authority or power, that they would be loving and wise, because in the other reality systems, any being that's in a position of... I don't want to use the word authority, but a position of help for leadership, is loving and wise. That's why they're in that position, because they're loving and wise. Man, it's taken me my whole life to really come to terms with how untrue that is many times on Earth. It's just not yet how our society is actualizing.<br><br><br>So, that's a summary of the experience. So, I had that memory until I was about five, definitely lost it by the age of six or seven. So, I had no memory of that. I went, I grew up. I had my traumatic experience at age 22. And then at the age of 30, I began meditating. After a few months of meditation, I began to have grief at first, but very impactful, non-physical experiences that were very eye-opening. They were very, like, not subtle. Like, shockingly, how could I experience that? <br>That was crazy. Then as those experiences started, I also began having these memories return. But as they returned, it wasn't like, "Ta-da!" It was like, they were always there, I could just see them now. I was like, "How did I ever forget that? It was the most natural thing in the whole world." It was just always there, but I just didn't see it. <br>And then focus, I did not share this experience for the first seven or eight years. I felt like it was not the right time. I just felt like it just wasn't... like the ground wasn't fertile. And a few years ago, I felt like, "Okay, you should share." So, I'm doing it. I'm sharing that message. Because that's what we really are. We're not just this human character walking around living these lives where we feel fear and limitation. We are so much more and, I feel like if we can just remind each other of that then, man, that can go a long way to helping that love, that higher nature, come into this very dense place, actualized that for each other. I mean, that's a great thing if we can do that.<br><br><br>RICK: Yeah. I was reminded as you're speaking of a quote from an Indian saint, named Swami Brahmananda Saraswati. Anyway, he said, "To get a human body is a rare thing. Make full use of it. There are 4 million kinds of lives which the soul can gather. After that, one gets a chance to be human, to get a human body. Therefore, one should not waste this chance. Every second in human life is valuable. If you don't value this, then you will have nothing in hand and you will weep in the end. Because you are human, God has given you the power to think and decide what is good and bad, therefore do the best possible action. You should never consider yourself a weak or a fallen creature. Whatever may have happened up to now, maybe because you didn't know. But now be careful. After getting a human body, if you don't reach God, then you have sold the diamond at the price of spinach."<br>CHRISTIAN: Wow. I love it. That's right on.<br>RICK: Like that. A whole bunch of questions have come in, and I want to be sure to get to them. It might cause us to jump around a little bit. One is from Martine in Belgium, and I think you have already kind of covered it. She said, "Do you remember your existence before this birth? Obviously, you've just been describing it. Was it human or as a being?" Maybe you can say a little bit more about that second part because I've heard you say that, fundamentally, we're not human beings, we just happen to be those at the moment. But our deeper, more eternal existence is not actually human.<br>CHRISTIAN: Right. Yeah. So, human is something we experience. It's not something that we are. We experience being. It feels like we're it. Who are you really, then? You are the you that feels like you to you. You are you. You are your consciousness, and that you, when not bound to the limitation of the human experience, is far, far, far more than just these associations that we have while human. <br>We tend to think of... again, we think of everything from our earthly experience as a reference point, so we see humans and objects and animals and, well, what are we? The forms are something that we experience, we entertain. The forms are like the tools and toys of creation. Who is that, that uses the tools and toys? You are. The you that feels like you to you is what you really are.<br>In those other systems, people want to know, "Do I have a body? What do I look like? What can I do?" I try not to speak too much about that because usually it's the ego that wants to know that kind of stuff. But also, because you just can't put words on realities that are so very different from ours. There are Earth-like thought-responsive reality systems that are very Earth-like, and we can do extremely Earth-like activities, but there are also states of being in which the activities, so to speak, that we're doing, are so vastly different than what we can even imagine within the human limitation.<br><br><br>RICK: So, if you had been a cow in your past life, let's say, obviously, you weren't a human being you were a cow. But for the cow's subjective experience, there's something that feels like you to you, to use your phrase. It feels like... in the sense of sort of self or something.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, they seem the same exact self. I don't have many specific memories of past physical experiences. I do have a few. One of them, I remember sounds pretty wild. Going out on a bit of a woo-woo branch here, but I remember being a migrating bird. I remember the stress of flying for ridiculously long distances. I remember this very spiritual quality of it. But it was also very dissimilar from human awareness. There was no cognitive power, it was just experiential. That's hard to explain. But that was still the same me. So, then when we return to our higher selves that's just the term we use, higher self it's still you. When you know the fullness of what you are is a better way of saying higher self. You are the one being who did all these things. <br>It's just like... this is another very crude metaphor, but it's like if on Monday night you went had dinner, on Tuesday night you went to the movies, on Wednesday night, you played golf, and on Thursday night, you took a hike through the woods. Well, were you different people? No, it's the same you. The difference, of course, here is that in this reality, we remember taking doing the things each day of the week, whereas here we specifically veil, become veiled on purpose, so that we can have such a very specific deep, immersive experience of being human character for a while, but it's still the same you who does those different things.<br>RICK: Interesting. It kind of reminds me of actors. Like they say, for instance, Leonardo DiCaprio gets so into his roles that he stays in character even when they're not shooting the scene because he just wants to be so deeply immersed in it. Of course, he doesn't forget that he's Leonardo DiCaprio, but it's kind of a metaphor for it.<br>CHRISTIAN: It's very much like that. It's kind of like if you see an actor in movies, they play different roles, but there's certain qualities about that actor that always shine through. Like, I feel like Tom Hanks, for instance. Tom Hanks, I think he's a fantastic actor. I love watching Tom Hanks. He plays very different characters, but it's always Tom Hanks. That's kind of how we are as souls. <br>We may play different human personalities for a while, but the real, who we really are, true or deeper qualities shine through. We may have qualities that are specific to the local human, or limitations, even, biological limitations, or whatever else, or circumstantial limitations from how we were raised or whatever, but who we really are, shines through to those characters and is persistent from character to character.<br><br><br>RICK: Yeah, it's interesting that we're talking about this because last week, I interviewed a woman named Eva Netanya, who's a Tibetan Buddhist practitioner and scholar. We talked a little bit about reincarnation and everything. She was saying that from the perspective of that tradition, there isn't a discrete being that moves from life to life and just assumes different bodies. Rather, there's... it's hard for me to even repeat it, because it doesn't jive with my understanding. <br>But there's some kind of stream, and that is not really... there's no person, but there's this sort of stream of karmic tendencies or something that moves through life to life. But that kind of contradicts the more Vedic perspective, like in the Bhagavad Gita and all, where they talk about, like the kind of things you're saying... that you are a being and you move from life to life, the way we change clothes in this life, and the whole purpose of this sequence of lives is to evolve, sort of higher, to higher and higher scales of enlightenment.<br>CHRISTIAN: I think they're both true. It's just... it sounds... there's a good number of things that when we talk about them from the earthly perspective, two things that are both true can sound paradoxical, because we believe in duality. So, it's kind of both. We are discretely... we have a discrete experience of being this person in this being, and yet there are karmic... if we want to use that word... energetic themes that run from experience to experience. <br>Like this fear that I'm here to deal with. It is an energetic theme that I'm engaged with. It's too big for one experience. But it, so it runs with me. I'm responsible for it, put it that way. We are responsible for who we are. I think that's an important point about this idea of karma. It's not like you're being punished. It's just you are who you are. And look, now that you went and had this experience, you actualized who you are, maybe in a way that hurt others. <br>And now that you did that, that's part of you too now. Now that that's part of you, oh, now it is best, if you can. These things are really hard to explain or describe. Now it's best if you can meet that part of yourself that would benefit from evolving and evolving through that limitation and growing. That's why karma is helpful, actually. It's just that you are being led to the places that you... I don't like to use the word need, but that would be best for you to engage.<br><br><br>RICK: Okay, that's a good explanation. Regarding the veil, I was thinking about that while I was listening to your book, and I was thinking maybe a good metaphor would be... see if you agree with this... that if you got an went to school, for instance, and throughout your schooling, you were just sort of given the answers to all the tests you're going to take, so you didn't actually have to study for them. You could get very good grades in school, but you wouldn't really come out knowing anything. You wouldn't really have done the work necessary to learn it because you were shown the answers. <br>So, it's like if it weren't for this veil... give us some reasons, maybe that's part of it. Give us some reasons why we do get blinded by this veil when we come into this life and why we don't normally have the kind of memories that you have? And are you at any disadvantage for having these kinds of memories compared to the rest of us?<br>CHRISTIAN: First of all, I'm very veiled. I'm still extremely veiled. And I'm very thankful, actually, because it can be very painful to have some of this awareness because it's like, then there's a homesickness that accompanies it, which is ridiculously painful. So, I'm very veiled, and in fact, I have felt called many times to focus physically so that I can deepen my own veil, so I do that.<br>First, I want to make a comment to your point about the knowing the answers to the test. What we're doing here is not an intellectual learning. It's an experiential learning. The goal is not to get 100% on a test when the server or the system already knows the answers to the test. It's not the goal. The goal is to experience being the person who's taking the test and growing as a result of going through the process, not just achieving some end. The experiences themselves are teaching. They are like a language for the soul.<br>Okay. So, then the first reason... why do we become veiled? Because how would you be a male named Rick who gets up in the morning and has to go to the bathroom, eat your breakfast, worry about your next guest and scheduling it, and maybe your wife said something to you today that you're thinking about, or maybe, whatever is called the context. You wouldn't be that perspective if you were the higher perspective. You would be the higher perspective. So, the veiling is very additive, actually, because it allows a fresh personality to develop within a specific context that is immersive. The immersiveness of the experience is meaningful for the quality of the experience. Now, can you have an experience that's not immersive? <br>Yes, of course, there are many reality systems that exist, where spirits will engage in experiences that are not veiled, or maybe less veiled. Even this type of experience is far in the direction of apparent separation. We're not actually separate. We're never actually separate from each other or from source; it's not possible. But we do have an experiential distance. We've come really far... like we're put, this universe is like us pushing the boundaries like, can we go, can we take it to this next level of rigorous separation, because it is in that contrast, that is the very value. <br>One is that allows you to have... one reason that we're veiled is it allows you to be the human character, to protect you from homesickness. Because if you remember and knew consciously beauties of higher realms and of what you really are, you wouldn't be going to work in the morning. You'd be... it'd be a mess because the reality of that is so, so rich, and so beautiful.<br>And it's... all this kind of tying together, then the third one is it allows you to not get distracted, because you're focused completely on this. Yeah, so I guess that's the best way I can put it. I do mention a few other ideas in the book, but I feel like those are the high-level, the high-level explanation.<br>RICK: Okay.<br>CHRISTIAN: For as I understand it, I mean, I'm not claiming to have all the answers. I just remember knowing that, okay, I have a part of my previous memory that I didn't mention is I remember... again, this is going to sound strange. I'm just going out on a limb here. But I remember that when our universe was to be created, there was this moment when this intent was being issued forth from source, and we were all involved. <br>It wasn't... it was like a big, huge collective, yes, next level time, like there's this huge in-breath and out-breath of manifestation of universes. We'll say it that way. So, we're getting ready for the next level, like, okay, we're going to take it up a notch and make it even more... we're going to go even more deep, rich, separate, like, so exciting. <br>So exciting that we're going to do this, the level of excitement is just off the charts. Now I wasn't around... I was I was doing something else. I don't know what I was doing. I was doing something else at the very beginning. But I remember coming early, and sailing among the stars, and just reveling in the idea that we would actually get to be these things. Not just people, anything in the universe that we wanted to experience being, and that we would actually be able to fully immerse and have those perspectives. And that was the most exciting, beautiful additive, so additive, such a creatively additive process, that we are going to be able to participate in that. And the veil is required for that. That's kind of a long, long-winded answer. But I remember knowing that was important.<br><br><br>RICK: Two questions. One is, do you feel that everything that everybody experiences, small or large, is sort of intelligently orchestrated to provide some opportunity for evolution? And that nothing is trivial or random. Everything has... is pregnant with possibility.<br>CHRISTIAN: Everything is pregnant with possibility. I am careful to say that it's all intelligently orchestrated. There is a great intelligence who has orchestrated the novel simulation, and it knows everything. But I'm saying it that way because there's a novelty to the human experience. What I mean is unanticipated outcomes can happen. We're all making free will choices, and because of that, there is such a thing as, "Oh, that wasn't anticipated. Look, now that's exciting." So, now we're going to deal with this new circumstance that wow we didn't even think that could happen, maybe, but now it's happening. <br>That's part of the creative power, and is every one of those experiences full of possibility? Oh, absolutely. Every experience, every breath, every second lends to evolution, and towards the integration of that experience since the expansion of what is. If you think about all that is with a capital, ATI, all that is, what is, all that is becomes more when new things can happen. So, everything that happens within it tends to lead towards more, and that is a beautiful thing.<br>RICK: Second question. When you're talking about being around at the start of the universe, do you feel that our souls, our individual souls, are eternal? Or did they somehow come into being at some point in time, perhaps as little, tiny seed souls that get to be butterflies or something and then they evolve up and become, occupy more and more complex life forms?<br>CHRISTIAN: Well, okay, I think it's both. The soul is eternal. It's... okay, so the ocean is an ocean of the whole, is what is, it's eternal. The soul is, metaphorically, like a drop in the ocean that has been made sovereign and free will. But to limit the journey of the soul to some kind of physical incarnation cycle is an inappropriate limitation. Because the soul can, and does, engage in many, many other types of experience and evolution that are not based on a physical incarnation cycle process. Physical incarnation cycle is just one highly specialized, very potent, possibility. <br>But the original question is both that the soul is eternal, and also there is... these are topics that any language will immediately fall short, incredibly fall short. But I do feel it is simultaneously eternal, and that it's like... I think you sort of seed, like planting a new seed, there is there is a seed of possibility that is born from the substance of what is, and then that seed goes on its own journey to evolve in its own way. It has its own free will choices and its own ability to choose and grow. And that is what's additive about it. Is that that individual piece of the whole makes its own choices, goes through its own growth, and adds to what is by doing that.<br>RICK: The Hindus, at least some of them, believe that the universe is cyclical, that we have a universe and at some point, it collapses down and then we don't have one, there's a period of rest, which they call pralaya, dissolution, and then eventually another universe comes out, but they say that all the beings in the universe actually go into that rest state at the time of the dissolution, and then the very same beings come out again, and resume, whatever level of evolution they had when they went in and pick it up from there.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, that sounds appropriate to me with the memory I'm describing about the creation of this universe. It was a period of deep rest. And then there was the creation of this new, like a simulation. I can't speak to what we were doing or anything. I mean, it's just this is so beyond language now. But as a basic metaphor, I think that's about right.<br>RICK: And, so obviously, you're on board with the notion of free will. It kind of sounds like, well, the play is scripted, but there's plenty of room for improvisation.<br>CHRISTIAN: Ah, no, the play is not scripted. It's just the system knows us really well.<br>RICK: Well, like you said, before you came into this life, there was a great deal of planning and like a big database with branches and all possibilities.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, that's not a script though. That is a prediction about how it probably will go. But it's not scripted. Scripted, to me means pre-established. It's not pre-established. Free will happens. And it's just that, as Tom Campbell puts it, the system has all the data and it has, it knows all your history, knows your choice making and the choice making of everybody else, and importantly, there are energetic themes that not only the individual is going through, but the...<br>okay so in a given simulation like on Earth, the human collective consciousness goes through eras, shall we say? Energetic eras where it explores a broad theme, and then moves on and explores another broad theme. I'm generalizing, but it's, I'm just saying that there are these kind of seasons energetically, that occur within a given place or a group. <br>So, the system then knows that that's happening and that that is the general direction. And those are the inner sort of general energies at work, as those are the energies at work. It can predict very well what is likely to transpire once the free will participants are let loose within the context. The context is known, everything about the context is known. Every detail about the context is known. The only thing that's not, and then the decision making that will be made, is anticipated, but yet free.<br><br><br>RICK: I interviewed a guy named Rob Schwartz, and one of the things he says is... feel free to disagree with him, he wouldn't be offended... but one of the things he says is that the major events of our life are kind of, not predetermined, but we kind of like review them before we're born. Alright, well, I'm going to get hit by a car, or marry this person, or get this disease or whatever. <br>But then there's two, then once we get into the life, then there can be all kinds of fine tunings and changes in, even changes in plan. Perhaps if we work out the karma for getting hit by the car, then we'll just stub our toe instead, or something like that. But there are certain major things that are set up. An event. Even things like I'm going to be a murderer or an abuser or something, we agree to take a certain role because it might serve some kind of karmic purpose, even though it would be seen as very odious.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, so in my previous experience, I set, okay, I knew that it was extremely likely that I would suffer a trauma in my early 20s that would crush me and allow me to re-engage this fear. And indeed, that was integral to my purpose. So that was, in a sense, pre-established. And, of course, there are, so, when I say free will, I don't mean free will to choose any choice in the entire universe. Once you're here, you have to choose within, you have to follow the rules, you got to choose things within the context.<br>RICK: But you have your wiggle room.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, you make choices from what's available to you to make choices. And what you know you can make choices. I mean, a lot of people have a lot of choices available to them that they don't see. Now that's quite normal, too. But anyway, as an example, in this case, I knew that this body has a physical limitation that other bodies don't, and that many spirits would pass it up. I actually knew that it was like, but for my purposes, I knew it was it was very helpful, because it would cause a day-to-day discomfort in my experience that would pressure my ego. It would make sure that I did not become an egoic monster because I would suffer. And I knew that was helpful, actually. So now that I'm here, I make this, I have the ability to choose what I'm going to do within my decision space. <br>That's Tom Campbell's term, decision space. But I still have this limitation in my body, and that was known beforehand, just as the trauma that I would very likely experience was known beforehand. So, I don't see any disagreement with Robert Schwartz's... I read a part of one of his books. That was very interesting. I don't really see a disagreement with that, from what I experienced, and I can only I can only speak to what I experienced. I have not analyzed; Robert's interviewed many pre-birth experiences. I don't have that kind of research under my belt. I just know what I reviewed before I came here.<br><br><br>RICK: Okay, good. Incidentally, I've interviewed this Tom Campbell you keep referring to, and people can find that on BatGap. There's a lot of other stuff of his online. He wrote a book called My Big TOE. TOE stands for Theory of Everything, and he's a very interesting guy. Let me get to some more of these questions. Here's one from Nick Cush in Oregon. "On the other side, are there parallels to the organizing principles behind earthly society? Here we have external forms of government and social institutions that regulate and harmonize life all held together by many roles and functions that must be fulfilled, as otherwise we'd live in anarchy. Any idea how beings that aggregate together on the other side organize and collaborate on a large scale?"<br>CHRISTIAN: I can only speak to what I remember. I will say that there are many different systems of reality. What happens in those realities is highly dependent on the ruleset of those realities. What's, how things work there. In most realities, there is a sharing of being that is telepathic and complete. <br>And so that alone changes very much how things happen because here on Earth, we have an incredible inefficiency in our ability to communicate with each other and organize effectively, just communicating takes us a huge amount of effort. Whereas there, there's almost no effort at all. So that affects very much how things happen. I will say, just as, like a general example. So, okay, I'm just picking out one specific memory, and I don't know the context of how this one place fits into other places because like I said, there are many different realities, and they may have different contexts. <br>But I remember that it was very common to basically focus on what you want to focus on. And there's no such thing as being rude if you just leave because that's not interesting to you anymore. So, if there's a group of beings doing some activity, and it's not interesting to you, you're not going to hang around and just like, be polite. No need for that. Because you're you, you're exactly you.<br>They're exactly them. They know exactly what you're feeling, you know exactly what they're feeling, that's not interesting to you, you go off to something else. That's just a simple example. In our society, we have a lot of like, convention, that what you're supposed to do, how you're supposed to behave. <br>I don't think I can get more specific than that. I will say, I guess I'll just at least add that there is, like I said, not an authoritative structure. But there are beings of love and wisdom that guide us and help us. And they know us very well. Like, incredibly well. So, there's help in that. And if you want to call that an institution, I mean, I don't, I probably wouldn't call it an institution. But there are guides, there are many guides at work right now, actually, in fact, within just our earth system, many non-physical guides that that work with us and help us. I won't try to speak to any kind of institutions or anything like that.<br>RICK: I know some of the ancient traditions like the Tao de Ching, for instance, talk about how the more enlightened a society is, the simpler a government can be or the less government it needs. I imagine that these higher realms the, however they are governed or organized, it's a far cry from the United States Congress.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yes, I would say that's probably true. It's not even a comparison.<br><br><br>RICK: Here's a question from Lisa Teasley in Los Angeles, "How does your work as a product, Project Manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing products contribute to the evolving of your soul, as well as evolve your relationship with the earth?"<br>CHRISTIAN: It's a good question. I recently lost that position I had for 16 years. I was a project manager for nuclear valve projects. My company closed the facility I was working at, so I'm currently in between jobs. But to speak to your question. So, I need to play the human role, like we all do. I seek to do the best I can for my family, which includes earning a living. But I also feel that presence can be brought into any role. It's not just a matter of doing one thing or the other, there is a possibility to be present and to bring a quality of awareness into any context. I seek to do that. I don't know what future work I will end up doing. I'm open to whatever happens. As for the earth, I don't know if we want to get into a conversation about nuclear power. I personally feel nuclear power is quite safe. Not bad for the earth. I feel it's a good alternative. That's just my opinion because I've worked in it.<br>RICK: Well, yeah, we have had Chernobyl and Fukushima and Three Mile Island, which are extremely problematic, to say the least, but perhaps more.<br>CHRISTIAN: I don't discount those happening. That's true. Fukushima was quite a disaster.<br>RICK: Still is, but I have heard... we don't go off on this tangent, but I have heard of potential nuclear technologies that would actually use up all the waste fuel that we now know, don't know how to store, and it could be very safe and so on. So maybe something like that will come along.<br>CHRISTIAN: Well, I don't feel strongly about that topic. I'll just say that it's more that I have I played the human role as we all do, and I'm hoping to succeed for my family. I did it in a way that I don't think there was any harm, at least in that. Fulfilling that role as a project manager and nuclear.<br><br><br>RICK: Okay, good. Jill or whoever asked that question, wants to ask a follow-up, feel free. This one is from Jill in California. "Since we are all part of the one, how did it come about that some souls get more evolved than others? Did we not all start out at the same level? Perfect?"<br>CHRISTIAN: Well, we are perfect. Yeah. Okay, so this is something that sounds like a paradox.<br>RICK: I like your use of paradox, by the way. You keep bringing up paradoxes in your book, and I really like the way you do it because somebody actually sent me a t-shirt that had paradox on it. Because I've said so many times that I really appreciate that word.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah. Well, this is a good example of paradox. Are we perfect? Or are we evolving? And the answer is both. The substance of the soul is perfect. How it actualizes within manifest experience is evolving. So, when the soul... I don't want to use the word begins, because again, we transcend linear time, but the soul needs to make its own choices and grow and evolve in its own way. That is the rubber meets the road value. We, you may, you could say that we work in evolution towards the perfection of the whole, and the whole itself is ever refining also. <br>Now, I don't want to say source is imperfect, I'm not going to say that's not true either. But it is ever refining. There is a never-ending process of evolution that is taking place, which is constantly adding to the joy and the love, and the creative manifestation of what is, and you and I are participating in that process now. Being able to be you in the rich context of this life and actually make the hard choices that is where the rubber meets the road for that very real growth. This is a real system. It's real, it's a real thing, it has to make real choices in real environments that are, that could be, real difficult at times.<br><br><br>RICK: There's a British friend of mine, philosopher named Tim Freke, who's been on BatGap a few times. He has this belief that somehow what, that God is somehow coming into existence as the universe comes into existence. St. Theresa of Avila, in fact, said, "It appears that God himself is on the journey." I kind of argue that, well, to even have the universe, you'd have to have all the laws of nature that give rise to it in some kind of latent form, within the unmanifest field from which it arises. <br>They'd have to sort of be able to function perfectly as they emerge, or the universe wouldn't be able to emerge. Then there's this sort of fine-tuning argument that intelligent design people use that, or people like Robert Lanza, biocentrism, that there are so many variables that have to be just right, or we wouldn't either have a universe, or we wouldn't have a universe with any life in it, and so on. So, I don't know. Can you riff on those ideas that I just brought out?<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, the law you're talking about, what Tom Campbell calls the rule set, or the reality. That is, if you imagine you create a video game, and you create rules, how does the game work? Well, source has had a heck of a lot of experience, over many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many iterations of experience. It very much knows and understands what works. Of course, it's going to set the rules in such a way that there can be evolution. And, so once it is initiated, then free will participants apply themselves within the context, the context being the rule set now that we have to work with. That's our physics. <br>Now we choose, now we play biological creatures. How do we do what are we doing today? We're having this conversation over the video, now. Now we're choosing how to actualize here through the physical, and this physical maintains and sustains and continues to operate because the rules have been set forth for it. But it's just like Tom says, it's like a virtual environment; it's just the way it was made. It evolves as we evolve because it gets kind of let loose, set loose, and then it transpires, manifestation happens, evolution happens. It's a beautiful process; a rather huge, beautiful process.<br>RICK: Are you saying that source is this vast repository of knowledge and experience and data or whatever we want to call it? That it actually, despite how vast it is, is continuing to evolve? Are you further saying that the universe itself is, or universes perhaps, are the means through which it evolves? There's that saying, "I am one, may I become many," or is the becoming many a way that this source actually becomes even more than it already is. The entire shebang is like this huge evolving thing.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yes. Though I don't want to pigeonhole the purpose of physical creation just to say that source has to evolve so it's going to do this thing. It's not about need. It's about love and joy.<br>RICK: Love and evolutionary.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yes, evolution continually is happening because joy and love are good to know and to experience. What I'm saying is evolution through manifest creation is an expansion of love and joy. The ability to make choices within this context, to be this, these characters, and to make these beautiful choices every day, through all of our contexts is a beautiful process that adds to love and joy ultimately, and that happens through us who are the individuals who are part of the one. So, yes, that is true. Now, it's also, we're just also incredibly creative as spiritual beings, we are just so powerfully creative, that we also really just enjoy seeing what we can do. <br>There's like a curiosity element to it, almost like a very simple, beautiful creativity, a curiosity, to see how creative we can be in this kind of a way. That is also a part of why there's so much manifest creation, like I said, the forms of our lives are tools and toys, of spirit, of consciousness. This is just an example of, wow, let's see, can we really do this? Can we really take it to this extreme separation, and get super dense? Let's try. There are many beings who won't risk... won't use the word risk, but won't choose to have this kind of, this level of separation. But those of us here who are human, are the ones brave enough to do that.<br><br><br>RICK: Yeah, we're creative. It's said that man was created in the image of God. But, when you look at God's creation, it's a heck of a lot more creative than we are. I mean, look at anything, look at a fly's wing, or a single cell, and look at how incredibly, vastly complex it is... far beyond our understanding even. And then think of the entire universe going out in all directions, just with the same level of intelligent, creativity and creativity functional. Anywhere you look throughout the whole vast thing. It's mind-boggling.<br>CHRISTIAN: It's mind-boggling to the human mind that thinks of one thing at a time and is very small focused. To the spirit...<br>RICK: It's all one day's work.<br>CHRISTIAN: Something like that, yeah, something like all in a day's work. This is what we are, we are incredibly creative, vast beings. That's just this universe, you're pointing to. I'm being kind of cryptic when I keep referencing other reality systems, but that's just this place. It's much bigger than that.<br><br><br>RICK: Yeah, we could think of that two ways, maybe like bubble universes scattered all around, like bubbles in ginger ale. Or there's also like, certain traditions talk of different levels. The Vedic tradition speaks of seven levels of heaven and seven levels of hell, and so on. There are just all these other dimensions that are just done on different wavelengths.<br>CHRISTIAN: There's a point that I think is worth mentioning there. That is that, and I know this is going to sound very strange.<br>RICK: You keep saying that [laughing].<br>CHRISTIAN: I keep saying it because I know how these things sound to the mainstream person.<br>RICK: Well, this isn't the mainstream audience.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, probably not. The physical universe is taking place within us. Not the other way around.<br>RICK: No, yeah. Perfect. Yeah.<br>CHRISTIAN: Feels like you are in a body. No. The body is an experience happening within you. What you? The body of your awareness that feels that it's alive right now. That living field of awareness, that living presence, the body is happening on and in it; in fact, the entire physical experience is happening on and in it, just as it is happening on and in the consciousness of every other participant as well. <br>That's really what it is, a shared virtual experience taking place on pre-existing consciousness. It's not your consciousness is stuck in some kind of real object called a body. Then, if there's all these other realities, they also take place within consciousness and you also, they're also within you. You can't actually be separated from them, because there is no separation.<br><br><br>RICK: Yeah, I'm glad you said that. Because as we were talking about bodies evolving through various lifetimes and so on, I could sort of hear people saying, yeah, but, what about the universal self and you're just talking about the individual self. It's one of those paradox things where on the one hand, our individual expression evolves, but then, unbounded awareness, which is what we ultimately are actually contains everything and so on. Okay, more questions. <br>A lot of great questions coming in today. I want to keep moving so I don't miss any. Sharon Ridder from Maine said that one afterlife expert in quotes, told me that not all angels and spirits believe the same thing. Is this true? Are there various beliefs and perspectives even in the heavenly realms?<br>CHRISTIAN: Okay, we like to bucket, the whole afterlife into one bucket. We tend to be like, there's earth and then there's the other side. How is it over there? That's a little bit like throwing every earth location into one place. Earth has a lot of different locations. Our physical universe has a lot of different locations, other universes have a lot of different locations. I'm just saying that in the context of the question because it depends on the state of being at which is happening, in a given reality. But in realities where there are personalities walking around with manifest experience, walking, maybe not literally walking, but when there are beings that are there with manifest experience, yes, of course, they have unique experiences. <br>They have unique perspectives. They are unique. Where there is uniqueness, there will be a difference in perspective. It's quite natural. Now, that doesn't mean that there will be disagreement necessarily because in those states, we tend to be able to share all of what we are, all of our perspective with the other and it's just seen, and actually, it's a really beautiful, wonderful, even blissful process to share your perspective with someone else and to feel their perspective and their history, and you share who you are, and they share who they are, and wow, it's amazing. And so, there's multiple perspectives that can coexist, with some, that's something that's we don't typically experience here on earth.<br>RICK: Good. Here's one from Akshay in Puna, India. "When does spiritual experience occur? Does deep understanding lead to experience? Or perhaps it is not in our hands to bring about this experience? If I make an effort, is that not the ego?"<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: Okay, so first, this is going to sound like a cop-out. But I just, this is important. There's no such thing as an experience that's not spiritual. It's all spiritual. Every single thing is made of consciousness. Everything is happening within consciousness, by consciousness, of consciousness. Now, what happens is, though, we experience being separate, and the separate self operates through an ego, and so when it grips onto that ego, and it's trying super hard, that tends to actually create more of a distance, even though there's not actually a distance, it tends to create more of a perceptual distance because now we're deeply associated with this need, this, oh, well, I'm separate. <br>Now I've got to, I got to find this answer. So, if we let go, and we look at what is already there, with no need... there's no requirement on you. There's no stress, there's just, you just look, it's already there. <br>Does that mean, it's something you can go do? No, I mean, I agree that as the separate self, you can't sit down and go do it. I can't go sit down and meditate and make myself have an out-of-body experience. That's not how it works because that's my separate self. That's not how it works. But, if one is willing to fully be alert, and to feel everything to be fully present with reality, those larger parts of ourselves can rise up on their own. Then they're just there; always were there. It's just we were so deeply associated with the story that we couldn't see them.<br>I personally feel that meditation... people say, what's the activity I can do? What can I do? Oh, there's not really an activity, but if you want to name one, it's meditation because meditation is simply taking, setting aside the time, to investigate very, objectively, rigorously go look, go look at your awareness. Go explore what consciousness is when not lost in the story, not associated with the constant thinking. Now when someone can know what they are without the thinking. The thinking is like dreams. Thoughts are like dreams. <br>We associate with this thought and this thought and our whole day, I'm thinking this and thinking this and that's, by the time the day is done, we had about 1000 dreams, all these individual thoughts. It's all I am, and we hurt and we're suffering because we're associating with all these thoughts. Well, it can be then beneficial to spend time associated with a deeper awareness that knows the thoughts. Because if we do that, all on its own, our higher nature can just kind of gradually rise up and we gain experiential familiarity, that we are not our thoughts. There is an incredible, incredible freedom in it. I don't know if I spoke to the question successfully.<br>RICK: No, that sounded good. Better answer than I would have come up with. Also, I would say that if you do a practice of meditation, it's an effective one, then the oppressiveness of your thoughts diminishes over time. They become firstly, less cluttered, less frequent because usually the mind is full of all kinds of chaotic static that doesn't really serve any purpose. All that stuff goes away. But then also, thoughts are not so gripping and dominating as they might once have been. And if an inappropriate thought comes up, it's possible to kind of nip it in the bud or catch it near the source from which it arises and not have it carry you off on an undesirable tangent.<br>CHRISTIAN: Exactly.<br>RICK: Here's a question from Wesley Morton in Oregon, "I sometimes wonder if the Earth is a prison planet. The energy is so dense with so much darkness, so many people are living hard lives. Australia was initially colonized with British prisoners and social outcasts. Is the earth analogous? Is this a dimension where outcast beings get sent to do hard time?"<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: I feel the answer is no. What's interesting about the earth experience is that we get to apply the meaning. Okay, so if we see a world that is trapped, we see examples of that trapped-ness in our own history, Australia, for example. We tend to then impose that interpretation on the experience, and then we wonder, am I understanding that correctly, because we've interpreted it that way, because of what we've seen our own perceptions and our own pain. <br>But that is a, I'm not discounting that perspective. I'm just saying that is a rather duality-focused idea. It's kind of earth learned, and who we are transcends that duality. Typically, when a spiritual idea is, like I recently heard this idea that, don't go into the light because reptilians are using us to reincarnate over and over, and they're siphoning our energy off. <br>I heard that a few times. That's another example I feel of, well, we see a world of duality and struggle. We then interpret it and then impose that interpretation higher up. We think that's the way reality is, so the higher reality must be that way too. No, the higher reality is based in total freedom and love and joy. We tend to take the painful interpretation that we've gone into and impose it up the ladder, so to speak. <br>The good news is, we are actually free to apply the interpretation and to reevaluate it. So that's a really key point. It sounds maybe not so important, but it's very important that we have the ability to apply the interpretation onto this experience. It is super dense, super low vibration by comparison, but it also is a neutral, the earth experience. We out of our fear apply so much negative fear-based interpretation because we have yet to evolve to integrate all of it. Just high, high contrast, but neutral.<br><br><br>RICK: Yeah. And what you've been saying is that living in a dense dimension, a dense planet is not a punishment, it's an opportunity. That's why you came here. That's why we come here. Because there's something that can be achieved here that can't be achieved just by hanging out on the other side. I guess just to put a lid on that, just that the whole purpose of our existence is evolution, right?<br>It's to continue to evolve to higher and higher levels of evolution. If we could do that by remaining as sort of angels or spirits in some kind of heavenly realm, we would probably do that. But we obviously can't, because we don't. So, I just kind of feel like, oh, go ahead. Do you want to comment on that?<br>CHRISTIAN: I just want to say that it's fair to say the purpose of what we're doing here is evolution. That's okay. But I would actually, but in the context of what you're saying, I would actually take it a step down, even one step further, which is the purpose is love. Evolution is just what happens when love and joy express and grow, through choice. Love is really why, it's really about love. <br>Love is our purpose and our reason, and it is the power. Evolution is the more neutral term of the process of us growing and evolving and it's happening. I'm not discounting that I just want to point that out.<br>RICK: Perhaps you could define evolution as the process through which we become capable of expressing more love. We become conduits for greater and greater amounts of love that we can sort of infuse into the world.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yes, I agree with that. It is simultaneously what we already are. And it is something that grows and refines as we integrate manifest experience.<br>RICK: Sure, if we already are that, fine. But if we can't live it, if it's not a living reality, if it's not something that we can experience while engaged, I mean, let's take a step back. I mean, why did the universe manifest in the first place? Wasn't it just sufficient to be sort of unmanifest and, just chillin' all on its own, the source? I think, perhaps there's something to be gained and having become a living reality, some kind of expansion of happiness, expansion of love, which just didn't happen, wouldn't happen otherwise.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yes, it's an expansion of what is. An expansion of all it is. We do that because we are immortal, loving, creative, powerful beings who are going to do even that. We are so loved, and so free, that we will even come and be human. To integrate this level of contrast. I'll even go to a place where I'm going to get so grumpy and upset because this world hurts so much, and I'm going to wail and rage for 80 years. We're so loved that we're able to make that choice. It's so very important then that while we're here, we do make loving choices now that we're here because we came all this way. It's like that quote you read. <br>It's like a waste of a precious opportunity if we can't make this place better, bring love to each other into the world, grow in the love of what we are. That's a loss. But if we can do that, oh my gosh, it's so beautiful, because that's what we are. It's all about love. It's all about love, even the small ways. It doesn't need to be a big, huge like I moved three mountains and made a million dollars. I mean, it's nothing about that. It's the smallest act of love is unto itself, unto itself worthy for the whole universe. For the whole universe one act of love, just one act of love, the whole universe celebrates and is celebrated when there is one true loving act. Just one. It's beautiful.<br><br><br>RICK: In your book, I heard you discuss people who do bad things when they're on earth, and then what happens when they die and so on and so forth. We don't have to dwell on the horrible things people do, we hear them on the news and every day, but, in your understanding, what awaits those people when they drop the body, they cross over the other side, and get a pat on the back, hey a great lifetime? Or is there some kind of retribution or learning or something they have to do to atone or to learn? So as not to do that kind of thing again, or what?<br>CHRISTIAN: There are two very important points that are simultaneously true. Once again, this might sound like a paradox. But these two things are 100% true, both of them. First, is we are unconditionally accepted and loved. Unconditionally loved and accepted, no matter what. That's the first thing. The second thing is, and this is also 100% true, we are completely responsible, 100% responsible for every single thing we have done. Every thought, every intent, every bit of energy that we wield. There's like an energetic accountability of who we are because it's a part of us. Sometimes we call that karma. It's a general word. The idea is, you don't escape who you are and who you've been. <br>What that will mean for any given person is very unique, and very personal. But if someone leads a very fear-driven life, and hurts many others, that is not something that they just escape. It's now that's what they are, and now they need to deal with it. In my case, in the life where I died an agonizing death, I was a very not helpful person. I was a very hurtful person. In this life I have experienced a great deal of suffering. Now, I'm not saying that it's, it's not a punishment, it's just I have that much fear. I have that much fear and fear hurts. But even that is an opportunity. <br>You see, this whole system is built within a bedrock of unconditional love, which furthers the growth of love. So, even that ultimately serves the expansion of love. There's no such thing as, fear has true power, and now you're screwed. No, it's all within love. It's just that we benefit from being energetically accountable, it's the only word I can think of what we have done and how we have affected others. That can mean future experiences that could potentially be very painful, whether in a non-physical environment, or whether another physical environment, not as a punishment, but as a process that is just a part of our experiential growth.<br>RICK: Yes, and certainly not any kind of eternal hell or anything like that. I doubt that you would say that either hell or heaven, although they may exist, are eternal.<br>CHRISTIAN: Well, there's no such thing as an eternal hell. Absolutely not. That is a super good example of how on earth we like to take the extremes of duality and see how far we could take them. Now millions of people believe in eternal punishment, like holy cow, can we think of something more terrible? <br>Are the limits of our creativity such that we will even come to an experience like earth, or we can try to perceptually get our heads around the idea of eternal punishment? Wow, we'll even consider that idea! That's how bold we are in our expansion. But, as for heaven being eternal; it depends on what you mean by the word heaven. But I will simply say that our true nature is bliss and joy and freedom, and it is eternal.<br>RICK: I think I would establish here is that there's said to be a sort of a very, very subtle relative realm that celestial and then heavenly, and that there are worlds comprised of that, that one could dwell in. But, since they are relative, they are not eternal, but then the self to which you allude, the brahman or the Supreme Self, that is beyond the celestial, it's absolute, and therefore, doesn't come and go. And we all are that always.<br>CHRISTIAN: I agree with that. The eternal self can engage in temporary. Anything, any experience, that is a manifest experience is limited by definition because it's manifest. It won't, it's not forever, because that's not what manifest means. Not what limited means.<br>RICK: Good. Here's an interesting question from Rob in Newburyport, Massachusetts. "Any knowledge about different types of earthly veils? Do we all, regardless of our life's path, have access to our higher self? Or are there paths where the veil is so thick, that any attempt to seek is severely muted, to suit the incarnation purpose?"<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, that's a really good question. I can't say with certainty, but I know that with what I felt in my pre-birth experience that I know the veil is organic and unique to the individual. And it does suit the incarnation purpose. That to me implies at least that a veil could be thicker or thinner. It's pretty crude language, but it implies to me at least that a veil could be purposefully thicker or thinner. In this case, I asked to have a very small amount of memory and I did, that was intentional. <br>They told me it would make this life even more difficult if I did that, had a small amount of memory, and I but I knew that even that contrast was an opportunity for growth. I imagined that in some instances, perhaps even a more rigorous veil would even be helpful, potentially. I don't know for certain. I just know that the veil is not, it's not like a hard rule. It is a personal organic thing. The depth to which we associate with the stories of our life, it is the depth to which we're veiled. <br>Children, when they come in, they're not super associated with any stories yet, so their veil is quite permeable. They'll come and go pretty commonly. But then as they get older and as they learn their identity, and as they get older, and then eventually, it's like, oh, this is all there is. By the time you get to be an adult or an elderly person, you get a whole lifetime of associating with certain earthly ideas and stories that makes the veil be experienced as thicker because that's the nature of it. <br>The more we associate with it, the deeper it feels. But is it ever, like fundamentally obscuring us? No, no, no, no, our true nature is always what it is. The veil can only obscure; it can't actually change what we are. The fact that you're listening right now, and you're conscious means that you exist beyond the veil. Consciousness is already connected to all things. You are already your higher self. The higher self is not someone else; it's you.<br>RICK: Here's a question from Suzanne Stroud in Sugar Land. I guess that's Texas. I think there's a place in Texas called Sugar Land. "In your experience, how can we become more consciously aware of our connection to God? Or the universe?"<br>CHRISTIAN: That question is incredibly personal. It's very difficult to speak to.<br>RICK: Personal meaning it's different for different people?<br>CHRISTIAN: There's so many, because each soul, when we look around at each other, we see a bunch of humans that all look kind of the same. We're all male or female, living our lives and eating food and all that. Souls, every soul is so unique. <br>Every one of us is so incredibly unique and then we've converged into this kind of a shared experience. I say that in the context of the question, because the soul is so unique, and because our experience is so personal, each person's experience with the Divine is very unique, and personal. It's important that we honor that process. <br>I have a short section in the book where I try to give some general points to consider about that. But I'll just make a couple points. One, follow your intuition because the deeper parts of you know whether or not you're willing to look at your own crap enough to see what's actually blocking you from the love and joy of you really are. <br>That's another matter. If you're willing to actually look and listen through intuition. There is guidance there. We're always being guided not only by ourselves, by our nonphysical friends, and, by spirit in general. The second thing is, I'll just mention meditation again because, as you mentioned before Rick, about how meditation helps you not associate so firmly with these dense thoughts, they become less and then it's less of an oppressive grip with each thought. <br>That is a move towards what you really are when you lessen that grip because now you're not as tightly grabbing onto the story. You're letting go. As you let go, what you really are is able to just rise up to the surface on its own and be known. What you really are is divine always, and that process can be very personal. <br>I found it helpful, okay, this is, there's one thing that Tom Campbell said in one of his videos that at the moment, this is like 10 years ago, but really helped me, when he said this one sentence. He said, you're already on the other side of the veil right now. Like, what the heck, really? I am? <br>Wait I don't see that. But, with that in mind, when I meditated, I really became aware it; indeed, I wasn't actually here. So, our own assumptions keep us separated. We believe so much in distance, we believe so much in, I'm this, this is my name. And this is my job. And this is who I am. If we are willing to let go of that and be fully present with exactly what the present moment is, we're not making anything up. There's no need to make up any stories. You don't need new thoughts. You don't need a new belief. Just go and experience what is your loving awareness right now? <br>I think that can be really helpful as one seeks to then experientially find the divine part of themselves. I think the most important thing that I can say is, I just, whoever's listening today, I want to remind you that you're so deeply loved. It's not just a faraway fairytale thing. It's not just a religious belief. There is such a profound universe-shattering love for you specifically. I know when we feel veiled from that. Please, please be reminded of that and maybe even feel some of it within you today because we are not the fearful stories of our lives. <br>We're not. We get wrapped up in these deep roles. I know it's very deep. It's very convincing, but we did, this is a heck of a thing we got going on here in the physical, but it's not really what we are. You have, we all have, permission, not from anybody else, just within yourself, you just have it because you're you to let go of the fear and to feel everything within you and to meet reality with openness and acceptance and joy. That's what we are. If we can even do that a little bit, we will have come a long way.<br><br><br>RICK: Yeah. Do you yourself meditate in some form every day?<br>CHRISTIAN: I do try to meditate every day. I feel, I have periods of time where I feel more deeply called to meditate or not. I can feel if I don't meditate for a while, I become very physically oriented again, and I become lost in the human personality stories again. But I have this little sticky note above my desk that when I was in an experience where I knew it, I wrote to myself, "It is an illusion." <br>I taped it above my desk, and I can't tell you how many hundreds of times I've looked up and gone, "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's an illusion. I forgot again." That's the way it is. We just we get veiled. But I do try to meditate every day to help. Help that awareness. And there's actually nothing more fun in my opinion because there's so much joy in just the aliveness that we are. It's wonderful. I don't always find it as easily. But I do feel it's important to do every day if possible.<br>RICK: Yeah, I agree, and it certainly helped me. I just mentioned it because I can't imagine in my own experience having gone through life without a practice like that. I don't know, where I would have ended up. I was already dropped out of high school and arrested a couple of times and stuff by the time I learned. I don't think I would have lived that long. <br>When you mentioned people going through tough times, I think, well, you definitely need an element in your life that gives you access to that inner reality, whatever you can do to connect with it because it's there. And it's like somebody's begging on the street, and starving and so on, and yet they've actually won the lottery, but they don't realize it. They've got the lottery ticket in a sock drawer or something, and they're still begging. We've all got that lottery ticket, and you can cash it in, but you just have to go through some steps to do.<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: Oh, man, I love what you're saying. It reminds me of the one of my favorite quotes. It's a Rumi quote something to the effect of, "We go from room to room searching for the diamond necklace that is already around our neck." I mentioned meditation, but I want to confirm what you just said, at least from my own perspective that, whatever form it takes for the individual is good, is important because we are in a world of form right now. <br>Not everybody benefits to going straight towards formless awareness. Religion has a great place for many people, if there is a practice, or a discipline, or a learning, a teaching that's helpful, absolutely follow, your intuition. There's different forms that work for different people at different times. That's fine. That's wonderful. I think it's a good process.<br>RICK: Sure. And BatGap is kind of a testament to that. I mean, it's like a smorgasbord of all these different people who followed all these different paths, and arrived at something, gotten some benefit from it.<br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, man, I agree with that your show is amazing. I've really respected your work and told you this, before we started talking. I'll just say publicly that I feel that you're doing amazing work. It's very helpful for people to consider these kinds of perspectives because this doesn't need to be religiously charged conversation. It is, these things are real. To be able to approach it in an intellectual way, and evaluate it, carefully and openly without any kind of dogmatic charges is a big service. I mean, I think Earth going through this awakening right now, and your work is helping, you're a part of that.<br><br><br>RICK: Oh, a little part of it. We're all holding up our sticks. But like you say, it's not a religious thing, and nobody really has to believe in anything in particular. I mean, you can just sort of take it as a hypothesis that maybe some of the stuff these guys are saying is true and let me see if it is. Let me explore a little bit and see if I begin to experience some verification of exactly what they're saying. If I don't then, no big deal, but I do, it could be extremely valuable.<br>CHRISTIAN: Exactly that. I feel strongly in that way too. It's not about getting a new belief or something. It's like, okay, go find out. Is there any merit to this? And if this kind of conversation does...<br>RICK: It reminds me of a quote from the Buddha. He said, "Don't believe anything because anybody says it. Even if I say it, the Buddha. Work it out for yourself and go by your own understanding, your own experience, and prove it or disprove it, but don't take it on faith."<br>CHRISTIAN: Exactly.<br>RICK: Good. Well, I guess that's a good enough note to end on. Well, all right. Thanks so much, Christian. I knew I was going to enjoy talking to you. I certainly enjoyed listening to you many hours by listening to this book. And I'll have a link to it on your page on batgap.com, and people can hop over to Amazon, get it if they want to.<br>CHRISTIAN: I want to interject; I can say that the book is available for free too. It's definitely not about money. It's all on Google Books. You just, if you go to my website, awalkinthephysical.com. Go to the Books page. The third link down is a link to the Google Books entry. Just click read for free. It's all there.<br>RICK: Make sure I have that link too. I can put it on your backup page. Can you download it there? Or do you have to...<br>CHRISTIAN: No, you have to just read it on your screen.<br>RICK: Okay, great. Don't let me forget to make sure I get that link. Oh, wait a minute. One more question came in from Sammy, what does Sammy have to say? Oh, let's read this. This is from Sammy in Aurora. Could be in Aurora, Illinois, I don't know. "How has this awareness affected your closest relationships?"<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: Yeah, that's a good question. It can be very difficult because you see that a lot of relationships are built on a story. I have, I actually have, some rather conservative in-laws, so it has affected my family that way. That's one of my own personal challenges.<br>RICK: You're the wacko son-in-law.<br>CHRISTIAN: I am. That's just how I'm perceived. That's okay. But I feel like there is simultaneously a relationship. There is no need or room for fake relationships very much anymore because it's not necessary. Some relationships can fall away easily. But others can arise, even with what we would call complete strangers that are very deep. I meet people that I would, I just can't believe the beauty of some of these people, and the quality of those relationships is really important. I feel like I'm learning so much. I feel like I'm just at the very beginning. I'm a newbie student. <br>There's so many of these people out there, I have so much to learn from. I really love being able to have those genuine relationships where I can, oh my gosh, there's so many masters out there. Put it that way, there's so many people out there who have mastered certain things. It's beautiful to be able to see past the crap and actually try to engage with those people in that way. It's just a really cool, really cool thing.<br>RICK: Yeah, a lot of spiritual traditions place great emphasis on the importance of the company you keep. They say that if you hang out with the wrong crowd, so to speak, it's going to be an impediment to your spiritual evolution. They really advocate associating with the wise, associating with people who have the kind of values you aspire to. I know, in my own case, when I first learned to meditate, all my friends were taking drugs and so on, and not really going anywhere. I just kind of, it wasn't a big, hard decision. I just kind of gravitated away from them. <br>For quite a few months, I just hung out with the dog and took walks every day, down to the beach. After a while, of course, I accumulated new friends and a whole new life. But people shouldn't be, I've heard, I've actually spoken to people who say, well, I don't want to get too spiritual because I don't want to lose my friends. I want to be, stay on their wavelength, but it really, I don't know. Go ahead. Do you want to comment on that?<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: I really relate to what you're saying. Yeah, it's really important to have. It's interesting because I've thought about how in the nonphysical realities, we do not tend to, so to speak, hang out with those that we don't resonate with.<br>RICK: Like you say, you just walk away if it's not.<br>CHRISTIAN: You just walk away, go over, you resonate. We each resonate with certain things, people, places, energies, and we tend to very naturally gravitate to like attracts like. That old law of attraction thing. In nonphysical systems that happens very quickly. We get together with those who we resonate with very easily. Here on earth, and it can be harder. We have relationships that we can be bound into, or whatever. <br>But it is very important to keep, and it's funny because sometimes you would think, oh, I should stay around this person because maybe I can really help them. But I was just talking to my wife the other day about how important it is to sometimes make distance. If there's someone that you're not resonating with, and they're not being helped by your presence, and you're not, vice versa, it's actually sometimes the better thing to just not spend time with them.<br>RICK: Yeah, tough love. You can't necessarily walk away from your in-laws, you're going to go there for Thanksgiving and have various interactions, but you don't have to be in their face with the kinds of things you like to talk about.<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: We're on the same team. We're 100% on the same team. They're deeply spiritual, faithful people.<br>RICK: Right.<br>CHRISTIAN: And I respect that very much. We're on the same team. There's no, there's not really a conflict, only a perceived conflict.<br>RICK: Right. Sounds like what they're into. They feel like what you're into kind of clashes with their religious beliefs or something.<br>CHRISTIAN: Very much.<br>RICK: But you know it doesn't.<br>CHRISTIAN: I know. Yeah, we're all, it's just a role that we're playing. There's not even a need to, I mean, I do get, my ego gets triggered, but there's not really a need for any conflict because they're just playing their role. They, here we are playing these roles. We're all totally, deeply engaged in the human thing, I get it. That's the way it's supposed to be.<br>RICK: Just tell them you happen to know that Jesus loves you.<br><br><br>CHRISTIAN: And them. I actually thought about, in my 20s, before I went to this awakening, I, there was a period of time when I considered being a Lutheran minister because that was the only way. I sensed something was going on. I didn't know what it was. That was the method to me that at the time seemed the most reasonable. I was very active in my Lutheran Church throughout my life. <br>I was an Assistant Minister for 20 years, I was on the church council, I taught confirmation class. I've experienced a different side of the religious now being the one who is now opposed. Even though I've always been like the church guy, genuinely so, I've always been. Now I have no need to associate with any term. No, affiliation. It's not, that's not required. I mean, I'm okay, I like going. Sometimes we go to church, we go to a Presbyterian church now. I speak at a Unitarian Church. But that's all just, they're all great. It's just form, we get to use it how we wish.<br>RICK: Yeah. And it seems like if your in-laws feel like you've gone astray, you could have deep theological discussions with them. With your background you can quote scripture right and left, and maybe put them at ease. Anyway.<br>CHRISTIAN: Perhaps not, that's okay.<br>RICK: Yeah. Anyway. Okay. Thanks a lot, Christian. It's really great getting to know you, like you were saying you meet these wonderful people. I feel like I've met a wonderful person in meeting you, and hopefully, we'll be in touch from time to time as we go along.<br>CHRISTIAN: I feel the same way about you, Rick. I really appreciate it. Thank you for all the work you do. It's very meaningful.<br>RICK: Well, thanks so much. And thanks to those who've been listening or watching, and we will see you next week. Next week, I'm going to interview a guy named Clay Lomakayu Miller, who is Native American. I haven't interviewed too many Native Americans. There's an upcoming interviews page on BatGap where you can see the other people we have scheduled. Thanks for listening or watching. If you want to go to the BatGap website and poke around, you'll see various things you can do there, and subscribe to the mailing list or the audio podcast and so on. <br>There will be a page on the website about this interview where we'll have a link to Christian's book, both the kind you can buy and the free one that he mentioned. Don't forget to send me that, Christian. You can go to his website, and you probably have some kind of, I know you do a blog where you write different things and thoughts and so on. Do you ever do any kind of like webinar, or private consultations with people or any kind of one-on-one things like that?<br>CHRISTIAN: I'm happy to do one-on-ones, I certainly don't charge anything. I'm happy to help if I can somehow. If anybody would like to email me it's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com</a>.<br>RICK: Great. You could be a little busy after this interview.<br>CHRISTIAN: That's okay.<br>RICK: Good. Anyways, thanks, and we'll be in touch. Thank you, everybody.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2021/christian-sundberg-pre-birth-experience,-incarnation-memory,-purpose-of-life-on-earth-batgap.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2021/Christian Sundberg - Pre-Birth Experience, Incarnation Memory, Purpose of Life on Earth - BatGap.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:02:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Christian Sundberg Talks About Pre-birth Memories, The Purpose Of Life, Suffering, And Is Hell Real]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br><br><br>Hello everyone, I'm Janet Tarantino, the author of Dying to See: Revelations About God, Jesus, Our Pathways, and the Nature of the Soul. I'd like to welcome you today to my YouTube channel called Exploring Everything Spiritual. Please click the like button below, and feel free to share any video on my YouTube channel. Don't forget to subscribe below to hear future amazing stories about everything spiritual.  <br>Our guest today is Christian Sundberg, author of A Walk in the Physical: Understanding the Human Experience Within the Larger Spiritual Context. Let me tell you a little bit about Christian. When Christian was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While his pre-birth memory left him completely during his early adult life, it spontaneously returned at the age of 30 when Christian took up a meditation practice and went through a personal awakening journey. He also began to have out-of-body experiences, known as OBEs.  <br>Now, Christian has given over 80 public speaking presentations in hopes of reminding others, or at least opening their awareness, to who we really are. Welcome, Christian. Glad to have you here today.  <br>Christian: Thank you so much, Janet. I appreciate it.  <br>Janet: My pleasure. I find your story very interesting, as I agree with the pre-birth planning because that's kind of part of my story. I say that because even though I don't have specific pre-birth memories, part of my story goes back to when I was young and had recollections of things I shouldn't have known.  <br>My parents already had twin boys, and they were two years older than me. When I came along, they decided to build a larger home to accommodate the family. I remember that day very clearly because I was about 18 months old, and I still couldn't walk very well. My mom was holding me in the crook of her arm, and my dad had taken us to see the progress of the family home. My dad was animatedly and excitedly describing to my mom where the kitchen appliances and the sink and everything were going to go.  <br>I felt like I was looking out the portholes of this little girl that was me, as if I was the spirit looking out of a porthole of a ship. I already knew what my home was going to look like, with the kitchen being the heart of our home. Does this support what you're going to talk about today?  <br>Christian: Yeah, absolutely. Especially when we're young, the veil is not quite as thick, so to speak. So, it's very common for children to connect to that higher portion of themselves and be able to see from that perspective. It gets a little less common as we become more and more deeply associated with the identity and the forms of Earth. But yeah, that definitely sounds like something I would think is normal.  <br>Janet: Okay, so let's hear a little bit more about what you'd like to share today, and we'll go from there.  <br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, sure. I think the primary message that I want to share, and I think is the most important thing, is that whoever you are listening today, you are loved. You are deeply, deeply loved. And that is not just an abstract, distant concept. It is a tangible, substantive reality, even if you don't necessarily feel it right now on a human level.  <br>What we come from, who we truly are, is total freedom, joy, and unconditional love. It's not just a nice-sounding fairy tale or something. It really is the real substance of what we are. And I'll just have to say up front that these things really cannot be spoken about with words. It's a disclaimer that I think is important to make every time we try to talk about these topics.  <br>We're living in a world right now of form, duality, and symbols. And who we truly are vastly transcends those symbols of Earth. You can't possibly quantify or name or give word to what we really are. So, we're just using some words. Love, joy, and freedom are the closest English words I could think of.  <br>Consciousness itself—who you are—is the spirit that is listening today, not the human character. The human is just something that we experience being. It's like a character that we take on for a while or a shirt that we wear for a while to have a very unique cognitive perspective. But that really is the most important message.  <br><br><br>Of course, there are all sorts of things tied to that, but I really am passionate about hopefully reminding people that they are more than the human character. And because of that, there is nothing to fear. There's nothing in this world that we need to actually fear. Fear is something that we experience very deeply here because this is a very constraining state of separation by comparison. So, there's a lot of opportunity for fear to arise and for the ego to rise because the ego comes from fear.  <br>When we're afraid, when we feel separate, our egos rise up and try to fix the problem. But in the end, there's no reason to fear because even this state of separation is an illusion. It's not fundamentally real. What we really are is consciousness itself, awareness itself, that is connected with all things, with each other, and with all things. We are never truly separate. We are never truly without that power that seems to have been lost. So, there really is never any reason to truly fear.  <br>Janet: Exactly. So, I notice in your book that you mentioned overcoming fear is an important part of the spiritual journey. Is that what you just were talking about?  <br>Christian: Yeah, overcoming fear is a very important part of the journey. I think Tom Campbell's work speaks to this very well. But in short, our true nature is love. So, when we come to an experience like this that is so highly constraining, the experience is giving us an opportunity to integrate this level of context in this specific perspective.  <br>What we are is integrators of experience. That's really what we are. It's really what spirit is. So, when we can come into an experience of extreme separation, extreme denseness, extreme consistency, maybe even extreme pain, and if we can meet that and process that, then there is this incredible growth of being.  <br><br><br>If we can come vibrationally far away from source, from what we really are, and if we can really meet that experience fully and integrate it and come to terms fully with it so that we know it and bring love through it and make loving choices through it, then there is this profound expansion of being—an expansion of what we are, an expansion of love and joy.  <br>So, fear is just a word, but it's the best word we have to summarize that which is not really an opposite of love because love is what's fundamentally real. It doesn't truly have an opposite. But from this perspective in duality, fear is what we could say is love turned around. It's not a second fundamental power, but if we turn it around and if we get lost inside the illusion of separation and if we get lost inside the negative self-perceptions that can arise in this kind of situation—like the perception of powerlessness or shame or unworthiness of love—those are some of the big ones we deal with a lot as humans.  <br>When those negative self-perceptions are taken on, we experience a lot of fear. So, if we can really meet and process and heal that fear, then there is a deep integration that occurs, and that is an expansion of love and joy. So, conquering fear—maybe conquering is not the right word—integrating fear, fully processing fear, fully healing through all that, is synonymous with an expansion of love and joy because joy and love are what we already are.  <br>So, when fear is not hindering us, when we're not buried underneath it, buried underneath all the suffering and the story, then the love that we really are can just shine forth, and it can do it in a context that was previously very daunting. So, yes, it's synonymous with what we're doing here in one way.  <br>Janet: Yeah, I think they call that false fears, false ego appearing real, but it's actually an illusion, like you were saying.  <br>So, I can say that after my near-death experiences, my fear was transformed into excitement because now I wonder every day what's going to happen and what's laid out for me to learn. It's a great mystical adventure here in this world. I remember coming back to my body excited. I was so excited to get back in my body. It was amazing.  <br>Christian: That's awesome. Yeah, I resonate with that because it very much speaks to what I felt before accepting this life, before incarnating. Even though I knew that it was extremely dense and could be extremely challenging for me, there was so much excitement. It was such a precious opportunity to be able to do this, and I was just incredibly excited to be able to undertake this journey.  <br>So, it's really great to hear you say it from a perspective of having already lived, then visiting the other side, and then deciding to return to the existing life in a similar way. That's wonderful. I mean, I feel like when we know the truth of who we really are—the love, the joy, the power, and the immortality of what we really are—it's very natural for us to be excited, even with the things that, from the human perspective, may seem very dense or challenging.  <br>Janet: Yeah, because I sat down in my body. I sat down and put a spirit foot into each of my legs and put my spirit body back on. I rocked back and forth until I could get up enough momentum to lay down in spirit form and help my body sit up and gasp for air.<br>
So, I'm going to hold the suffering for a little bit because I'd like to touch on the purpose of the physical universe. What's that all about?  <br><br><br>Christian: The purpose of this—and we touched on this a bit—is still beyond language. It's almost impossible to state succinctly, but we can say that the physical universe is a place that has been created for the opportunity to make choices within a rich context so that we can integrate experience and grow towards joy and love.  <br>It's an experience integration playground that is meant for the expansion of love and joy. It is also a great creative project. It's like a creative game in which we get to dive deeply into these discrete perspectives and then see how we can actualize our true loving nature through these perspectives. Can we do it even here? And what is it like to experience being this?  <br>This is a place where we can come to experience certain perspectives that are not possible in other higher systems, especially certain limitations. There are certain limitations available on Earth, and not just Earth. The whole physical universe offers the opportunity for experiences of relatively extreme limitation. And that can be very valuable to the spirit, to the soul that wants to experience these things, know them deeply, integrate them deeply, process them, and take that with them forever.  <br>There's so much to that. We summarize the integration experience and the expression of love and the growth of love, which means so many things. Being loved means so many different things. It means how we meet each moment. Do we meet every moment of our lives with openness, acceptance, humility, bravery, compassion, and kindness? Or do we feel the fear and then just kind of...  <br>And it's okay if we find ourselves unable to escape the fear circle. That's okay. That's part of the journey. But if we can overcome that fear, like we said already, then that is such an awesome opportunity.  <br>So, that's a part of it too because, basically, if we want to bring it down to just one root idea, it's how we use our intent. We're refining the way that we use our intention, our choice-making. Tom Campbell has a great term for this. He calls it "quality of intent." It means, in any given context, can you make the loving choice rather than the fearful choice?  <br>And so, this universe is a high-constraint, high-contrast context in which we get to test that and develop it.  <br>Janet: Great. So, in your view, do we incarnate because this one's been floating around in my mind? Do we learn for us as spirits, or do we learn for the collective, or both?  <br>Christian: It's like that, yes. But the learning is not intellectual learning or behavioral learning. Those things happen within a given life. The learning that we're doing is experiential growth. It's a growth of the being.  <br>So, reincarnation doesn't mean different people. It's just that you—whoever you are listening—that feels like you to you is knowing this experience, and you will know future experiences too if you so choose because it's valuable to have different experiences.  <br>We very crudely might say you can go do one thing Monday night, another thing Tuesday night, and another thing Wednesday night. They're all you. You're just learning and having a different experience. Maybe you go to dinner one night, maybe you go hiking, and then maybe you go to a movie. They may all be very different experiences, but it's still you having them.  <br>Kind of like, where is the five-year-old you right now? The five-year-old you is gone. It's died, so to speak. That form is gone, but you're still here. And it will be exactly the same when the body is gone too. It doesn't matter if it's five or sixty or buried in the ground. Your consciousness will remain seamlessly passed.  <br>In fact, in that state, once the body is gone, the constraints are lifted, so you're much more free. But it's still you. And so, if you choose to have future experiences, that's great if you wish to do that.  <br>Janet: Yeah, I took care of my parents during their last five years of their life. There was one night, one afternoon, I came into the living room. My mom was in her recliner, and she was a strong Lutheran. Reincarnation was not in her sphere of religion.  <br>She sat up in her chair and said, "I finally get it." I said, "What do you mean?" She said, "We're eternal beings because we go in and out and in and out." I said, "You mean reincarnation?" She said, "Yeah."  <br>Later on that day, she said, "They're showing me naked bodies—naked bodies of men and naked bodies of women." So, I believe she was picking out her next body during that afternoon.  <br><br><br>Christian: Interesting. Yeah, we do pick our lives. I've shared this in other videos at length. I think it's important to speak to other topics too, so if someone's interested, they can look up my other videos. But yes, I remember choosing this life and knowing it in great detail beforehand.  <br>I knew that it would very much help fulfill an intention I had for growth—a specific intention in my case to process a deep fear that had bested me in previous experiences. I knew this experience would be very valuable for that. So, we do choose.  <br>I was aware of my parents, for instance. I was aware of many things of the context of the life. In fact, I reviewed millions and millions of possibilities that might happen in this life. So, yeah, we do review ahead of time.  <br>Janet: Yeah, my daughter was in my first near-death experience when I was 15. During my third near-death experience, I was told they were showing me these moments in my life—some were in the future that hadn't happened yet—and I was told to understand these moments because they matter.  <br>When I started to sit down and analyze all these things and then wrote about all of it, the beautiful lady in the music box—I also thought of her as Daddy's little girl at one point because she had moved up in a way, and I thought Daddy was putting her up on a pedestal—but it was many years later that I looked at my daughter's picture, and it was exactly what I drew of that time frame. So, she was coming because that was my first near-death experience. She had come to make sure I got back in my body so that she could be born 15 years later.  <br><br><br>So, yeah, higher time and linear time—I don't understand how they interrelate, but they're not the same.  <br>Christian: Yeah, I know that the viewers are very interested in what you have to say about hell. Can you go into that a little bit?  <br>Christian: Yeah, so we experience hellish experiences on Earth and in certain non-physical reality systems potentially due to our own fear. So, it's not that there is a fundamental place called hell, just like there's not a fundamental place called Earth. There's an experience of form, an experience of Earth, or an experience of another reality system that is thought-responsive.  <br>In both cases, form is not the fundamental thing. Consciousness, spirit, is the fundamental thing. And so, if consciousness has not yet evolved to meet a certain constraint set optimally with love, then fear will be present. And when there's fear, fear can give rise to all sorts of hell—both for others through fearful choices, hateful or egoic choices, and also for the self because fear is a hell.  <br>Living in fear is a hell. It is painful, and it can actualize things in one's life experience that can be hellish. The context itself on Earth is not a hell. It's actually neutral, even though there may be very rigorously extreme moments of sensation. We apply the meaning to what we experience on Earth. So, it is through our own fearful interpretation and the fearful stories and the ego that we suffer.  <br>And that can also be true in a non-physical environment that is thought-responsive. If someone brings a lot of fear and negative expectation or negative belief into that environment, the environment can rise up in a way that reflects that quite quickly, immediately.  <br><br><br>It's interesting because on Earth, we very rarely talk about the importance of belief and expectation, and it's very important because we are powerful creators. So, let's just take an example of the belief in hell—the belief in eternal punishment. That's one heck of a dualistic belief. We're really working with the most fearful type of beliefs we can think of, and people really believe in it.  <br>Then they take that belief with them, and they may almost inadvertently, for a time at least, actualize quite hellish environments because of that belief. But fortunately, we are guided and helped. So, if we are assisted and generally speaking, we will be assisted and shown that we are creative, we are powerful. We don't have to focus on the negative. We don't have to believe in that. We have the power to choose what we wish to believe and how we wish to use reality.  <br>And that's true not only there, it's true here. We don't have to choose to meet our lives in fear. We don't have to choose the path of suffering, even if there's pain. And I'm not saying it's easy. I've had tons of physical pain in my life, and I know I'm not making light of it. But we apply the meaning. We choose the beliefs.  <br>There is no belief that you really, really, really need to grip onto with white knuckles. You get to choose how you interact with even your own beliefs, and you are free to do that and to choose how to interpret life. It seems like you can't when you have a lifetime of momentum built up in a certain direction. Our parents teach us a certain way of interpretation, and then as we grow, it becomes who we are.  <br>And then reality itself appears that way. That's the thing about Earth—one of the things about Earth that's very interesting is that what we believe about it, it seems that reality itself is that way. It's like a big mirror that reflects back to us what we believe about it and about ourselves.  <br><br><br>If we believe that we're not worthy of love, for instance, we will see all sorts of evidence that we're not worthy of love. We will actualize all sorts of events that show us that we're not worthy of love. And we're doing it almost without knowing.  <br>So, yeah, I think it's very important that we focus, that we become aware of how important our own beliefs and expectations are so that we don't create a hellish situation for ourselves or for others. So, we can choose to create a better future.  <br>And it takes a little bit of effort because you do have to constantly think about changing your old viewpoints and manifesting them into a new point of view, kind of like doing a vision board and trying to create a new future.  <br><br><br>Christian: Right. Yes, we absolutely do have the power to create a better future. I don't simply want to make it sound like an action, though. It's not that we need to just perform one action to manifest a better future. The most important thing we can do is to grow in love and face our own fear. If we do that at the deepest level, then the deepest part of us will automatically be resonating with that and helping to create that.<br>
A lot of people will create some type of manifestation tool, like a vision board, and they say, "I want this certain thing," and they say it in their mind, but what their energy is really saying is, "I'm afraid of not getting that thing." There's a difference. And so, what the universe is listening to is not primarily the surface thought. It's primarily your deepest intention—what's really going on inside you.  <br>I've heard it described like a soundboard. I kind of like this metaphor. Each one of us is like a board, not just one pitch, but producing hundreds of pitches or something all at once. Each person is very complex. So, I'm putting it that way because it's not just that we focus intentionally on positive outcomes, but I would like to look even deeper and focus on the root.  <br>What is your deepest fear? Where is the ego arising from? And what can you do to heal your own fear and to own your own crap? It's not about avoiding your own stuff. It's about going towards your own stuff, and that takes a lot of humility, a lot of courage, a lot of work, so to speak.  <br>He said it takes effort because we need to be willing to really own ourselves. It's not so much that we each need to worry about changing the world. If we focus on growing ourselves towards love, conquering our own fear, then we will very naturally be a part of the solution. And that's something we can each do.  <br>Work on yourself. Don't worry so much about the whole world. You don't have control over the whole world anyway, but you are responsible for what's in you. So, focusing there can be very, very powerful.  <br>Janet: So, it's accepting the responsibility of who you are and what you do, basically.  <br>Christian: Yeah, and knowing that you can do that without fear because it's not just like, "Oh, when you go look at who you are, you see, 'Oh man, I'm a big mess.'" It's okay. It takes humility to see that you're a big mess. That's fine. Go down and find what is the actual fear. What really are the negative self-perceptions you're holding onto? Feel them—not the story. You can think about the story later. Let yourself feel what's within you because, underneath all of it, at the deepest, deepest, deepest level, you are love.  <br>You are not a fearful story. You are not shameful. You are not powerless. You are not unworthy of love. You are love.  <br>Janet: Wonderful. So, people often ask, are demons real? And are evil spirits real? If we're all love, which we are, then what are demons and evil spirits about?  <br>Christian: Okay, so they're breaking into two categories. First of all, our thoughts have momentum in thought-responsive realities. So, things that we think and expect and believe here have a tangible mass to them in higher systems, in the astral plane.  <br>So, on Earth, just believing in something called a demon and having images associated with it and ideas gives life to a thought form that is what we've been thinking about demons. And that can actually be experienced in a non-physical system. You can interact with thought objects.  <br>In this first instance, is that a really free-willed being? No, it's not. But it can be very real, very tangible. You can even interact with it. It's a form, but it's not a free-willed form. So, I'm just pointing that as one category.  <br>I'm not an expert. I'm just saying this is the way I understand that we give rise to thought forms—not just negative thought forms, but all sorts of thought forms. Take just the idea of Santa Claus. Millions of people have put a lot of energy into this idea, and when you say Santa Claus to a small child, I feel like they almost just ping the database and get a connection with that. They can already sense what's the energy of that idea, and they haven't even interacted with it.  <br>Or they see one image of the man in red, and they feel that feeling of Santa Claus. So, we do that with negative beliefs too.  <br>Okay, so that's the first category. The second category is, are there beings that are free-willed and choice-making personalities like you and I who are demonic?  <br>Well, the thing is, the question really is, is fear-based decision-making possible? Yeah, it's possible. I mean, there's fear-based decisions happening on Earth right now. But are those people love at the very root? Absolutely, they are love at the very root.  <br>Similarly, it is possible in systems of form, even certain thought-responsive systems, for there to be fear-based intention being wielded. And where that is, it's possible for what we might call a negative interaction.  <br>But again, who is the soul playing that character in that system? We like to think of the other side as like one other place, like we're human or no, we are the soul. We're the higher self who plays characters in many different systems.  <br>And if it's a system of high constraint, relatively high constraint, and if it's an experience that has not been yet fully integrated, and if the being is carrying a lot of fear in that personality, then it's possible that fearful choices can be made that could hurt others.  <br>So, I don't think we need to focus on that whole idea too much, though, because it's transient. It doesn't have true power. And like here in the physical world, it is possible for someone to kick in your front door with a gun and take physical power over you.  <br>Okay, but what is that real power? No, it's not real power. The only power that fear has is in the local, very limited sense. It's just a play. It's a dream. And beyond that, it has almost no power at all. The true power is love.  <br>So, similarly, fear-based intention, even in other systems, is very limited. It's not the true power. It's like a twisted, temporarily twisted something occurring within a given server. It doesn't have true power. True power is life itself, spirit itself—the love, joy, peace, freedom, and goodness of what is at the root of all beings everywhere.  <br>And it's good for us to focus on that. That doesn't mean ignore the places that need to be healed, but it does mean that we do not need to fear those things. In fact, when we encounter negativity like that, it can be very important for us to meet with love and fearlessness.  <br>You know, like one person once asked Tom Campbell—I'm a big fan of Tom Campbell; he's a physicist and consciousness explorer—someone asked him once, "Well, what should I do? I wanted a body, and I saw this demonic figure." And he said, "Give it a hug."  <br>And it's not just a quaint comment. It means overcome your own fear. It very well may just be a thought object, but if you meet it with love, fear can't. It has no true power. So, if you meet it with love, then that is powerful.  <br>Janet: Christian, you mentioned out-of-body experiences. Can you tell us a little bit about your OBE experiences and what you learn while you're out of body?  <br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, so I consider my out-of-body experiences quite limited. I've had a number of them. They happen occasionally. They're much less alien now. When I first had my first non-physical experience, it was ridiculously jarring and worldview-altering—scary, you know, like it really freaked me out because it's so real. It's not like a dream or something.  <br>I have different kinds of experiences occasionally. Sometimes, I will be meditating, and I will enter a state that I would describe as non-local, like I'm everywhere. The body is just like one point that's within me, and I'm huge. It's just I'm not the body. The body is happening within me, and I feel it tangibly.  <br>Other times, my body may be asleep, and I may engage like if I start an elusive dream that I find is a good stepping platform to go from. And I might experience certain environments that are just breathtakingly beautiful. The colors are so alive and so rich, and you're a part of them, and they're part of you.  <br>I mean, I feel like there's one where I remember looking at the green of the grass in this one reality, and I was like, "The grass is so green. I feel like I could just stand here and look at the grass all day, and it would be the most wonderful experience you can imagine—just looking at the grass because it was so green."  <br>So, that type of experience is possible. And I've had certain instances where I've met people that I know physically who are alive in a non-physical environment. And when I do, I like to try to—this is just a little hobby or something—but I like to try to prove it the next day that we actually met in the non-physical environment.  <br>So, usually, I try to get their attention and try to get us to remember some things that I call them in the morning. They can tell us. It works sometimes. I've had four successes so far. I probably had five or six failures. That's okay.  <br>The successes are just to my own satisfaction. It's not like a scientific study or something. But I find that very fun, and now it's very normal to me. I don't feel like, "Oh my gosh, wow, that's such a special thing." It's very normal.  <br>All of us actually engage the non-physical very commonly. We do it, I feel, when the body is asleep. It is very common for us to venture out, and it's just because of the veil that we tend not to remember it. The veil is pretty good at keeping us focused on just the earthly context and the earthly personality.  <br>I feel it is very likely that when we pass and when the veil is lifted, we will become aware of many more activities that we participated in while we were alive and sleeping, maybe even when we're not sleeping potentially, that we just didn't remember at the time.  <br>Janet: So, you mentioned the veil. Can you explain exactly what the veil is?  <br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, so the veil is a heavy one. It's just hard to have language to describe it, but I think the simplest way we can put it is it's a consciousness technology.  <br>What I mean is, your consciousness pre-exists. It exists before the human experience. I know you may not remember before the human experience, but that's why you don't remember because we have to agree to be bound to the constraints of the physical experience—the biology, the linear time, and the discrete location. And those constraints are what we call the veil.  <br>And when I accepted the veil for this life, it was like being at a place of very, very high vibration where I was connected to everything, and I had all knowledge available to me. And I like to describe it like an amplifier—a sound amplifier that produces a pitch.  <br>And then you turn it down when the veil comes over. It goes down, and then when it gets to the bottom, you just keep turning lower, lower, lower, more lower, lower.<br>That's what it felt like. Just this ridiculously huge drop in vibration and having all my knowing be cut off. Having all my connectedness be cut off. Feeling all all of a sudden very alone and in the dark and super dense. The body is so dense like a heavy metal object and being feeling alone.<br>So, the veil is a consciousness technology. It’s what allows us to have this very dense, constrained experience here on Earth. When I accepted the veil for this life, it felt like a massive drop in vibration. I went from being connected to everything, having all knowledge available to me, to feeling very alone, in the dark, and dense. The body is so dense, like a heavy metal object or something.  <br>So, the veil is just that. I like to call it a technology that facilitates this experience of denseness so that we can integrate this type of experience. It’s an additive, facilitative creation.  <br>Janet: So, did you feel the sound going down when you entered your body? Do you think the physical body is the veil that separates us?  <br>Christian: The veil is in consciousness space. The physical body is not a fundamentally real thing. The physical body is an experience. It feels like a real thing—it’s close enough—but it’s an experience happening on and within consciousness. So, the veil is something that applies to consciousness itself.  <br>It’s necessary for consciousness to surrender part of itself to the veil because the spirit is sovereign. It’s all-powerful, part of Source. There’s no greater authority, so it has to allow itself to be veiled. It’s like a subset of the self that is being wrapped within an organic blanket of restriction. That’s kind of what we might say the veil is like.  <br>So, it’s not a physical thing. However, it is very much associated with the physical body and with the limitations of being physical. When the body passes, the limitations immediately relinquish because the veil is part of what allows the actualization into the physical form. So, they are tied together somehow.  <br>If you modify the physical brain, you might change the constraints of the veil in certain ways, but the veil is still on you as a consciousness.  <br>Janet: I said I was going to wait to talk about why bad things happen to good people. People always say, “Why do bad things happen?” But that is for our experiential experience, right?  <br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, so we are so loved that we are permitted to enter and experience a context in which fearful choices are possible. It’s not that we’re being punished or something. It’s that we have entered into an extreme level of constraint, and now we’re all operating from ego. And when we do that, we hurt each other. So, a lot of bad things happen.  <br>Some pain is associated strictly with just being physical at times. If you get stabbed, you’re going to have a physical sensation. But like I said, even that is neutral. You get to assign a meaning to it.  <br>But all of that contrast is valuable. The entire system is a creative tool. Think of it that way. Contrast is a way that spirit can know experientially certain depths, and when it does that, it is an expansion in being.  <br>For instance, how can the spirit know what total freedom means except that it chooses to know not freedom for a while? Well, now that it knows that, it really knows it. If you come into the human experience, you really know what it’s like to be you. You really know it. It’s not a joke. You are really you. So, whatever perceptions and experiences you’re having, that acts as a very valuable point of perspective that is very helpful and additive to the totality of the soul.  <br>So, I’m saying that in the context of the question because even the great challenges of life can potentially be very beneficial and additive, especially if we allow them to be. Especially if we allow ourselves to grow through them rather than just wail and rage. And I know it’s not easy. Wailing and raging is what the ego does, and it seems like there are many contexts that very much deserve that. I’m not making light of that.  <br>I’m just saying that all experience, even though very constraining and high-contrast situations of life, have the potential to be very high-growth, useful, even very loving, wonderful experiences, depending on how we use them.  <br>Janet: And so, we choose these growth factors, correct? That’s what you’re into?  <br>Christian: Yeah, we choose. We choose a life context. In my case, I chose to engage a very specific fear. So, yes, in my case, I chose to be challenged in a very, very specific, deep way.  <br><br><br>Absolutely. And I suffered post-traumatic stress disorder for seven or eight years after a trauma at the age of 22, which was foreseen. I didn’t know it at the time because my pre-birth memory had left me by the age of five or six. So, when I was 22, I didn’t know. But before I was born, I knew that this was very likely to happen, and it was a really exciting opportunity to re-engage this very low vibration and to see if I could process it, meet it, integrate it, and do that.  <br>And I knew there was so much growth and just huge potential available even through that, that I was excited to have the opportunity, even though I knew it would be very difficult potentially. And it was plainly seen. It was known it would be very challenging.  <br>But we’re so ambitious and creative and desiring to grow in love and joy and in our creativity that we sometimes do bite off a lot. So, anyway, we do plan certain things. Not every single thing, but there are usually themes that run through the life. If there’s some kind of revisiting perception or revisiting challenge that seems to be constantly with us, and by the time we’re to a certain age, we’re just freaking sick of it, and we’ve got to deal with it.  <br>Not always, but sometimes that is the thing that we came to deal with.  <br>Janet: Yeah, that’s true. When I was four, I had another experience. I was with my mom, and she was talking about adoption on the phone with somebody. I was bored because I wasn’t in school yet. I was too young, so I was waiting for everybody to come home from school.  <br>When she got off the phone, I asked her if I was adopted because I still had a sense that there was something bigger that I was missing and that this wasn’t my real family. But she said, “No, you’re our little girl.” But then I told her, “Okay, but I’m going to die young.”  <br>And when I said that, I had visions of three ages go through in my mind, and those were the three ages I had my three near-death experiences. So, I was seeing portions of what was planned ahead for me. Lord knows why I chose that kind of life. I obviously chose it for a reason, and I think it was for the book that I was told to write too.  <br>Christian: Yeah, awesome. Yes, thank you for doing that. It’s been a very real and amazing journey that you signed up for.  <br>Janet: And you talk of the out-of-body experiences. My dad, during his final days, woke up one morning, came out to the living room, hobbling with his walker, and he said he was looking confused. I said, “Are you okay?” And he said, “I don’t know. I just came back. I just flew back through a tunnel. I was standing with some people in a white area, and then I flew back over the fields and through a tunnel.”  <br>And he said, “I just don’t know what’s going on.” But he had come back to his body before he passed.  <br>Christian: That’s so awesome. Yeah, we kind of explained that to him, and it made sense. I feel like I miss that so much when I hear that. I just get it. It was fascinating. I feel my own ego respond, but no, that’s really beautiful.  <br>Janet: So, is there anything else that you’d like to touch on that’s important for our audience to know?  <br>Christian: Yeah, I think we already touched on a lot of very important points, but one thing I’ll just say is this thing about you not being human. The life that you’re experiencing right now is a story and an opportunity.  <br>So, this is just another comment about the idea that you don’t need to be afraid of your life or what the world is offering you. But specifically, we tend to have a relationship with the story of our life, and I think it’s very powerful if we can learn to take a step back.  <br><br><br>Meditation can be extremely helpful for this—not because you’re trying to escape the story, but meditation is helpful just because as you spend time with your awareness itself and not thinking, you grow in familiarity with your awareness itself, and the thinking loses its oomph.  <br>This is very important. It’s very meaningful and liberating because as we do that, we find that we aren’t the constant thought stream. It’s not what we are. Thoughts are like little dreams that are hitting you in the face all day.  <br>Dream, dream, dream. Gotta do this, gotta pay this bill, this person said this to me, I don’t feel good, I want to eat chicken fingers—whatever the thoughts are, they’re just constantly arriving in your mind. But while you’re doing that, you’re asleep in this constant thinking rather than being fully alert and aware.  <br>So, as you learn to work with your own story, take a moment to just be fully alert and aware in your life. I call that mindfulness, but allow yourself to be mindful of whatever context you’re in—washing your hands, putting on your clothes, talking to somebody, or just looking at the sky.  <br>Give yourself permission every once in a while to put down all the thinking and put down all the stories and just be present. Just be fully alert and aware, and when you do that, it naturally clears the leaves away, and the deeper parts of yourself can rise up on their own.  <br>And that is a most beautiful thing because if you even get the smallest, tiniest, teeniest little glimmer of the pure peace and joy of what you really are, it fills you with strength, and it helps you to meet not just that moment or that hour or that day but really your life with more love, more joy, more freedom, more openness.  <br>And when we can do that, that’s awesome. So, just to comment, don’t worry about the story. All the things in your life seem so serious, but it’s okay to open your hands and put them down.  <br>I like saying it’s like we’re in a play right now on a stage as actors, and we’re carrying around these heavy rocks everywhere we go, and they’re keeping us on the stage. These rocks are our association with the thoughts and the story.  <br>But we think they’re really important, so we keep holding onto them every day. We trudge along, holding these heavy rocks every day. But you have complete and total permission, no matter how important they seem, to put them down. And when you do, there is a peace and a lightness that can return to you on its own.  <br>Anyway, I just think that’s an important thing to say.  <br>Janet: And do you have a special meditation practice you use, one particular way, or does it matter how you meditate just as long as you go within?  <br><br><br>Christian: Well, different people will benefit from different practices. I do have one practice that works for me. I share it in part four of my book. By the way, my book is available for free. It’s not about money. I want it to be available for everybody.  <br>If you’re interested, my website is walkingthephysical.com. I have a book page. The third link down is a link to the Google Books entry for the book. Just click “Read for Free” on the Google Books page, and it’s all there.  <br>In part four, I describe the meditation exercise that’s really helped me. It seems very simple on the surface, but the action itself is not the active ingredient. What’s important is your intention.  <br>So, I like to just pick a simple shape in my mind, like a square, and trace my attention with full attention along the shape without breaking my focus on the shape. And then thoughts will come, and that’s okay. And then I come back and continue.  <br>The idea is you’re using your intent to not pay so much attention to these super important thoughts but to focus on something neutral that you’re choosing. And as you do that over time, it can be very empowering because then, eventually, when the thoughts are not arriving, the momentum of the water has slowed, and you can drop the object of focus and just be present.  <br>Feel what it is to be alive. Feel the awareness. Feel the aliveness in your body. Just dwell in it. Don’t judge. No story. Just be alive. And I find that to be an incredibly empowering, liberating process.  <br>It helps to eliminate all the stress from the day too. It’s a cleanser. It also feels very good because if you truly can even touch a bit of that view beneath the thinking, it’s full of joy and peace always, no matter what.  <br>And it’s just so worth doing. I like the sentence, “You should meditate for half an hour a day unless you don’t have time, and then meditate for an hour.” Or maybe it’s, “Meditate for an hour a day unless you don’t have time, and then meditate for two hours.”  <br>I like that because it’s like, you don’t have time to go find peace and to feel good? It takes practice, though, and you don’t approach it with some expectation. You just do it with openness, full humility, and allow yourself to do it over time.  <br>I found that after just a few months of really being committed to meditation, that was really what opened this awakening for me. I started having non-physical experiences. I wasn’t trying. I was just meditating, and I started having non-physical experiences. My pre-birth memory started arising very naturally. It wasn’t like a big epiphany. It was just like it was always there, and now suddenly I could see it again.  <br>But more important than that, it’s not important that you have these amazing experiences. It’s not what it’s about. What’s important is that you find the peace and the joy and the love that you are because that’s wonderful. And then you can share it with others, and that’s wonderful.  <br>It’s a process for which the rewards are not immediately apparent. You sit down and meditate for an hour, and then you do it a few times, and you’re like, “I don’t know. I was doing it, but...” Most people don’t have the patience or the persistence to do it.  <br>But the rewards are very real. Don’t judge it too quickly. Just set aside time, like for three months, and say, “I’m going to meditate for 40 minutes a day.” And then don’t even judge it until after the few months. Then you can think about it.  <br>Just think of it as your own bubble bath—your own “me time.”  <br>Janet: Yeah, you say bubble bath because a bubble bath is one of those situations where you are in “me time,” but it’s also a release and letting go—a place to put aside all the thoughts and be present with the warm water and the sensation of this place.  <br>It’s the same in a way. Of course, you may still be focused on thinking, but I just mean it’s similar in that it is a state of non-resistance and acceptance of the present moment, which can be done anywhere and at any time.  <br>Christian: Yeah, true. Either out in nature or at home in your bedroom or in the corner—whatever is more convenient for the person.  <br>Janet: So, Christian, this is wonderful, and I have no doubt that your story is giving the listeners much to ponder. I’m so thankful and grateful that you’ve agreed to be here today. So, I’m honored.  <br>Christian: Thank you, Janet. Thank you very much for being back. And whoever is listening today, thank you for being human. Yeah, I know it sounds strange because that’s all you remember—being human. But you are very brave to be here. You’re doing it. You are a brave, powerful spirit who will even do this. You’re here. You’re doing it. It’s awesome.  <br>So, congratulations. And whoever you are listening, thank you for doing this today, for being you.  <br>Janet: Wonderful. So, you’ve already mentioned that your website is walkingthephysical.com, and your email is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:walkingthephysical@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:walkingthephysical@gmail.com" target="_blank">walkingthephysical@gmail.com</a> if people would like to reach out.  <br>Yeah, so I’ll put all of Christian’s information and the link to the free book in the description area under the video, and you can reach out to him if you choose and enjoy his book. It has tons of wonderful information because I’ve already dove in, I guess you could say. So, grab it and use it to make your future a better place and a better life.  <br>As we head out for the day, I like to ask you to wake up each day with a sense of wonder on where you’ll be guided and what you’ll be shown and who will be placed in your pathway for you to learn from because life is the most mystical, magnificent adventure of souls working with souls that you’ll ever have.  <br>Have a great day, everybody. Bye!  <br>Christian: Bye!]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2021/christian-sundberg-talks-about-pre-birth-memories,-the-purpose-of-life,-suffering,-and-is-hell-real.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2021/Christian Sundberg Talks About Pre-birth Memories, The Purpose Of Life, Suffering, And Is Hell Real.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:02:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Christian Sundberg's Pre-Birth Visions]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=jIamDe4l1N4  <br>20 SEP 2021<br><br><br>The International Association for Near-Death Studies presents NDE Radio, a weekly exploration of near-death experiences and similar encounters with the other side. Now, here's your host, Lee Witting.  <br>Welcome to NDE Radio. I'm your host, Lee Witting. Our guest today, Christian Sundberg, has the unusual ability to remember certain aspects of his pre-birth existence, giving us some clues to our pre-birth state before we accepted the veil of forgetfulness, which seems to be a condition for living our human lives. When Christian was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While that memory left him completely for his early adult life, it spontaneously returned 11 years ago as Christian took up a meditation practice and went through a personal awakening journey. He also began to have out-of-body experiences.  <br>Christian now often speaks publicly as he seeks to remind others, at least in a small part, of who we really are beneath the human play. Professionally, Christian has worked for 15 years as a project manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing projects. Christian is the author of the book A Walk in the Physical, which attempts to succinctly describe the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey. At the heart of the book is the theme of love, and it describes why authentic love, even in small matters, is so deeply important to our human journey. Christian, welcome to NDE Radio.  <br>Thank you. It's an honor to be here.  <br><br><br>Oh, it's an honor to have you, Christian. Most folks envision their birth as a human on Earth as their beginning, as a starting point, whereas, from your experience, you realize we've already lived a complex, loving, wisdom-filled existence on the other side. I believe your story will come as a real enlightenment to some of our listeners, so I'd like you to just go ahead and tell your story, and I'll try not to interrupt with questions until later on.  <br>Oh, no problem. Thank you, Lee. Please do interrupt if something comes up. Okay, so I'm going to attempt to describe this, but I really have to disclaim first that our true natures are so much bigger than anything we can put words on. You know, human language is inherently limited. It's specific to our local experience here on Earth, and we live in a world of duality. Our nature, our true nature, our spiritual nature, transcends that duality. So it's pretty much impossible to try to take some words from Earth and use them to depict something which transcends those words. I just have to say that up front because it's very important to understand that it can't be limited in the way that we try to depict with language.  <br>Okay, so that being said, and I understand some of this may sound a bit strange to some people, but I'm just going to share, and then, of course, please ask questions if any of this compels a question. But I remember a long time ago, before I was ever physical, coming across a being who had been physical. I'll just say before I go into it that I remember this was a young child before the age of five or six, and this memory left me completely by the age of six. It returned around the age of 30 or so when I took up a meditation practice, like you mentioned. But I used to think on these memories when I was a small child, and I used to draw upon them. I assumed everybody just kind of knew that we weren't from here, that this is just a neat place for coming to visit and having a neat experience. But nobody else talked about it, so I just kind of kept it to myself.  <br>Anyway, a long time ago, I remember coming across this being who had had physical experiences, and this was before I had had any physical incarnations at all. I remember being completely and totally inspired by the quality of this being's essence or nature when I came across him. I could feel, because in that reality system where I was, there's a sharing of being where you can feel telepathically what the other person is thinking and who they are. When I engaged this being, I felt this joy and this power and this incredible quality of substance of what he was, what he had become. And I said, "My goodness, how did you become this? What could you possibly have done to be this? And do you really feel this much joy and power and love that I feel you feel?"  <br>And he shared with me, yes, he felt in the depths of his being who he really was. He shared with me that he had lived physical lives, and he shared one in particular in which he had had a chronic pain or health condition that was very difficult for him for many years, something he could not easily physically escape. But the way that he met that experience with acceptance and humility and love allowed a certain refinement of who he was. It allowed an expansion and a deepening of who he really was.  <br>And I asked him, "My goodness, were you healed?" because I could see how badly he had felt damage in this physical life. He shared, yes, and I felt the depth of the healing deep into his being. And I said, "I want to do this. I'm going to do it. I am going to do this." I was totally inspired. I said, "I will do this." And he said something like, not brushing me off, but in a playful way, almost like, "Yeah, that's what they all say. It's hard in a way that you don't know." And I said, "No, I mean it. I'm gonna do it." He said, "Well, then go talk to your guides."  <br>So I did right after that, but I know that I lived many times, and then I went and found this being later and shared with him something to the effect of, "See, I'm in the process of doing this now." I wasn't all the way there, but I was growing and learning, and he was very encouraging when I found him again.  <br>Okay, so now I'm going to jump a bit, and the sequence is difficult to describe here because this is not linear time. But the majority of what I remember is in a time that is somewhat immediately preceding this life, where I had taken a long break. I had lived physically and taken a very long period of relaxation and rest. I remember this guide coming to me over and over again, asking me, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready yet?" I kept putting him off over and over, saying, "No, I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready. I'm just going to rest. I'm just going to have fun."  <br>Eventually, he kept reminding me of my own intention, and eventually, I said, "Okay, I'm ready now." And then I reviewed with this guide what I can only describe as my state or who I am and who I have been. It was like reviewing a complex set of qualities and things that I knew experientially, not intellectual learning, because all knowledge is there already. But I'm talking about qualities of being that I had experienced and that I had either developed or not.  <br>It was very easy to identify the thing I needed to work on. I don't like the word "work on" because it's not quite the right language, but the thing that it would be best for me to experience and engage again. The best way I can describe it is that it was a very low-vibration fear, a fear that had bested me in a previous physical experience. In that previous physical experience, the fear had led me into a place where I was a very damaging person to others. In that experience, I was very hurtful, and I also hurt a lot myself. In that life, I ended up dying a physically painful death.  <br>This fear was something to the effect of being unable to escape pain and being afraid of that, and also being too proud to be stuck in a state of pain. This fear had really overcome me. So I remember reviewing the depth of this fear and even then recognizing very objectively, "Wow, this is extremely low vibration. Can this even be done? Is it possible to integrate an experience of this vibration, this lowness?"  <br>The being shared with me, yes. I asked, "Has it ever been done? Like, in all of creation, has anybody ever engaged something at this extreme in this way?" And I was shown yes. I was told, "And you have all of time available to you to do so. There's no hurry." And from that perspective, I knew, "Well, if it can be done, then I will do it." Which sounds strange to me as the human because I have very difficult moments like everybody else, but at the time, I just knew with incredible confidence because I knew who I really was, what we really are. I knew that I was immortal and free, and no harm could truly follow me. I knew my great strength, and I said, "Then if it can be done, I will do it."  <br>So they brought me a life, a lifetime that was very appropriate for that purpose, to re-engage this fear. That lifetime was not this current lifetime; it was just before this one. I remember reviewing this life that they had brought me and accepting the life. And then I remember accepting the veil. This is the thing that I remember the most, and I think about this almost every day. This process of surrendering the total knowing and connectedness of what I really am so that I could be obscured and have this very specific local vantage point.  <br><br><br>It was extremely shocking and jarring. It was like diving down a huge slide or diving into a swimming pool and diving down, down, down, down. I like to describe it like an amplifier that makes a pitch, like a knob, and then you turn down the knob. The volume and the vibration plummet, and then when you get to the bottom, you turn it down more, lower, lower, lower, lower, some more, lower, lower, more, lower still, lower more. That's how it felt to plummet all the way down from this connectedness and love and freedom of what I really was, down into this place of being physical and in the womb.  <br>So that occurred, and after it did, I felt like I wasn't myself anymore. I felt like I had lost everything that I am, and I immediately responded in fear. In seconds, I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this. I am not doing this. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I don't remember who I am. I don't know. I have no power. I am not doing this."  <br><br><br>So I immediately mustered my might, summoned my strength, and fought my way out again. I pushed my way back out past the veil, and I was successful in doing that. But I had inadvertently killed the fetus and killed the body that was to be mine. I had a life review for my very short life. I don't know how long I was there; it wasn't very long. However long it was, I had a life review, and I saw the grief of the poor mother and how I had made her journey more difficult by heaping this grief upon her. I was aware of over 100 people who were going to have more difficult physical experiences because of my fear right at the beginning.  <br>I was like, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe I did that." From that side, you know that all's well. It's okay. It's just a play. Everything is fine. No one is harmed. Everything's okay. But also, objectively, I was like, "Oh man, I gotta do something about this. I really have a lot of fear."  <br>So I determined to meet that and to do my best so that I could try again. I still had the same goal. I wanted to have an experience, but I knew that I didn't want to repeat that mistake and that wasted opportunity. So I spent some time in a room that can only be described as a veil acceptance simulator. It was like a place where I went, and it was like I got to practice surrendering my control to a veil that came over my consciousness. It was metaphorically like diving into a dark pool. They would plummet me under the water, and now I'm underwater, and I could cry "uncle" if I wanted, and they'd let me out because it's just a simulator. It's not the real thing.  <br>So it's a way to test yourself and to get accustomed to the surrender that is required to the veil. I did that for a while, and eventually, they brought me this life that I'm in now. I remember reviewing this life with incredible detail, like millions and millions of paths of how this life would go or could go. It's not "would" in a certain sense; it was all probabilities. But some things were extremely probable to happen, and other things were much less probable. It was like if you took a tree and laid the whole tree on its side and started at the trunk, where it's thick at the start, and then you work your way out to the branches, and it kind of gets thinner as you go.  <br>It was like that, except I could feel what it would be like to be me. There were events in this tree, but it was not primarily about events. It was primarily about what it would actually be to be this person experiencing this perspective, like to be Christian, the human, at these various stages in my life and how it might unfold.  <br>I knew that it was extremely likely that I would suffer a trauma in my early 20s and that this trauma would crush me. It would give me a chance to re-experience this very low-vibration fear, and that did happen. My body is 41 now, but when I was 22, I had a very traumatic experience. From that point of view, I was extremely excited actually at the opportunity to have this experience. It wasn't about fear or trepidation. It was like, "Wow, oh my gosh, okay, that's exciting. I'm gonna do that." I was super excited to have the chance to meet that again and have the opportunity to integrate that level of vibration.  <br>I also reviewed other aspects of the life. I reviewed who my parents were, and I knew, for instance, that my father would instill confidence in me and that that would be important to me having a rock to stand on so that I would have a solid ground to meet the fear when it came. I knew that my parents were both very loving, unconditionally loving, and that would be very helpful and nurturing to me so that I would be strong.  <br>I asked certain questions, like, "Can I be intelligent again this time?" because I knew that I had been intelligent in previous experiences, and that was a trait that I preferred. They said, "Yes, you can do that." I also asked if it was okay if I had a small amount of memory this time, just a small amount. I said, "I don't want to forget everything. I just want to have a tiny little glimmer." They said, "You can do that, but it will make the life even more difficult." I knew why, and it was because the contrast would be even greater. The contrast of experiencing this depth of density here on Earth would be even more pronounced if I had some awareness, by contrast, of where I came from.  <br>But I knew that even that contrast, like all contrast, was an opportunity for growth. So I accepted. I said, "That's okay. I accept that."  <br>Okay, so then I remember there having to be a moment to say yes and to agree to it, but I don't remember that moment. I do remember just after that being in this area that I can describe as like a waiting area where there was light, and it was beautiful. I was waiting, and then suddenly, my guide came to me and said, "Go now, like right now," almost like shaking my attention, like a rude interjection or something, like, "You've got to get on Earth time right now."  <br>And then I was with these beings that I can only describe as technicians or tinkerers. They were very mechanical in nature, and they did this thing for me where they took the veil and the body and the life and the circumstances and matched them to me. Because the soul has certain qualities to it—it's very rich and complex and personal and unique—they do this thing where they match the veil to you so that it's right, it fits right, and it's organic to you, and it'll work.  <br>I remember them doing this activity and then standing in this place that looked like a huge pit. It was like a huge shaft in this technician's room. I remember them asking me one last time, "Are you sure? Are you sure you want to do this? Because if you say yes here, you're in for the ride. There's no getting off the roller coaster. You can't get off until the ride comes to a complete stop."  <br>So I said yes, and I remember once again the incredible depth and plummet in my being, this huge drop in vibration, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, and this separation coming over me and this forgetting of all that I am. It was like diving into a vacuum of space where there's just no heat, no air, no nothing, just dense, dark, separate, and alone.  <br><br><br>I remember diving all the way down, and this time, I just focused on not fighting it. I thought, "Just don't fight it. Let the veil do what it will do. That's all I have to do is just let go. Let the veil take hold of me. That's all I have to do." So I did that, and then I was in the womb. I was there, and I had made it. I sent one message back through to the technicians: "Did it take? Did that take?" And I got one message back: "Yes."  <br>I knew that I had made it, which was very exciting. I was happy that I had made it. I had done it. I made it to the physical. I was there for a little while, and then, after a little while, that same fear rose up mightily in me. I did not like the state of me, and I said, "You know what? I am not doing this. I am not doing this. This is too dark. This is too low vibration. I am not going to tolerate a whole life of this. I'm not doing it."  <br>So once again, I began to summon my might to fight my way out. I had this most holy moment happen in my whole life at this time. The only way I can describe it is the great spirit of God, the great God, the word "source," the I AM presence of all that is, came to me. It showed me that I was still the universe and I was still the stars. I felt the churning bliss of the sun in my being, and I felt that I was not just this small thing that had forgotten everything that it was. I was so much more.  <br>I felt this incredible love for me, and God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." That was the most holy moment for me in my life because that's what we really are. We're not just these human characters. We are powerful, free, loving spirit.  <br>In that moment, I knew it. I felt it deeply in all of that I AM, and I knew the universe was in me. I wasn't stuck in this body. It called me, and I felt this, and I was like, "Oh man, oh, that's still what I am. Okay." Because that was my main fear, like I lost what I am. But in this moment, I knew that I had not lost what I was. I was still that, and it was so deeply calming. So I let go into the simple existence of being in the womb.  <br>I was there for a while, and then the next memory I have is the day I was born. I remember the shock of being born, like having a very physical experience of cold and touching and light and sound and stimulus, but having no understanding at all of what was happening. I didn't know what was going on. Just something very shocking was happening.  <br>I remember looking around at these beings in the room who were taking care of me and feeling love for them, like the nurses, and not knowing who they were. I was just like, "Wow, there are beings taking care of me. Like, where am I? What is this place?" But I had no understanding at all. It was just a very shocking event that was happening.  <br><br><br>I have only one visual image memory of the room after they had pulled me out. I remember where the bed was, where the window was, where the heating grate was, where the doctor was standing. Later in my life, I drew it from my mother. I told her I remember this room, and she said that I was correct.  <br>So that's the last memory I had for a while. I have a few very weak memories of being in a crib and being in diapers, but then, as I got older, I remember when I was learning how to walk, for instance, I remember having these memories come up to me, and I used to cheat a little bit and look back at the flowchart memory that I described. I would kind of anticipate what was going to happen, like, "Who's going to come over tomorrow?" or "Is this thing going to happen this week?" Just simple, very simple routine things that, as a kid, were important to me. I was checking in, like, "When is that going to happen? When is that going to happen?"  <br>That ability diminished significantly as I aged, so I couldn't do that anymore. I wasn't allowed to cheat anymore. But I had certain assumptions that I carried with me because of those memories, assumptions that I believed would be true in this reality that I felt were true in the other reality. So I assumed they must be true here, like, for instance, I assumed that we would be able to feel each other's emotions here because, in other reality systems, that's very normal—to be able to share our feelings and share our thoughts and just have a sharing of being. There's no need for just language; you can feel what the other being is feeling.  <br>I shared this in another video a few other times, but I remember one day my neighbor, my parents had a neighbor friend over to the house, and I remember being in a diaper and standing at this couch, listening to a funky song on the record player and dancing to it and telling the neighbor friend, "Watch me dance," and then shaking my little tush and feeling funky. I remember expecting she would be able to feel what I was feeling, but she just walked away unimpressed.  <br>When she did, it dawned on me: "She can't feel what I'm feeling." And then, when I realized that, I was like, "Where the heck am I? What place is this that we can't feel each other's emotions? What is going on? This is very alien."  <br>I also assumed that beings who were in positions of authority or power would be loving and wise because that's how it is in other reality systems. So I assumed if you were a teacher at a school or a political leader or something, like a mayor of a city, they must be really loving and wise. And if you're the president of the United States, you must be the most loving and wise person in the world. Well, that's not how it works on Earth.  <br>So that's about a summary. It's very difficult to put these things into language. When these memories began to return to me after I began meditating, I had no expectation at all. After a few months of meditation, I just began to remember, and it was like, "How did I ever forget?" There was no "aha" moment. It was like they were always there. I just had been veiled from them because of my deep association into the physical story, the physical life. It was like the most natural thing in the world to remember, but I forgot.  <br>Do you suppose that period between your being a child and what was it, 11 years, that you didn't have the memories, was that a gift from the other side to give you the painful experience you needed to mature on Earth?  <br><br><br>Yeah, so I didn't know any of this from the age of five or six until the age of 30. The primary trauma that I experienced was at the age of 22, and I certainly did not know it then. Indeed, that trauma would not have been possible if I had known this. Once I had that traumatic experience, I actually had post-traumatic stress disorder for about seven or eight years. I went through years of counseling, and I met layer after layer of this fear that I described.  <br>It was only after I had met and processed and healed a great deal of it and taken up meditation and began to open up in many other ways that this memory could return. I could not have had the experience if I had remembered.  <br>Having had these memories now for some time and dealing with the difference between sequential time on Earth and the language that we use, and your visions of everything happening on the other side more or less in the now, have you gotten any better at translating the one to something we can understand?  <br>I've really tried to translate the best I can, but I feel that any time any word is spoken, it is just wrong. There's just no way. So I can't say I've gotten better at it. Maybe I've had more practice at trying, but I can't say that language can effectively communicate it. I'm very clear about that in the book that I wrote because I think that's really important to know. It can't be depicted.  <br>So I have to probably say no, just because of the limitations of what we're dealing with. Language is ridiculously inefficient. I have to throw symbols, words at the listener, and then they have to take the symbols and compare them to their own experience, which isn't mine, and then try to understand it from within the Earth context. It's just super difficult to get anywhere with that type of communication.  <br>The fact that pain can mature us and advance us in our spiritual strength—is a life dedicated purely to comfort a wasted life?  <br><br><br>No, no, no. All experience is precious and very valuable. Any physical experience, any experience at all, but especially any physical experience, is just so precious. It's such a precious opportunity. That's something that I really think is important for people to know: having the opportunity to be the human person, no matter the circumstance, no matter if they're living a life of joy and comfort or not, is a precious, precious opportunity.  <br>We, as souls, are integrators of experience. We love having experience and then integrating it into what we are and really expressing and shining our true loving natures through that experience. So that's wonderful if it can be an experience of peace and comfort.  <br>When we talked yesterday, we talked a little about how, when the creation of our universe took place, the souls were very excited and happy about it. Describe that for the listeners.  <br><br><br>Yeah, so I remember when there was this great intent being issued down from Source, but we were all involved. It was a collective intention to take this to the next level. We were in a period of deep rest, and there was this great excitement that we would then have a new outbreath—that's the best way to put it—this new incredibly big expansion of form in the form of a universe, this universe.  <br>It was an incredibly exciting idea and opportunity that we would actually get to experience being these creatures, whatever we were going to be—not just human. Human is just one very small, precious, but very small part of the universe. The opportunity to actually have this experience from this vantage point is so additive. It's just such a precious gift to actually experience being the physical being and to have the cognitive perspective of the physical being and to have that be a part of what one is. Oh, it's the most exciting, wonderful opportunity, even though when we're here, of course, it can be very, very difficult at times. I'm not making light of that.  <br>But yet, there are souls, I take it, that have not and probably will not experience being human.  <br>Yes, the human incarnation thing is definitely not for everyone. It is only for those who wish to engage in such a deep experience of separation, to take it super far away. Duality is not fundamental, so this metaphor has limits, but if you imagine Source is like where we start, and if we can go this far away or maybe even this far away vibrationally, experientially, or maybe even this far away experientially, maybe even further, and we can meet that experience and integrate that experience and bring love through that experience, then there's this incredible expansion of being that takes place when we can do that.  <br>It is so powerful, so good, so full of love and joy. But do all beings choose to enter this level of separation? No. Being human is quite extreme. It's a very, you could even say, alien experience. I like to say that being physical is kind of like an alien state. It feels very normal and natural while we're here, more veiled, and that's all we remember, of course. But our true nature, in comparison to what we really are, this experience of feeling this separate and not knowing all of what we are, is not standard. It's very unique, very alien.  <br>It's like wearing a spacesuit or something and going into a hostile environment and seeing what you can do there. That kind of thing. So not everybody chooses to put on a spacesuit and go out into space.  <br>Well, I would think, for me, this raises the question of evil because the furthest separation we could place away from the Source would be if we turned to something that was wrong or evil or separate to a great extent because we're not exhibiting any love at all.  <br><br><br>Yeah, so I feel that what happens is, if we can go really far away, now what I'm talking about when this distance is actually not fundamentally charged yet, it's actually just very constraining. It's neutral. The experience of Earth is actually a neutral experience that we get to place our interpretation on. That's a very, very important point.  <br>But I'm just pointing out that it is very extreme. It's neutral but very extreme. But then, once we're here, there is a very important thing to recognize that happens, and that is that we react in fear. Just like I did when I first got here, I mean, I was here, and as soon as I was here, I was fearful, deeply fearful within seconds. I wasn't even born yet. It was just the state of not knowing who I was and feeling that I lost all that I am immediately provoked a very deep fear in me.  <br>Because we're so separate-feeling right now and because the constraints of being biological and physical are so extreme, there can be a huge amount of fear that could potentially arise. Now, fear, I like to call fear just unevolvingness. It just means that we have not yet evolved into such a way that we can meet this level of constraint with love all the way. If we fully integrate this and fully know it and fully process it and fully express love and all of its virtues through this, it will not provoke fear.  <br>Now, it's like the ascended masters or whatever words you want to use—they're able to meet reality with full love, full humility, full surrender. They are evolved enough that it does not provoke fear. But for the vast majority of us, it provokes fear because we have not yet come to terms with, we have not yet fully evolved through and integrated this follow-up experience.  <br>And when fear happens, that gives rise to the ego because the ego is just the portion of us that is really trying to fix the problem. There's a big problem now. The big problem is we feel separate. We feel alone. I don't feel connected to Source. I don't feel connected to God. I don't feel love anymore. I don't feel power. I don't like this. We're going to fix this problem right now.  <br>And fear immediately is like, "Ah, we want to fix it." So ego comes to the rescue and says, "Okay, you have value because you do this or you believe this, and you look, you have power because look, you can even hurt the person next to you," or whatever story the ego is telling. And there are many of them. We live over a lifetime, and the ego can have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of layers of justification and story and belief, all to try to get us to avoid the fear at the bottom and to try to help us feel better, try to fix the big problem.  <br>So that is, you know, when we say evil, evil is not a fundamental substance or force. The fundamental substance is love. It's consciousness itself, which is of love. Spirit itself, which is love, unconditional love and freedom and the joy of being, is the substrate upon which all experience occurs always. There's nothing. The deepest, deepest level is total freedom, love, joy, and power and beingness. Beingness is just so rich.  <br>But then, within a system like this of manifest experience where we experience limitations, and the ego can arise mightily, then when we act in service of the ego, which is in service of fear, we end up hurting each other a lot. And we can say that is what really evil is. Evil is all of us serving fear, making choices in service of fear.  <br>It's all about the quality of our intention. I really like the work of the physicist and consciousness explorer Tom Campbell because he talks a lot about the term "quality of intent." That is what intent are we bringing to bear in any context, any choice? And the intent is either of love or fear. That means the intent that we're issuing forth is either in alignment with the truth of who we really are—compassionate, kind, loving, accepting, selfless, giving, all the things that love can mean—or are we trying to serve the ego? Are we trying to make ourselves feel better? Are we afraid of something, so we're going to do our best to do whatever we can to avoid that fear?  <br>That fear-based intent really is what we call evil, and it can get really ugly. I'm not making it sound light. The ego can get incredibly ferocious in the local sense. Does it have any real power? No. Does fear have any real power? Not past the boundaries of this simulation, the boundaries of the play within the play.  <br>We're all afraid. We've got a planet with billions of people who are operating largely—not always, but largely—from fear-based intent every day. We're all making choices, just trying to survive, just trying to secure the next whatever, just trying to feel better now because my group is better than that group, my religious belief is better than yours, or whatever thing that we're doing. So much of that hurts. It actually hurts ourselves too and others, and that can get rather nasty and rather destructive in the short-term, local sense.  <br>It's too bad that we aren't born with a more permeable veil so that we're not feeling so alone. Babies are helpless anyway, physically helpless. They're so totally dependent on their parents or the caretakers, but oftentimes, caretakers are hurt human beings themselves, and so you're not necessarily going to find love and comfort in your mother and your father.  <br>Absolutely, that is very true. Do we know from the start that our parents are going to be either loving or not loving?  <br>Well, in the pre-life situation, you can view who they are and what's likely or not to happen. So, basically, yes, we know who they are and what's likely to happen with them. Now, do unanticipated things happen, and they might change course? Yes. This is a novel system. We're all making free will choices every day, so sometimes there can be unanticipated outcomes. That's part of what makes this physical experience so amazing is that novelty can occur.  <br><br><br>But in general, yes, we can see that ahead of time. But to your comment about it's too bad the veil is not thinner, the purpose of this reality is to come to this point of perspective and to operate lovingly through it. That is the very purpose. So it's not too bad because if we wanted to have an unveiled experience, we can and we do. That's fine. That's wonderful.  <br>But if we want to try to meet this level of contrast and constraint, and we really want to do it for real—like we're really here, we're really doing it, we're really here right now—if you really want to do that, then we need to dive all the way in and work from within the limitation.  <br>Ultimately, there is no real harm. I'm not making light of the deep suffering that can occur on Earth. Of course, I've suffered deeply myself. I'm not making light of it. I'm just saying that the love and the total freedom of our being, the immortality, is deeper. It's greater, and it cannot actually ultimately be harmed. So it's just that we are very bold and ambitious. We're so creative. You could say that we will come even this far into this veiling to have this type of experience within form.  <br>Well, look for a moment at the nature of soul. What soul is, where does it come from, assuming it's created? What's the soul's relationship to the beings that people call angels?  <br>Yeah, okay, so while we're on Earth, one of our favorite questions is, "What thing is this other thing?" because we live in a world of things, and we perceive a world of objects and distinction. So when we want to understand what this other thing is, we say, "Tell me what other things I can associate with it so that I understand it because I know what a dog looks like, and I know what spinach tastes like. I know all these things, so which one is that like?"  <br>Well, the problem is—not the problem, just it's not a problem—the way the reason that's an issue is because all that form, all those discrete things that are this and not that, they arise within the substance that transcends them all. And that substance itself is what we very crudely call spirit or consciousness itself, awareness itself.  <br>Okay, so when you ask what is the soul, the soul is that nameless, limitless substance. But if we want to use a metaphor because metaphors are pretty much probably the best way we can try to speak to some of these things, if you imagine all that is as the ocean of being, and within it are these things rising, like currents in the ocean, and there are temperatures in the water, and there are things, and the water moves, and it has properties to it, but it's all water. It's all made of water.  <br>Then the soul is like a drop in the ocean that has been given free will within whatever context it will engage. So the soul—I'm a huge fan of the Rumi quote: "You are not just the drop in the ocean. You are the mighty ocean in the drop." I love that because the soul is not the whole, but it also is the whole. It also experientially works towards evolving towards the power and the perfection of the entire whole, even one drop.  <br><br><br>So when you're asking what is the substance of the soul, that's the best way I think metaphorically to describe it. Your soul is you. The you that feels like you to you, that's your soul. You're not some higher self. Sometimes when we think about the human character and there's a higher self, well, I don't know who that higher self is, but I'm pissed off with them because I don't like being this human character here, and whoever that is, I'm gonna have a word with them later. It's you. Sorry, it's not somebody else. It's you. It's just the you that is not constrained, not veiled, not limited to just being the human character, but it's still you.  <br>So the soul is you, and you are part of the whole, and you can't be any other way, even if you do get deeply veiled for a while.  <br>We talked yesterday about miscarriages. I think I asked whether you thought other miscarriages came about because of the soul being afraid and giving up on the project it had undertaken.  <br><br><br>Well, I don't know how often or how common that is. I just know that because I made that happen, it's possible. So I imagine that there are other beings who have a similar reaction that I did. I don't know how many of them are now. I will say that in that case, clearly, it was not the mother's fault. It was mine, and I'm still responsible for it now. Like, I may be playing this character Christian for a while, but still, me, I still made that fearful choice in the womb, so I'm still responsible for that now. It was my issue, not the mother's.  <br>But if, as some NDErs have said, women who've come back from a near-death experience saying, "While I was there, I met the toddler or the young person who was my miscarriage or was my abortion, and they are growing up in heaven," now, that growing up in heaven is still for your miscarriage. Is that still part of you? Is your soul connected in some way to that forever?  <br>Yes, absolutely. The relationships that we make on Earth are very precious and lasting and important. So even the relationship of a child that has not been born yet with his mother is very powerful. Even if the mother hasn't seen the physical face of the child, there's still that relationship there.  <br>So death can't separate us. That's not a thing. It looks like, of course, it looks like that separates us on the surface here, but what love joins, relationships as they're joined by love, they can't be lost. And in other reality systems that are thought-responsive and that endure, yes, of course, we can engage one another in a way.  <br>So we're very joyful beings. To be a child, even one who was never born, to be able to kind of project forward into what the human life would be like and what I would look like and then meet in a non-physical reality system in a very physical way, that is wonderful. That's a wonderful, creative, joyful, expressive thing. Why not do that?  <br>You mentioned that you still felt responsible for the miscarriage. How does that relate to karma over lifetimes?  <br><br><br>Yes, so karma, I think, is a term that we sometimes use a bit crudely. So I just want to say this: Karma is there's an energetic accountability for who we have been and who we are. There's always cause and effect. There's cause and effect in the physical, and there's cause and effect energetically. Every single intent that we wield, the real why behind our choices, is a part of us. All of it.  <br>So I'll just make a side comment, something else we talked about yesterday that I think is important to mention in this context. Some people ask the question, "Well, if there's energetic accountability and if there's karma, well, how does that jive with unconditional love? Which one is it? Are we unconditionally accepted and loved, or is there karma?"  <br>Well, I feel very strongly that it's both. It's actually both, and that sounds contradictory, but it's not. The very base, the very root of all things, is unconditional love. We are always, always, always, always, always accepted. We are always loved and accepted, no matter what—bold and underlined—no matter what. You can do anything, and you will not be not accepted. You will be deeply loved and cherished, no matter what.  <br>Simultaneously, the wisdom and love of Source is also such that within manifest experience, we are 100% accountable for all that we have been and all that we are. And we can call that karma. It just means that there's an energetic pattern that we carry with us, and those patterns can lead us sometimes into future experiences that may be what we would call very painful—sometimes within an existing physical life, sometimes a different physical life, sometimes in a non-physical environment that we might say is experienced as very hellish.  <br>If we have a lot of fear, fear is hellish. Being afraid and then losing our power to fear and being hurtful to others is a personal hell. So if that is a part of us, we may, because of the laws of karma or whatever we want to call it, experience that in other systems that are thought-responsive, and it can seem quite hellish. Is that a punishment? No. It's not a system of "you're going to be punished now." It's a system of very natural and almost logical cause and effect energetically so that we can learn and grow through and integrate even that depth of fear because, when we can do that, that adds to the love and joy.  <br>It's ultimately all in service of love and joy. Love is the real driver behind it all, even karma experiences, even temporary experiences that might be extremely painful. The soul is so great that it will even go through experiences of great pain in its path towards growth.  <br>I'm going to jump back into metaphor for a minute. If we pre-existed the creation, I had said earlier we're part of the creation, but if we pre-existed the creation, does that mean we are the ocean? Is God, and we are drops, which are essentially God? And if so, and we are capable of doing bad things, does that mean that God is capable of doing bad things as well?  <br>Okay, so we are drops in the ocean, and we are a part of God. Your first part of the question, yes. There's a great Wayne Dyer quote I love, and I can't remember it word for word, but something to the effect of, "And you are part of God, and you are God, and that is not a statement of blasphemy. It is a statement of your identity," and something in the quote about how you can know this humbly too, even as you know it. That is who we really are.  <br>Okay, so does that mean that we created evil? No, because okay, so it's not that God created evil. It's that Source is so unconditionally loving that it gives us the opportunity to experience not love for the purposes of the expansion of love and joy, which is enduring. So it's so loving that it gives us the chance to even engage an experience where fearful choices can happen, where we can issue fearful choices.  <br>Our fear is that evil. Fear is—I don't like just drawing direct correlations because it's not that simple—but you could say that fearful intention is the evil. So now, are you evil? No. Your true nature is love and joy, but when you engage in a system of limitation like this voluntarily and you subject yourself to having to make choices in this duality, it is possible that fearful choices can happen, and that's how it arises.  <br>So it's almost kind of like a natural artifact for a free will system in which fear is possible. Does that mean that evil was created as a thing? No. It's that we are so free and so creative and so loving that we are enabled, we are able to engage systems where fearful choices can happen.  <br>Do you think duality is necessary for a physical existence?  <br>No, so well, if you're okay, so in order to have a physical existence, it is going to need to be a reality of some kind of form. So if by any form, if that's how you're defining duality, then yes, because in order to have a body, that means you have a definition. So if you have a definition, then you're in a reality of definition.  <br>And there are many realities of definition that are not Earth, even like simple astral realms above ours that are very, very Earth-like. They are experienced as super normal, so normally you can't even tell the difference. They're not physical as how we would perceive them, but when you're there, it's ridiculously physical. When you have a body, there are other systems where you can have a body, and those systems have form.  <br>But all of that is, but form is a tool and a toy of creation of spirit. So we don't have to use it. We can exist beyond it already. So if you're talking about duality in the earthly sense, like this level of extreme with linear time and discrete location, you don't need to be in a reality system of linear time and discrete location to have a body.  <br>I gather some of your background is in technology, and you describe the veil acceptance simulator sort of like a machine with technicians who are fine-tuning it for each individual soul. Would a reverse machine be constructable on Earth so that we could run the veil?  <br>No, no. Okay, so first of all, the technicians I mentioned are for the real veil acceptance simulator. The simulator did not have those same beings. I don't know how it was being run, but it was not the same beings.  <br>Okay, can we do it from here? Here's a good metaphor: If you sit down at your computer and you play a video game like World of Warcraft, and you're in a massive multiplayer online role-playing game, and you sit down, and now you're an elf—that's Tom Campbell's favorite metaphor—so now you're an elf in the video game. Now, you've been in the video game so long, and part of this game is you forget that you're playing a game.  <br>And then one day, you're having a video conversation with someone, and they say, "Do you think we can build a reverse simulator inside the game to take us back out of the game?" No, because you're already outside the game right now. You don't need anything in the game. The in-game is the illusion. So the physical is like the dream. You don't need technology in the dream to step back to where you already are, which is the place that precedes the dream.  <br>That's why the veil is like—I like calling it a consciousness technology because that's how it feels. It's like a technology that we can engage and wear for the purposes of expansion of the body of our living awareness through an experience like this, for an experience that's physical where we can make choices and integrate experience. That is only possible because we have this ability to veil ourselves and to be limited to just that perspective from that higher-up system.  <br><br><br>I think Paul said that we are already seated in the heavenlies, which almost suggests that we are out there, and the bodies that we're running and think are us are just avatars in a game, in a video game we call Earth life.  <br>Yes, I think it's very much like that, actually. Metaphorically, it's like we fall asleep in heaven and have the dream of Earth. And then, while you're on Earth, it's like kind of a fractal system. By the way, while you're on Earth, you might play a video game and then lose yourself for a while in the game. You're not thinking about anything else. You can't even see the room around you because you're so focused on the game. Kind of like that, but much bigger of a step, of course, between us and the next level up where we are. We are already there right now.  <br>One other point I'll make about the veil in the context of this question: It's not that the veil is absolute. It's organic. What happens is, the more we associate with the story of our lives and the thoughts—it's all the thoughts—we keep so deeply associated with this mind chatter and with all the things: "I got to do this, and who I am, and this is my name, and I got a job, and this person pissed me off," and we got all these thoughts that are coming up and rising up, and we're so associated with them, we're gripping onto them.  <br>That act of associating with the form of this local character is what deepens the veil. So like children, they're veiled, but their veil is much more permeable because they have not yet deeply associated with the story of their human life. They can come and go pretty easily because they're just having a good time. They're having an experience.  <br>But then, as they get older and they really start taking it seriously, and they're developing, and now, "This is my name, and I gotta go to school, and my parents told me a hundred times I gotta take out the trash," and as those things happen, then that becomes deeper and deeper who we are. And the veil works like that.  <br><br><br>So I'm mentioning that in the context of your question because if we let go of all of our needs, associations, all the thinking, and we just, with great alertness and fidelity, are with the present moment, then the larger parts of us can rise back up on their own because we're already on the other side. The veil is not absolute. It's organic. So if we let go all the way, then it is possible to have experiences that are higher in nature.  <br>I think you've said that we are here to actualize love. If we did that, that might thin the veil as well.  <br>Absolutely. Oh, that's a really good point. Thank you for saying it that way too because that's another important point. Fear is a vibrational distance. So if we're super deep in fear and we're buying into perceptions of fear, that takes us vibrationally very far away. It makes the canyon wider immediately.  <br>So like if you believe, "I'm powerless," or "I'm unworthy of love," as soon as you really buy into that, you're vibrationally really far. But love is our true nature. So yes, when we can actualize love and when we can be in a state where we know love, and even just appreciation for a simple thing—just looking at a sunset and being like, "Oh, wow, that's beautiful. I love that"—even just that moment, the veil's thinner because what's happened is you're in a state of love that is more vibrationally in alignment with what you really are.  <br>And when you do that, it's a lot easier, by the way, to interact with the other side too because your vibration's higher, and they're able to engage easier with you. Whereas if you're lost in fear all the time, your vibration is relatively quite low, and that can be obfuscating itself.  <br>Christian, sadly, we are just about out of time for today, but tell the listeners how they can find out more about you and your book and your mission.  <br>Yeah, so first of all, I want to say that my book is free for anybody who wants to read it. Please go to my website at walkinthephysical.com. Go to the book tab, book page, third link down is a link to the Google Books entry. You can just click the "read for free" button, and it's all there for free.  <br>My website is walkinthephysical.com, and I have some talks and other things shared there. You can reach me at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:walkinthephysical@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:walkinthephysical@gmail.com" target="_blank">walkinthephysical@gmail.com</a> if you'd like to email me. The book is my attempt to somehow bring some language to this in a way that's concise. I feel I was guided by spirit in a certain way to do this in a certain way, and to be honest, I feel that the book is my life's work, and I'm deeply happy that it's now here. Hopefully, it will help at least a few people.  <br>But I just want to say before we close that what's most important that I can say to you today is, whoever you are listening, you are loved. You are so loved. You don't need me or anybody else. You don't need any external thing. You are a part of God right now, and you are not actually human. You're having the experience of being human, and even though you may not feel it today, you are so deeply loved.  <br>And ultimately, please also be reminded, there's nothing to fear. This whole experience of contrast and duality, I know we take it really seriously while we're here, but ultimately, there is no reason to fear it. It's all good.  <br>And what's good is you're reminding us of that as well, Christian.

 <br>INTUITIVE PSYCHIC READING: Chatting With Christian Sundberg<br>
youtube.com/watch?v=5sZj24buFi8  <br>11 AUG 2021<br><br><br>Hi, intuitive viewers! Welcome, welcome! I am very excited today. I’ve got a really interesting, intriguing, amazing guest. This is Christian Sundberg. Hi, Christian!  <br>Christian: Hi.  <br>Host: Christian is the author of a new book called A Walk in the Physical. His story is, I guess, not unique because it’s a story we’ve all kind of experienced, but what is unique is that he has memory of it. He has memory of the pre-existence, of planning his life, coming to Earth, using his free will to determine his planning for Earth. He’s going to share his story and all of the memories he has of this amazing pre-existence. So, Christian, please go ahead and share your story with us.  <br>Christian: Thank you so much. I’m honored to be here. Okay, so before I start, I just have to say that everything I’m going to attempt to say is really beyond language. There’s no way I can actually speak to this topic because words are form. They’re symbols from our local world. When we’re human, we assume that things of our world are all that there is, so we try to understand from the human vantage point. But our higher state, who we really are, the higher realms, and our true nature vastly transcend those symbols and the content of the Earth experience. <br>So, I’m going to try to use some words, but I just have to make that disclaimer because it’s not possible for anyone to simply say, “It’s like this.” It’s just not how it is. We’re in a state of being right now that is highly constrained and in a very specific point of perspective, and who we truly are vastly transcends that perspective. So, I just want to say that first.  <br>Host: Perfect. Okay, so…  <br>Christian: Okay, so this is hard to talk about because these memories do have a sequence, but they also all feel like they’re happening all at once, like right now. So, I’m going to speak about them in sequence, but it gets a little bit difficult to do that. Our local linear time is artificial. Higher time is more difficult to speak to from here.  <br><br><br>Okay, so long ago, before I had ever had any physical incarnations at all, I remember coming across a being who had been physical. This being was so beautiful. I remember coming across him and being deeply moved by what I felt of him, about his nature, about who he really was. I asked him—and again, this isn’t words; this is telepathic communication on that side—I said something to the effect of, “My goodness, look at you! What have you done? How are you this? How are you feeling? Are you feeling everything that I feel that you’re feeling?” And he shared that he was.  <br>It was so full of love, power, joy, expansiveness, and capacity. It was just beautiful. So, I asked him what he had done, and he shared with me that he had been physical. He shared, very immediately, this physical experience he had had where he had suffered a physical ailment of some kind—some kind of pain or sickness. <br>I don’t know specifically what it was, but I remember reviewing his pain that he had gone through for years and how it just crushed him and pushed him so far in a certain direction. But he had chosen to meet that experience with openness and acceptance. He had integrated it, processed it, and brought love to that experience. In so doing, he had expanded in such a beautiful, incredible way.  <br>I asked him, “Were you healed?” because I saw how much he had been damaged—physically damaged and emotionally damaged. He said yes, and he shared with me this depth of healing. I could feel how deep he had been healed. I said, “Well, I want to do that. I’m going to do that.” I was just so inspired.  <br>He said, “Okay, well then, go talk to your guides.” He also kind of communicated, at first, like, “Yeah, that’s what they all say.” I said, “No, I’m serious.” I remember him communicating, “It’s difficult in a way you’ve never known. It’s very difficult in a new way.” At the time, I was ignorant to how difficult it might be.  <br><br><br>So, okay, then I lived many lives, and I found him again later. I shared with him some of what I had done, and I said something to the effect of, “See, I’m partway through this journey.” He was encouraging.  <br>Okay, so then I’m going to jump a bit. The majority of this pre-life memory is of a time that is somewhat immediately preceding this life right now. I had taken a long break. I remember being in a state where it was like being on a long weekend and being reluctant to give it up. I remember frolicking, sailing, and flying through this realm of gold, reveling in the bliss of being and in the deep peace and relaxation of that. I was doing certain activities that I’m not going to try to put words on from here because I think that automatically does them a disservice. They’re higher in nature—creative activities and activities of communication with others.  <br>I remember this guy coming to me over and over and saying, “Are you ready to go back yet?” And I just kept putting him off, like, “No, I’m not ready yet.” But he kept reminding me of my own intention, like, “Are you ready now? See, you’re doing this. Are you ready to go back?” Finally, I said, “Okay, I’m ready. I’m ready to go back. I’m ready for that deep challenge again.”  <br>I remember reviewing with him what I can only describe as my state—who I was, who I’d been. It’s really hard to describe this, but it’s kind of like… imagine this is a really poor metaphor… imagine if you looked at a chart with a graph, like a bar graph or something. This is super crude, but I reviewed through it all these qualities that I had experienced or that I had been, and I understood it was about knowing them at a deep level of who I really was.  <br>There was one that was glaringly obvious, like, “Oh, I really need to do something about that.” It was like the super deep fear that had vested me in a previous experience. In this previous life, I had been overcome by this fear, and it led me down a path where I was a very damaging person. I was very hurtful to others. By the end of that life, I ended up dying in a painful, agonizing death because of the fear. The fear led me into a place where I eventually died physically in a painful way.  <br>I couldn’t believe the depth of this fear. It was such a low vibration. It was so distant from Source for me. It was almost unspeakably low vibration. I remember reviewing it and knowing, “Wow, if I can meet that and integrate that, I knew there would be an expansion of being possible—an expansion of myself and an expansion of all that is, too, because I’m a part of it. We’re all part of the whole.” So, I knew that it would be an incredible service if I could meet this experience and fully integrate it and heal through that at that depth. If I could do that, I knew the expansion would be so beautiful and incredible.  <br>Even then, I could see that it was so daunting. I remember asking, “Is it even possible? Has any being in all of creation ever engaged successfully with something this low vibration?” I was shown yes, and I was told, “You have all the time available to you to do so. You don’t have to do it all at once. All of time is given to you to do this.”  <br>I was super excited, and I said, “Okay, I’m going to do it.” It seems strange to me as a human to say that because, here, it’s super hard. But from that perspective, I remember knowing my strength. I knew what we are—the immortal, unharmable, loving, powerful nature of who we are. So, I thought, “Then I’ll do it.”  <br><br><br>They brought me a life for this purpose. I reviewed that life, and I accepted that life. I accepted the veil. So, for that life now… okay, the veil is just a word we use, but this is the part that is on the forefront of my mind almost every day because the sensation of accepting the veil is very extreme. For me, I experienced it like diving into a deep, dark pool or something, having this plummet in vibration.  <br>I like to describe it like an amplifier—a sound amplifier. It makes it pitch, and then you turn it down, and then you turn it down to the bottom, and then you keep going and turn it down more and more and more and more, and then some more, and then more still. That’s what it felt like in the body of my being—to come from that place of all connectedness and bliss and total freedom down, down, down, down, down, down, down. It’s just a breathtaking dive, like a plummet down into a place that felt comparatively like a vacuum—a place that had no heat, no air. It just felt empty and simultaneously super dense, like being shoved inside a small metal can or something like that.  <br>So, I went through this experience, and then I was in the womb for this life. But within seconds, I reacted very strongly in fear because every life I was aware of has a unique vibrational place—a vibrational destination or a point of perspective. This life had a very, very low vibrational perspective. So, within moments of being there, I was like, “I am not doing this. This is ridiculous. I am not doing this. This is so dark. I am not myself. I don’t feel like myself anymore. I’m not doing this.”  <br>So, I promptly mustered my might, my full strength, and I fought my way out. I smoked the veil. I could feel the veil, and I basically pushed out past it and threw it. I was successful in doing so, but I had killed the fetus. I killed the body that was to be mine.  <br>So, I had a life review for that super short life, and I became aware of how my fear—even though I had all these big, good intentions—right at the beginning, before I was even born, how my fear had affected the mother. I became aware that the mother was heaped in sorrow, and because of her sorrow, hundreds of other people were negatively impacted by my fear.  <br>From that side, you know that all is well. There’s actually no real problem, but I was also very disappointed in myself. I could see it very clearly, like, “Oh, man, I can’t believe I did that. I can’t believe I have that much fear.” That’s really what the recognition was—like, “I am not evolved in this way. I’ve not integrated this experience yet.”  <br>So, I spent some time in a room that can best be described as a veil acceptance simulator. It’s like a pretend veil where you can get in the pool metaphorically, and it’s like being dunked under the water. They put this mock veil over you, except in there, you can cry uncle. You can say, “I want out. This is too much.”  <br>I remember doing that and practicing that. The real thing is a lot more difficult than the simulator. It was helpful, but it wasn’t as extreme as the real deal.  <br><br><br>Okay, so I had wasted that first life opportunity, but I still wanted to do this. I still had the same intention. So, they brought me a second life—this life. I reviewed it in great detail, and I knew that this life was not as appropriate as the first one would have been. I can’t put a number on it, but I said in one previous video where I shared this experience that that life was like a 99, and this one was like an 86 or 87 percent—something like that. Making up numbers is not like that, but it was kind of like that. This life was pretty good. It wasn’t perfect, but it did offer the correct circumstance set and constraint set for my intention.  <br>I reviewed what can only be described as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold and what it would be like to be me as Christian, the human. It wasn’t primarily about events. It was primarily about what it would feel like to be me in exactly this place. It was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side, and you started at the trunk, and it went out to branches. It was kind of like that. There were high probabilities to start, and there were certain thick trunk branches that would very likely go all the way to the end. There were some side branches that were a lot less likely, but it was millions of possibilities that I reviewed all at once. It was not hard to do so. I reviewed it all within moments.  <br>I was super excited. I knew that a trauma would likely befall me in my early 20s that would crush me and allow me to have the opportunity to experience this extremely low vibration fear. I was super excited. Now, as a human, it gives the ego pause, but at the time, I was super excited to do this.  <br>I remember there having to be a moment to accept. I don’t remember that moment, but I do remember then being in a period where I was basically waiting for the very beginning. I was in this kind of holding area, this waiting room. I remember all of a sudden this guy coming to me like, “Okay, go now.” It was like a slap of, “Get going. Right now, you’ve got to get on Earth.” I could feel that in order to engage Earth correctly from that time to this time, it was like, “Now. Right now.”  <br>So, the next memory I have is being with these guys that I can only describe as technicians or tinkerers. They were these beings that are technical in nature. I don’t know how to describe them other than their very nature is very almost mechanical, but in a way with consciousness technology or something. It’s hard to explain.  <br>So, they did this thing for me where they basically prepared the veil for me because the soul has certain qualities and a certain nature, and the life and the body have certain things going on. They do this thing where they make it all fit for the veil. So, then I was with them in this area. I remember seeing what looked like a huge pit that I was about to dive in. That was like the final moment—this is it.  <br>I remember they asked me one last time, “Are you sure you want to do this?” because I knew that once I said yes here, I was in for the ride. There was no going back. This is like once you press this button, you’re strapped in for the duration of the ride. You cannot get off the roller coaster.  <br>So, I said yes, and then I remember once again the veil coming over me and this plummet in vibration—down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more, lower still, more, lower, lower, lower. This time, I was just trying not to fight it. I was just choosing to allow the experience to the best that I could, to surrender my control sufficiently.  <br>I waited there for a while, and I felt fear again. So, I sent a little ping back to the technicians, like, “Did it take?” And they came back with, “Yes.” I was feeling relieved, actually. I was like, “Okay, I’m here now. I did it. I made it.”  <br>I was there for a while, and then after a while, I said, “You know what? I’m not doing this. This is not happening. This is so dark. This is ridiculous. I’m not subjecting myself to this. No way.” So, once again, I began to muster my might to fight my way out.  <br><br><br>As I did that, the most beautiful, holy moment happened for me. This moment is the most holy moment of my whole life. I felt the Spirit of God come to me and say—that’s not language, but it was like the depth of my being was shown to me again. I felt the stars and the galaxies, and I felt all that we are. I felt the churning bliss of the sun, and I felt the rich bliss of being. I don’t know how else to say it. I knew that I was all of that.  <br>God said to me, “This is still what you are. You can never not be this.” It’s so personal to me, but it’s what we really are. We come here to be human, but we are far, far more. We have entered very, very deeply into this veiled experience. We forget who we are. We don’t have full knowledge right now. We don’t remember. We don’t have conscious access most of the time. It seems very rigorous, but we don’t have that access to the rest of what we are. But we still are that.  <br>Whenever I think of that, I’m just very deeply humbled because the vastness, the beauty, and the perfection of that Source from which we come is beyond words. To be known and seen by it is… anyway, I can’t put words on it. It’s just the stuff of what we are. It’s the stuff of life.  <br>Okay, anyway, so that calmed me. I was like, “Oh, that’s still what I am. That’s wonderful.” It relaxed me because it was like, “Oh, I don’t have to fight. Okay.” So, I let go into the simple existence of being in the womb.  <br>I was there for a while, and then my next memory is of being born. I remember the pain, the shock, the temperature, the touching, the lights, and having this very shocking experience, but not having any intellectual context for it at all. I had no knowledge. I had no understanding at all. I was just experiencing something extreme—this birth event.  <br>I have only one visual image memory of that day, and it’s actually from the room. I don’t remember where I was, but I remember the whole room—where the bed was, where the window was, where the heating vent was. I remember being intensely curious, like, “Where am I?” I remember looking at the nurses that were there and the other people in the room. I didn’t know what they were. I didn’t know anything. I just knew, “Oh, they’re taking care of me. This is beautiful. What’s happening? Why do I hurt? What is this cold?” And then someone cutting my body—a certain incision. I remember, “Oh, that’s not fun. What is that?” It was a super foreign and alien feeling.  <br><br><br>But that was it. After that, I don’t have any memory for a while. I have some really vague memories as a baby, like looking up at the dangly thing in the crib and crying for my mother. But it wasn’t until a few years later, when I was older, that I remember having this pre-birth memory at least in pieces.  <br>I remember assuming that everybody did. I remember assuming things from the other reality would be true here. For instance, I assumed that we would be able to feel each other’s emotions here because that’s very normal in higher systems. We share our feeling, our thinking, and our being. There’s no room for misunderstanding. We just share what we are, and that includes feeling.  <br>I shared this in other videos as well, but I remember being a small child who was young enough that I still had a diaper on. I had just learned how to walk. My parents had a neighbor friend over to the house, and I remember the neighbor standing there in the room. I asked her to watch me dance. There was this funky music on the music player, and I remember shaking my little tush at the couch, assuming that she would just feel as awesome and funky as I did because I’m sharing my funkiness with her, right? But she just walked away unimpressed.  <br>It dawned on me at that moment, “She can’t feel what I’m feeling.” When I realized that, I was like, “Where the heck am I? What is this place where we can’t feel each other’s emotions? What is going on? This is crazy. It’s very strange.”  <br>Another assumption I had was that beings of higher authority in our culture would be beings of greater love and wisdom because, in the other systems, there’s something of a hierarchy where beings of greater love and wisdom have positions of authority, assistance, and help—guides. They’re lovely.  <br>Well, guess what? Here is not necessarily how it works. I remember thinking, “Boy, if someone’s teaching a classroom in a school, they must be very loving and wise. If someone is the mayor of a city, they must be really loving and wise. If someone is the president of the United States, they must be the most loving, wise, caring, patient person in the world.” That’s not how it works on Earth. That’s not how it works.  <br><br><br>I feel like even to that, I still have to remind myself that certain things are just not how it works here.  <br>Okay, so that’s a summary. Again, these things are very difficult to put into words. I feel like as the memory returns… okay, so the memory returned to me at the age of 30 after I had taken up a long-term meditation practice. I began to have out-of-body experiences, and they were very eye-opening for me because when you have these experiences in the non-physical, they are not subtle. They are ridiculously more real than this, and they can be very shocking to one’s worldview and perspective.  <br>So, I began to have those experiences, and I didn’t speak about my pre-birth memory for the first seven or eight years. I was around the age of 30 when it returned. I didn’t talk about this until about the age of 38. I’m 41 now. I didn’t talk about it because I just didn’t feel like the time was right. I felt like it wouldn’t be well-received, and it just didn’t intuitively sense right. Also, of course, this is the kind of thing you don’t really talk about if you want to be perceived as a normal person. I’m a working professional adult. This is the kind of thing you don’t normally share.  <br>But a few years ago, I felt intuitively, “Okay, the ground is fertile. The time is right. It’s time to start reminding each other and sharing.” So, that’s what I’m doing.  <br>Host: Well, I feel like I’ve been through an incredible experience with you. Thank you so much for sharing that. This is my first question: Since you’ve shared your story, have you heard from other people who say, “Yeah, I remember too”?  <br><br><br>Christian: Yes, yes. I have probably heard from 40 or 50 other pre-birth experiencers. Some of their recollection is very similar to what I experienced. It’s so fun. I love connecting with pre-birth experiencers because I feel like we’ve made it. We’re here. We made it this far. Look at where we are, guys. We’re out in the wilderness. We’re in the weeds, and we’re bumping fists a little bit now.  <br>People say, “Oh, you have so much memory. I’m so veiled.” It’s so good to have that interaction with those who also have a glimmer because there’s just a resonance—a vibrational resonance—meeting those people. I even met one woman who said she was listening to one of my other videos where I discussed the veil acceptance simulator, and she remembers the same thing. She said when she heard it, she pulled off the side of the road because she couldn’t believe she had heard it.  <br>She approached me, and I love hearing that because I’ve never heard anybody else say that. I remember it, but I’ve never heard anybody else talk about that. This woman said, “It’s exactly like that—like diving into a deep, dark pool, and you can get out if you need to.” Oh my gosh, it’s so cool to be able to have that connection.  <br>So, I’ve probably met 40 or 50 other people over the last three years. It’s amazing.  <br>Host: It must be so validating too to hear that—to have a shared experience where you can actually remember. Because, to talk about it and have someone like me say, “I know what you’re saying is right. I don’t know where I know that from, but I know that’s correct.” But to have someone actually remember it with their brain, it must be so validating to hear that.  <br>Christian: Yeah, it’s interesting you say that because I suppose it is somewhat validating, but it’d be a little bit like somebody saying, “You see the sky, and somebody else tells you they see the sky too. Now you feel validated that you’ve seen the sky.” I just don’t need validation because I know what I experienced.  <br>But it is really… okay, so there is a higher, bigger picture going on here that is very consistent. I relate very much to near-death experiencers—people who have died and come back. They’re far more common to interact with than pre-birth memory people. I love near-death experiences. I feel like every time I have a conversation with a near-death experiencer, it’s like we can skip the first 20 letters of the alphabet and go straight to the end and really engage and be authentic. It’s okay. We can be whoever we are. We don’t need to be fake. If I’m feeling a certain way, I can feel it. I don’t need to put on a face.  <br>That authenticity is beautiful. So, I love that shared meeting because there really is a larger context going on here that is verifiable. Earth is experiencing a lot of belief right now. We have belief systems that are very deep. I’m not knocking belief systems. Belief systems have a very important place for many people, but there is a bigger truth that transcends earthly belief. It really is real, and it is personally investigatable.  <br>That’s why I feel meditation is extremely helpful for that because what do we investigate? Well, it’s not a whole bunch of new ideas like we’re entertaining right now while we’re listening to this video. It’s our awareness itself—our consciousness itself. Rigorously, very alert investigation—no labels, no stories. Just go look. Spend time every day without expectation, looking at your awareness itself.  <br>Over time, as you do that, the dreamlike nature of thinking will become more and more apparent. The thoughts lose their oomph. They lose their hold, and as that happens, the ego stories begin to lose their hold, which means fears might come up, and that’s okay. But as we meet everything that we actually are experiencing—everything that is actually happening—as we go closer to what is real—awareness itself—larger parts of ourselves rise up all on their own. It’s not like we have to go get them. It’s just what we are.  <br>So, I feel like that’s a really important message because I want to remind people that that’s possible and that we are more. The truth is beautiful, wonderful, and good. The truth of what we are—which is not just a religious belief or a fairy tale—I know it seems super distant from Earth sometimes because we are engaging in an extremely low vibrational experience by comparison, but the truth is so good, so freeing, so wonderful that even the taste of it is…  <br>There is nothing to fear here on Earth. There is nothing to fear, and I’ve come to face fear. I face fear. I know fear, so I don’t say it lightly because I know the deep challenge of being human. I’m not making light of that, but there is nothing to fear.  <br>That is absolutely true, and that’s not just a nice-sounding, “Oh, that sounds so nice, but my life is horrible.” No, underneath the labels and the stories of “life is horrible” or “the world is in such a state” or “I am weak” or all these stories, underneath it all, the bedrock of what we are—consciousness itself—is always, always full of love, joy, and freedom. That is a beautiful thing.  <br>I went on a long tangent there, but I feel like that’s exactly right. I hope that people take that in and really hear that for what it is because I think that is the message. We are so much more than just this. There’s so much more there, and so much more we’re connected with.  <br><br><br>Host: I want to go back to some of the elements of your story, Christian, because maybe it’s just the way I look at it, or maybe it’s also from coming from a very organized religion as a younger person, but when you first meet this being—the being that kind of inspired you to get on this journey—do you think that being was kind of like a recruiter in a way?  <br>Because I think not every spirit is maybe suited to Earth. Maybe there are other ways to learn things, but it almost feels like you came across him, and it’s like, “This is what we think you’d be good for. This is what you could do.” Do you think it was kind of like that—a recruiting kind of thing, like, “You’re the kind of spirit who could do well on Earth”?  <br>Christian: No, okay, no, not at all. No, I was not recruiting. This is long ago. I know what you’re saying, but no, he was… I was almost pestering him. Okay, I mean, it’s not truly pestering, but I’m saying that I was… he was doing something else, and I came across him. We were with other beings as well, but he stood out.  <br>I was persistent in my interest because of what I saw in the nature of who he was. What’s interesting is that I shared this in several videos, and this is another thing I hadn’t really heard anybody talk about before—being inspired by another being. But then, about a year ago, I came across a Robert Monroe video. He’s an out-of-body explorer with the Monroe Institute, and he actually said something to the effect of, “Most of us who come here were at one point inspired by a being who has been physical because we see what expansion is possible, and we say something like, ‘Even if it takes a thousand lifetimes, I’ll do that.’”  <br>Well, I relate to that. I came across this being, and I was deeply inspired to do this. Now, I do 100% agree that not all beings will choose to come to Earth. The vast, vast majority of spirit is… there are so many more spirits that are not engaged in Earth than there are on Earth. In fact, even just the guides that we have locally, I feel, outnumber the participants in the play.  <br>We have so many characters on Earth right now. Everyone listening to this video who’s physical—there may be non-physical friends listening to this—but everyone who’s physical right now is playing a part of a character here on Earth. That’s just a metaphor. You’re being yourself. You’re being a human.  <br>I feel that the number of guides and friends of ours—family and friends in the non-physical that participate in an indirect way or maybe a slightly direct way, helping us—they outnumber us. I want to point that out because, to us on Earth, it looks like, “Oh, there’s just billions of humans, and this is… dude, having one human lifetime—the chance to play a human—is the most precious, amazing, unique, just precious gift.”  <br>There are so many spirits in all of creation. There are so many beings available that to be given the opportunity to play a human is like, “Oh, out of all of creation, I’m being given the opportunity to be a human—this human. Oh my gosh, it’s the biggest honor.”  <br>So, you may not think about that. Whoever’s listening today, and of course, I understand if you don’t remember making the choice to come, but you—out of every being—you were given the chance to be you, to be this physical hue. Just… you were given a chance. It’s just the most beautiful, remarkable, precious gift.  <br>Being a human is especially unique, especially because Earth is just kind of a high-value, unique place. So, to play a human—one of the humans—oh my goodness, wow, what an opportunity.  <br>Host: When you talk about coming… the part of your story that… because I’ve heard you talk about your experience more than one time because it’s so intriguing to me, so I’ve heard you talk on other shows about this. When you talk about the place we come from and having all of this knowledge and all this love and all this connection, and when you come down to Earth and you’re losing that and losing that and losing that, it is the most… it touches my heart in a way I can’t explain.  <br>I know what you’re talking about, and it just… yeah, that part of the story always just gets to me, and I can just feel it because I know that’s the truth. Let me ask you this: How do you, when you think of that, bring whatever is missing now for that place and how that has been kind of… we’ve been removed from that to come here? How do you inject that into your life? What are things here that give you that little spark of… for me, it’s like laughter and music—those two things, joy and music. Those things I feel I can feel a connection—an instant connection—to my true self, to that place. So, what do you recognize here that we can hook into to feel that even a little bit and to remind us of where we come from?  <br><br><br>Christian: That’s a beautiful question. I really appreciate your comment, by the way, feeling that about the veil. All of us know on some level… okay, so I’ll just say to start that our true nature is love, joy, and freedom. So, when we engage in something here that is of joy, we immediately and instantaneously are in a vibrational alignment with what we really are. So, that bridges the gap.  <br>It’s hard to put this in a word because you want to think about it like… I know this sounds abstract to those of us who are used to thinking in physical terms, but if you imagine a canyon—I’ll use a physical metaphor—if you imagine that the distance between there and here is like a canyon, and it’s a vibrational canyon. So, it’s a distance in vibration.  <br>You’re not actually on this side of the canyon. What’s actually happening is you have voluntarily surrendered… okay, the veil can only function with our voluntary commitment to it. It’s not possible to be veiled against our will because the spirit is sovereign. It’s a part of Source. There’s no greater authority, so it can’t be veiled without an agreement.  <br>So, we agree to… you might want to think of the veil like a cloak that we wear, maybe, or a spacesuit that we climb into. But unlike those physical metaphors, there’s not actually a real distance. There’s only a constraint that has been placed upon consciousness itself. You are still your consciousness itself right now. That’s the key. That’s like the most important thing. I know it sounds abstract, but you are your awareness itself.  <br>So, that awareness—consciousness itself—is, if you think of that as like the substance of what really is, that’s the fundamental substrate of being, of existence. So, then that consciousness beholds form—things, sensory experience, sight, sound, touch, thoughts, ideas, perceptions, beliefs—all these things.  <br>When we entertain a perspective that is in alignment with the truth—for instance, “I am loved”—our vibration immediately matches that perception, which is much closer to the other side of the canyon. If, on the other hand, we entertain a belief like, “The world is terrible, and I have no power,” then we take a vibrational step, and the canyon actually gets wider.  <br>But the thing is, it’s not really there. What the veil has done is allowed us to entertain these many perspectives because where else can you entertain this perspective of being powerless or being stuck in pain or being unworthy or whatever else? Where else can you do that other than here?  <br>So, I say all that as a background to your question because when we… we are already love, freedom, and joy—always, always, always. We just get covered up in gunk—all the form association, all the pain of our lives, all the limitations, all the bodily limitations, the neurological limitations, the biochemical limitations. But all of that is subordinate to the spirit.  <br>So, when you, as spirit, entertain an experience that is for you beautiful and loving or fun—even just fun—your vibration immediately moves back toward what you normally are because you are now entertaining a perception that is much closer to the truth. Fearful perceptions are not ultimately true, even though so very much of the decision-making we make on Earth currently is based on fear—based on ego, which comes from fear.  <br>We are all making decisions every day to protect ourselves, to try to get ahead of the next guy, to improve our image, to try to avoid the things we’re afraid of, to avoid our pain, avoid our pain, avoid our pain—just keep avoiding our pain. We do all these things, but our true nature is always love, joy, and freedom.  <br>So, the answer is… from my man, I just say my comment to your question is: For you, whatever brings you joy, whatever you see beauty in, that brings you closer to your true spiritual nature already. But then, simultaneously, if you’re talking about something in the world, that would be my comment. But I want to say, as a more fundamental statement, you can also investigate your awareness itself through meditation—not to go get happiness, but because happiness is what you already are.  <br>So, if you spend the time personally investigating your awareness itself, the painful form associations will gradually—you need to be able to put in the time; this doesn’t happen in five minutes—gradually lose their hold on you. Beneath all that, you may find pain, but if you’re willing to face and feel all things and be completely alert, the real you is always down there, and you are already peace, joy, and love.  <br>You don’t actually need a form. You don’t actually need a thing—a person, a drug. You don’t need something. You are already that. The question is: What are you buying into that you think is so proven? Because these negative perceptions we think are proven to us time and again over the decades. “The world is obviously dark. Look, see? Look at all this terrible stuff happening in the world.”  <br>Our beliefs here become invisible to us so much that the world looks like our beliefs. If we believe something about the world, that’s the way the world looks. But underneath that, we put meaning on it. Underneath all that, we are love and joy.  <br>So, that was kind of a long comment, but…  <br>Host: No, I think that’s great. I think it kind of keeps coming back to that same message of, “This is who we really are.” All of this stuff is like you said. I think the analogy of the play works best for me because it’s like we’re all playing characters, and then we go off stage, and everybody just resumes who we really are.  <br>Christian: Exactly. That’s exactly right. Another analogy is: At night, when you dream, and then you wake up in the morning, it’s obvious that now you’re in the real world, and that was just a dream. Well, that’s how dying is. It’s just obvious. It’s so much more real. It’s more lucid. You know more about yourself. That was the dream.  <br>So, do you need to really get worked up? No. And while you’re here in the play, guess what? We’re allowed to have fun. It’s just a play. You don’t have to take things too seriously. We’re super serious as humans. Everything’s so serious. It’s actually not that serious. You can have joy and peace in all circumstances if you so choose.  <br><br><br>Host: It’s interesting because when you talk about it not being so serious, that really everything is okay, and when you talk about the experience of the first experience that you kind of feel like you messed up—where you were the fetus, you jumped, you’re like, “I’m done,” and then you saw this small life that you had and the ripple effect that it had—how does that make you feel about your own words and actions? What kind of importance do you place on it in your own life, having had that experience and knowing how the ripple effect can… that is how it is? How do you conduct yourself with the things you say, the things you think, and the things you project onto people? How do you navigate that with that knowledge?  <br>Christian: I have a lot of fear, and I have a lot of ego. So, the short answer is: Our quality of intent is important. That’s a term from Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer.  <br>In my own case, I try to honestly appraise the quality of my intent. Why am I doing what I’m doing right now? Why am I saying what I’m saying? Why am I doing this activity that I’m doing? But I’m not a special person. I’m deeply flawed. I’m going to ask my wife. She has to tolerate many difficulties that I bring to bear. I have a lot of fear, and she has to live with that too.  <br>So, I’m just saying that up front because that’s just how it is. But okay, so when you were asking the question, I understand you asked it on the tail of the comment that we don’t need to take things too seriously, but yet everything we do here on Earth is important. So, those two things can seem like they’re opposites, but this is a good example of, in the spiritual context, two things can appear opposite but are both simultaneously very much true because of where we are in duality.  <br>It gets confusing trying to pick, “Well, which one is it?” because we like A or B—hot or cold, up or down, left or right. Which one is it? It’s both. All is well, and we don’t have to take anything too seriously ever, and yet it’s very important what we do and how we affect each other.  <br>We are here to actualize love. We’re here to be love, and that can mean all sorts of things. It’s not just one type of behavior. I think especially in certain religious traditions, we try to codify what loving intent means. It’s this thing and not that thing. We always do this, and we never do this. Love is much bigger than that.  <br>Love can mean all sorts of different things in all sorts of different circumstances. It can mean, in many cases, peace in the face of great violence. Sometimes it may mean standing up and taking action that may even appear violent in order to protect someone or do the best that we can in the play where we see it needs to be done.  <br>We might need to choose assertiveness, or we might need to step back and accept. There’s a spectrum for all these kinds of decisions. One of the essays I wrote in the book is called “Loving Intent Transcends All Axes.” What I mean is, in all these spectrums—should I do this or this? Should I be this way or this way?—love can operate through both or in the middle.  <br>So, we develop as spirits not just our ability to choose one or the other end of the spectrum, but we also improve our ability to choose which end of the spectrum and when. So, we improve not only our strength in some direction—like, say, bravery—but we also work on when to choose to deploy or bring forward that quality.  <br>Discernment is the other big thing we’re working to do. What discernment am I talking about? Not just discernment about looking at things in the correct way. I’m talking about discernment of intention—what intention are we bringing to bear in this certain circumstance?  <br>The good news is, this is so important in the context of your question: The quality of our intention in the smallest moment is what matters. It’s what’s so powerful. The ability to, in this—it may appear to be such a small, tiny thing on the Earth’s surface—but to the spirit, to bring love to bear, or to face one’s fears, or to face one’s grief, or to face one’s addiction, or whatever other thing we’re here to deal with—in the smallest way, to improve ourselves in the smallest way, is incredibly powerful.  <br>Those are the celebrated moments of our lives. It’s not how many objects we moved around or how much money we made. None of that’s going to matter. That’s all play. It’s play content. It’s props on the stage. What matters is: Who are you? What have you done in a simple moment?  <br>It does not have to be physically moving a mountain. There’s a beautiful near-death experience I forget whose this was, but there was a gentleman who shared that he had an NDE, and he died. He had a life review, and he became aware that one of the most celebrated moments of his entire life was when he was a child. He was on a road trip with his family, and they stopped at some rest stop. His parents asked him to go down to this river nearby and get a bucket of water because they didn’t have water.  <br>So, he was carrying this bucket of water back to the car, and he decided to go out of his way to water a dry tree. He let some of the water out of his way, so it took him a little bit of effort. He watered this tree, brought the bucket up to his parents, and never thought of it again. That was the most beautiful, celebrated moment of his life because he did it out of love and selflessness and just joy—not because there was any way he could benefit. In fact, it was a little bit difficult for him, and he did it anyway.  <br>Similarly, here, you can be a paraplegic in your own bed. You can’t move a finger, but you are a powerful spirit. It doesn’t matter that you can’t move a finger. That’s a play. It’s not really what you are. What you are is the beautiful consciousness who is in this experience now, who gets to choose. Can you meet this with love and openness and acceptance right now?  <br>The smallest moment—that is where the power is. The small, beautiful moments of just meeting our own fear, choosing compassion, choosing vulnerability, choosing to own our own crap in a simple way—that is where the rubber meets the road.  <br>So, that’s a long-winded answer to your question, but I think for everybody, that is going to mean something different. For everybody, that means something different. For some people, it depends on what we’re here to face and what our challenges are. Everybody has different challenges.  <br>We look like we’re all together on the surface, and most people are pretty… most people have a lot of pain going on. How do you meet that pain? How do you honor yourself? How do you honor the person next to you? How do you decide? How do you identify when your intention is not the best it can be?  <br>How do you choose joy in the midst of this context? Are you so calloused over by life that you can’t dance with the child who’s playing next to you any longer, or can you dance? Those are the beautiful choices because what survives is spirit, which is consciousness.  <br>The context goes away. It’s going to be gone, but what you retain is the experience and the choices you made while you were here. What kind of choices did you make? It’s not about the size of the context. It’s about the quality of even the smallest choices.  <br><br><br>Host: I love that, Christian. I love that. But I want to kind of wrap this up in a bigger spiritual question way, I guess, and ask you: I told you about the way everybody that is watching this knows how I started the channel and started this journey for myself in this direction. You’re here having this conversation, and you’ve talked to other people. What is happening? What is it?  <br>What is happening with all of this? It seems so… in such a very… to me, a very… maybe the last 20 years where it’s almost like we’re allowed to have all this information on Earth now, or it’s coming to us in different ways. What is that? What do you think is happening as far as… is the Earth ready for it? Is it a planned kind of thing, like, “Okay, we’re going to have more spirit energy here now,” or “We’re going to have more communication,” or are there just more people here that have done this so many times that they’re not that surprised anymore by the fact that there is more to this? They just kind of instinctively know because we’ve been here so many times now.  <br>What is going on? What do you think is going on?  <br>Christian: Well, I think that the human kind collective consciousness is going through what we call the awakening. It’s just a term. Basically, each one of us is a part of the collective consciousness of humanity, which is a group, but it’s also its own thing.  <br>The collective consciousness goes through certain high-level acts of the play, and we entertain certain types of experience for certain durations, which on Earth may seem like very long durations. We’re at a point now where we are shifting, and we are attempting to reach a higher vibration as a collective.  <br>But in order to do that, it means a lot of the old crap that we have been very deeply associated with for a long time has to be faced and felt and healed. So, the collective consciousness of humanity has built up a lot of thought momentum. What I mean by that is, in the astral and higher realms, thoughts are like physical objects that you can interact with.  <br>So, when you’ve got thousands of years of human thinking one thing, there’s a lot of thought momentum in that direction. So, we are dealing with the historical momentum of the species and the Earth. That whole sea has a lot of very low vibration, previously entertained experiences and perceptions in it—a lot of very old beliefs that are just deeply rooted within us.  <br>Take one for instance that’s very dear in my heart—racism. Racism is an example. It’s just a simple ego trick of believing in validating the self by validating one’s group at the expense of others. It’s very simple, and it’s a reflection of fear.  <br>So, that’s just one example of a pattern that is in the collective consciousness of humanity that we are in the process of undoing. In order to undo it, the higher vibrational energies that come in tend to prompt us to face that crap, and it means that there can be some strong last hurrahs.  <br>I personally feel we’ve experienced some of that in the United States in the last five years, and that happens because there are still a lot of people who hold on to those beliefs that have a lot of thought momentum.  <br>So, there are non-physical beings helping us to bring higher energy into this system, but there’s friction as that happens because now we need to actually… now the rubber has to meet the road. Now that the higher vibration is here, we’re either going to grow—which means face our own fear—and growth is love, or not.  <br>Now, who’s growing? This is super important. Individuals. We’re talking about the collective, but it’s individuals. It’s every person listening right now and everybody else—one at a time—doing their best to meet this experience with love rather than fear and ego and the belief that rises by the ego.  <br>It’s an individual process. I’m a fan of the quote—I forget the exact words—but it’s something like, “At first, I was clever, so I tried to change the world. Now I’m wise, so I changed myself.” The idea is that you don’t have to worry about anybody else. You simply choose how you meet your experience and how you interact with those around you.  <br>Most of us have a lot more fear than we’re willing to… so there is a lot of work for each individual to do, typically. But the good news is, one person who awakens—one person who discovers who they are, meets their own crap, who really is authentic even for a time—is much more powerful than many who are lost in the dream of fearful thoughts.  <br>An awakened person is powerful, including the collective consciousness. It’s like a beacon of light in the sea that attracts others. If you imagine a big pool of water and there’s lights going on, the more that go on, the more the rest of them stay like, “Oh, look, the lights are changing,” even though they may not be consciously aware of it. It gives permission to everybody else.  <br>An individual who is awakened tends to shine very brightly and has more power because love is the true power. Fear has no real power. Love has incredible power, even if you physically can’t do anything at all.  <br>So, as we choose love and try to bring love into our personal experience, we help bring that vibration of love into this place, and the collective will grow. I personally am very hopeful. I know a lot of people are very fearful about the prospects and what appears on the surface, but I actually feel that the vibration is increasing, and we are doing better.  <br>I have a lot of hope for our goal, our destination. It may not happen in a year, but it doesn’t need to happen in a human lifetime. We’re not one lifetime anyway.  <br><br><br>Host: That’s right. I think a lot of people… that is the thing right there. That ego side of us wants to see it all. We want it to happen right now and see all these wonderful things happen, but you’re right. There’s no… we’re so linear. We think of such time restraints for everything. So, you’re right. That is what ultimately is like, “It’s all okay,” because this is all happening, and it will happen in its own time.  <br>Christian: Yeah.  <br>Host: Christian, your book is A Walk in the Physical. Oh my gosh, I can’t wait to read it. But tell me where else people can find you. What other stuff are you doing? Where can they find you?  <br>Christian: Sure. So, I have a website, awalkinthephysical.com. It’s been my blog site for years. There’s a page on the site for the book. The book is available for free online. On the book page, there’s a third link down—a link to a Google Books entry for the entire book. You just click “Read for Free,” and the whole book is there.  <br>I think it’s very important that we share this information. It’s not about money. I really want to share. The book is something that I feel is important. I worked with spirit over the years and brought forth chunks of the time. I technically wrote the book, but I feel like it was very much spirit-led.  <br>It’s very non-linear. I’ve tried to create a reality model that is encouraging and helps remind the individual of what they already know. I have nothing new to give, but I can at least provide a framework for exploration. I think that’s something that is important.  <br>So, yeah, that’s the idea behind the book. I feel like, to be honest, the book is my life’s work. I knew I just knew I had to get it into the physical. I don’t know what’s going to happen with it. I don’t have any expectations. I just know that I needed to make it physical in the way that it is now, and I’m happy and honored to do that.  <br>As for how to contact me, my email is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a> You can also reach out on Facebook if you’d like to talk. I’m happy to talk to anybody. We just need to be there and encourage each other. All of us are brothers and sisters walking on the path.  <br>I’m not a special person. I’m just another wilderness journeyer, but I’m happy to greet you on the path, and we can talk about the weeds. We’re both in the weeds right now.  <br>As a closing thought, I just want to say: For whoever is listening right now, please do be reminded that you are loved. You are a loving, loved, beautiful, precious, powerful being—you specifically, not just a super general love. You are known, and you are loved. There is nothing to fear.  <br>I hope that you can be reminded of that as you go about your daily life, which is important and meaningful. You’re performing a great service today by being human and walking the human journey. So, thank you for doing that. I’m sure it’s been a while since someone thanked you for being human, but thank you for being human, even though you don’t remember anything else.  <br>Thank you for being human, and don’t take it too seriously. Just have fun, do your best to love those around you, to love yourself, and to engage the beauty of the world. Just do that. It’s a beautiful, powerful thing. This is an opportunity. We are in the opportunity right now. This moment is the opportunity.  <br>We’ve come all this way. Everyone listening today, you’ve come a really long way through all your physical life, from journeys that you can’t even remember to now. What will we do with it?  <br>Host: Yeah, make it count, but don’t take it too seriously.  <br>Christian: Yeah, make it count in a joyful way. Be yourself. Be authentic because when we’re ourselves, it’s joyful.  <br>Host: Thank you so much, Christian. I just thank you so much for having me too.  <br>Christian: Thank you. Thank you for your work.  <br>Host: Oh, you’re more than welcome. Okay, bye.  <br>Christian: Bye. Thanks, bye, everybody. Thank you for tuning in.  <br>Host: Thank you, Christian. I will talk to you again soon. Yeah, have a good one. Bye-bye.  ]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2021/intuitive-psychic-reading-chatting-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2021/INTUITIVE PSYCHIC READING - Chatting With Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:02:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[LET'S TALK ABOUT PRE-BIRTH EXPERIENCES WITH CHRISTIAN SUNDBERG]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=VEJWH6wEBdQ  <br>19 NOV 2021<br><br><br>Hello everyone, I'm Shannon Torrance, and welcome to Magic is Real, a podcast focused on proof of the afterlife, whose mission is to bring hope and inspiration to others and to spread the word that death is only an illusion. If these interviews resonate with you and you want to hear more like them, you can support the podcast by liking, subscribing, and sharing with like-minded friends. Thank you so much, and thank you for being a part of the Magic is Real family. I wish you peace, light, and love always.  <br>Hello, Magic is Real listeners. I am very honored today because my guest, Christian Sundberg, is here, and he's going to share some insights that I think are so interesting, thought-provoking, and different from what we normally do here. You're used to me interviewing near-death experiencers—people who have crossed over to the other side and come back to share what happened when they "died."  <br>Christian is actually the author of a book called A Walk in the Physical. He is a regular family man who did not die. However, he does have what's called pre-birth experiences, which we will talk about. As a child, he had memories of his existence before this life, forgot them, and later, when he was 30 years old, started to meditate and began to recover those memories.  <br>Christian, thank you so much for being here. I'm really excited to have this conversation with you. You have so much to share.  <br>Christian: Thank you so much. It's an honor to be here.  <br>Shannon: Yeah, so your story is a little different and a little more difficult to ask questions about off the bat because what we're talking about is really very non-linear. Time is an illusion, and so why don't you explain a little bit about that? I know it's hard to ask you to start here because there is no real start time. You've told this story a million times. Take it away as you interpret it.  <br><br><br>Christian: Sure, thank you. Before I get started, I just want to say—and I have to disclaim this every time we try to talk about these topics—that language is vastly insufficient. Our language is based in our world of form. Words are symbols that are based in our context, and who we truly are vastly and deeply transcends this entire context. It transcends duality itself. So there's just no language at all that can possibly touch the depth and the breadth and the realness of these topics.  <br>I just think that's really important to say because I feel very much like every time we even open our mouths, as soon as we speak, we've already ruined it. We're just wrong. So, okay, that being said, to speak to the time question: linear time is a construct. It is a tool. It is specific to this local simulation we might say that we're experiencing right now.  <br>We tend to think of everything in a very linear way because that is how we experience sequence here on Earth. There is a higher sequence that I can't possibly articulate, but there is a sequence of the soul you might say—maybe an evolutionary sequence or something.  <br>So, I do have these pre-birth memories that I'll try to describe briefly. I'll try to be somewhat brief, as you mentioned. I share it many times. I don't want to bore people with the same story. But these memories are both incredibly ancient and also simultaneously right now, alive, active right now. They're not like earthly events that are kind of in the past and limited and defined. These are deeply personal, almost intrinsic to who I am, and both ancient and also right now.  <br><br><br>In summary, I remember a long time ago—and I know this is going to sound really strange to some people—I know I'm going out on a limb when I describe this. Like you said, I'm just a normal family guy, and I've been a working professional for 19 years, so I know how this sounds. But I remember before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical, and I was so deeply inspired by this being because I could feel in him the quality of his nature, his essence, like the substance of what he was.  <br>It was so beautiful and so full of power and joy and freedom and expansiveness and refinement. I just don't know how to describe this, but I was deeply inspired by this being. So I set off to do this, and I had many life experiences since then—again, in linear time—many experiences since then.  <br>The majority of my pre-birth memories are of a time somewhat immediately preceding this life, after I had taken a long break from being physical a number of times. I decided I was taking a very long break, and I remember a guide coming to me and asking me, "Are you ready to go back? Are you ready to go back yet?" and putting him off for a while, and finally saying, "Okay, I'm ready to go back now."  <br>I reviewed with this guide what I can only describe as my state—like who I am, who I have been, and what qualities I had mastered or were a part of me. It's really hard to explain, but maybe you might even say like virtues or something. But what had I done in the past, and what would it be best for me now to work on and to integrate?  <br>It was very obvious the thing that I needed to work on. I don't like the word "work on." It's not like a human task or something, but I really felt this deep fear in me that had bested me in a previous experience. I should say I didn't feel it in that time in a real way because fear itself isn't actually real, but I knew that I had this unevolvingness in a certain direction that was extreme.  <br>In a previous physical experience, this fear had led me to become overcome. I had been very egoic, and I had hurt a lot of other people. So I saw this, and I knew, "Wow, if I could integrate this, it would be amazing. There would be so much growth, so much personal expansion, and expansion of the whole, actually, if I could face and feel and integrate this very, very low vibration that I had engaged in a previous experience."  <br>It was so extreme that I asked, "Is it even possible? Has any being in creation ever done this?" And the God community said to me, "Yes, and you have all the time available to do so. There's no hurry."  <br>I just knew that if it was possible, I would do it. I said, "If it's possible, I will do it," because I knew the depth of what I am and what we are—the completely unbelievably powerful, immortal spirit that we are. I just knew that this was an incredible opportunity, even though it might be very challenging.  <br>So they brought me a lifetime that was perfect for this intention of mine, and I reviewed that life and I accepted it. Then I accepted the veil. Okay, so the veil is just a word, but this is the thing I remember most, and it's at the forefront of my mind every day because I can feel it even now in this life.  <br><br><br>I remember being in the state, and then the veil is like a surrender to an energy where your vibration plummets down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, so low in such a way that your knowing is cut off, and your connectedness disappears. It's like a racing or a losing of all that you are down into this very, very low vibration, dense, specific vantage point.  <br>I like to describe it like an amp, a sound amplifier that produces a pitch. It's got a knob, and then you turn the knob down. It goes down, and then when you get to the bottom, you turn down some more, and then more, and then down, down, down, down, down, down, down, more. That's what it felt like to come all the way down, down, down, down into this very dense, limited physical experience.  <br>This wasn't for this life. It was an immediately preceding life, and I was in the womb then. I was in the state pre-birth but physical, and within seconds, I was like, "I'm not doing this. This is so low vibration. This is so dark. This is not happening. I am not going to tolerate this for a lifetime. This is ridiculous."  <br><br><br>So I summoned my might, my strength, and I fought my way out. I pushed my way back past the veil, and I was successful in doing that. But I became immediately aware that I had killed the fetus. I killed the body that was to be mine, and I had a life review, just like near-death experiences describe.  <br>I became aware of all the people that were affected by my life, even though it was super short. I knew that my fear and my decision to reject the experience caused the mother profound grief. Then I saw, in ripples away from the mother, hundreds of other people—hundreds of other people whose lives were going to be made more difficult because of my fear and how it affected the mother.  <br>So, okay, I had wasted that opportunity, but I still wanted to do this. I still had this intention. So they brought me this life, and I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail. This life was not as perfect as the other one was. The other one was super appropriate for my intention. This one was pretty good. It wasn't perfect, but it was good enough.  <br><br><br>I remember reviewing what I can only describe as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold. It was like, metaphorically, if you take a tree and lay it on its side and you start at the trunk and you work your way out to the branches, it was like that.  <br>I reviewed even in terms of numerical ages. I remember reviewing how this life would likely unfold and what it would be like to be me—to be Christian, the human character—what it would be like to have this experience, and what was very likely and unlikely to happen.  <br>I knew, for example, that it was very likely that in my early 20s, I would be traumatized, deeply crushed by an experience, and that that trauma would give me the opportunity to re-engage this very low vibration fear. And that did happen. My body is 41 right now, but when I was 22, I experienced a traumatic event, and I had PTSD for about six or seven years after that.  <br>It was only after really facing and processing that deep trauma and really integrating a lot of that—doing that work and then taking up a long-term meditation practice—that these memories began to return.  <br>But anyway, at the time, I reviewed it, and I was incredibly excited. I knew this was like I was going to be taking this way further in one experiential direction than I'd ever gone before. It's like, metaphorically, if you start in the middle at base camp, and every time you have an experience, you go out a certain distance away from base camp and maybe set a flag or something.  <br>This is just a silly metaphor, but I'm just trying to describe vibrationally. It was like I knew that in this life, I was going to be going really, really far out in one vibrational direction, way past my last flag, so to speak—like I was going to be entering the wilderness, very challenging territory, in a very deep way in one specific direction.  <br>I was so excited at being given the opportunity to do that, and I knew that being given a human life was like the most precious, amazing gift possible. It was like being handed the most beautiful, precious gift in the world, and I was so honored that I was being given the chance to do this and to play this character because there's only so many, and there's so much experience work that goes into the whole simulation—all of our lives here.  <br>So to be given the chance to be a human was so precious. Okay, so I remember then there was a moment to say yes to the life, and I don't remember that moment, but I remember then being in a waiting area, like this area of light, and being ready to go.  <br>Then this guy came to me and grabbed my attention, like, "Go now, like right now, right now is the time," really getting my attention, and I'm like, "Okay, okay, now." So next, I was in this room that I can only describe as like a mechanic shop or a pit stop or something—some kind of mechanics area where these beings that were very mechanical in nature—I like to call them tinkerers—were there.  <br>They did this thing for me where they made the veil fit for me. They made it because it's like organic, it's personal. So they do this thing where they take the energy of the body and the life and the circumstances, and then the soul has very rich, personal, deep qualities, and they do this thing where they make it fit, make it all work.  <br>Then I remember them asking me one last time, "Are you sure? Are you sure you want to do this?" because I knew once I said yes, I was in for the ride. There's no getting off the roller coaster once you press this button.  <br>I said yes, and then once again, I felt my vibration plummet down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, and this time, I just focused on not fighting it. This time, I just was like, "Okay, just don't resist. Just let it happen. Let it do what it will do to me."  <br>I felt my knowing be cut off. My connectedness disappeared, and I felt alone and dark and dense, like arriving to the vacuum of space. It's just metaphorically like where there's no heat, there's no substance, there's no air, there's nothing. It's just emptiness and yet denseness. That's how it felt to arrive to this place in the womb.  <br>Okay, so then I was there for a while. So I made it, and then I was there for a while, and then I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this. This is so low vibration. This is so dark. There is no way I'm going to tolerate this. I am not going to have it."  <br>So once again, I began to summon my might to fight my way out, and as I did that, the most holy moment from my whole human experience came to me. I don't know how to describe this other than saying the Great Spirit of God—the I Am, the Great Source—I don't know what. There's no word, but the Source, the I Am of all, came to me.  <br>It communicated to me telepathically, and it showed me like I expanded back out, and it showed me all that I am. I felt all the stars, all the universe within me. I felt our own sun, Earth, churning with bliss, just like the very act of the sun burning on itself was so like raging bliss.  <br>I felt all of this expansion and freedom, and the Spirit said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And it was so powerful and deep in me, and it calmed me. I was like, "Oh man, oh man, if that's what I am, that's wonderful."  <br>I knew that I didn't have to fight. I could let go, so I let go into the simple existence of being in the womb, and I was there for a while. Then I remember the day I was born, and I remember the feeling. There was no intellectual understanding at all. There was just an experience of extreme sensory information—sight, sound, temperature, touching.  <br>I remember looking up at the nurses who were there taking care of me and having so much love for them and wondering, "What is this place? Where am I?" But I had no understanding at all of where I was.  <br>I know that they say that babies can't see, and so I don't understand this, but I definitely saw the nurses, and I have one memory of the image of the room, the layout of the room, the day I was born. Then I have no memory after that at all for a few years, except for just a very sparse week—a couple of memories of being in the crib, but nothing substantive.  <br>But then as I got older, I remember being in a diaper and learning how to walk, and I remember calling upon these pre-birth memories at that time and looking at the flowchart memory as a way to kind of cheat—like, "What's going to happen now? What's going to happen next?"  <br>That ability diminished as I aged. As I got to the age of maybe five or six, I couldn't cheat anymore. I became more and more deeply associated with the identity of being Christian, and I didn't have that memory anymore. I didn't remember any of this, as you mentioned, for my 20s until I was 30 years old when I took up a long-term meditation practice.  <br>I certainly wasn't expecting anything like this. I was just meditating at first because it felt like a relief in meditation, and I was reading the work of the physicist and consciousness explorer Tom Campbell at the time. Tom recommends meditating as a form of investigation—like, just go find out, go see what your awareness is.  <br>So I was doing that, and then after a few months, I had my first non-physical experience and out-of-body experience, and it was so profoundly jarring and shocking to me because it was so real. It was not subtle. It was very paradigm-shaking.  <br>Then within a few months after that—probably a similar time; I don't remember exactly what it was—these memories were just there again. It was like someone had just blown leaves off the ground. It was the most normal thing in the world.  <br>Now, from the perspective I have now, to me, the strange thing is that we don't remember what we are. What we are is much, much greater than the character that we play.  <br>Yeah, so that's a quick summary. I mean, I left out certain elements, and it's really difficult to describe, but for context, hopefully, that'll be helpful.  <br>Shannon: Well, to me, it sounded very clear, and I'm sure it does to most. You're very articulate and eloquent, and I feel like you've really sort of figured out a way to tell it in a linear fashion that makes sense through our paradigm.  <br>One thing that strikes me is that it really feels like what you just shared is sort of like a behind-the-scenes of a near-death experience because people who have NDEs experience a life review often—not always, depending on how deep in their journey they go—but we don't really know what happens after that because they haven't stayed long enough.  <br>I feel like you filled in those blanks very well. You're able to fill in those blanks very well because we all know there's something. We spiritual people know there's something going on. We're like, "Are we aliens? Why though? Why do we have to learn lessons? What's the greater meaning of it all? Where does it even come from?"  <br>Obviously, you don't even have all of those answers, but what you do have is a pretty good glimpse, and it actually makes so much sense based on my own life experience and my spiritual awakening as to why we're here.  <br>As I've gotten older, I start to see the patterns. I know what your thing was—fear. My general fear—there's a specific fear. Okay, yeah, so a specific fear, and then, but you know, I've noticed that the themes of my life—the areas that I need to work on—I'm still working on.  <br>I've gone through 12-step recovery, and it's like I still come up against these same things—not using my voice, not speaking up. It's all voice-related, and I'm just sharing this because I think it's pretty interesting.  <br>I was a kid with a birthmark on her face. Kids called me ugly. I shut down because I had anxiety, so I was selectively mute, didn't speak, had to go through therapy, then became an actor and a singer and a performer, but then just lost my voice again two years ago.  <br>It's just the voice thing keeps coming up, so that's just a small bit of it without getting too much into it because this interview isn't about me, but it is interesting how I start to see, "Oh yeah, not using my voice, being a people pleaser, not feeling lovable without external validation."  <br>Fortunately, I've healed so much of that. I feel like I'm in such a different place where I don't feel that lack of self-love anymore. In fact, it's the opposite. However, I'm like, "Oh, but then these little things come up where you're like, 'I'm still being tested. I'm still having to work it out.'"  <br>As you said, it's not that you don't like to use that term, but yeah, it feels like there is a lot of working out of things, and that's sort of why we keep coming up against the same obstacles.  <br>Christian: Yeah, I want to say there are two things that come to mind that I think are meaningful. So, I've had a lot of people ask, "Well, how do I find out what my purpose is? Why am I here?"  <br>Of course, that's an extremely personal question, and there's not just one action you can sit down and do, but I'll just make at least this one comment that's pertinent to that question.  <br>As you said, the thing that we're here to integrate—I like the word "integrate" because it's really about learning it and knowing it, not learning in an intellectual way. There may be intellect involved, but it's an experiential integration of something, and that thing tends to keep rising up into our experience over and over and over.  <br><br><br>If we come with something specific, it's usually lined up pretty well that you will get a chance to engage it. So, one clue is to look at your life, and often it's the weak leg—the thing that's difficult for you—that keeps rising up over and over.  <br>Maybe it's a certain quality of relationship, maybe it's a certain strength or virtue or something that you're struggling to engage, maybe it's a self-perception you really have trouble with that you just can't get over. Whatever it is, I'm just encouraging that it is often the case that if it keeps rising up over and over, pay attention because it may be related to why you've come.  <br>The other thing that what you said reminds me of is one of the qualities that we come to Earth to master—again, these words are very weak—but one of the qualities we come to develop is the quality that Robert Schwartz talks about. I have not read a lot of Robert Schwartz's books, but in the short bit that I did read, he talked about this, and I thought it was really apt.  <br>Robert Schwartz is a gentleman who's written books about pre-birth planning, and there was a term he used in it that I feel is very meaningful, and it's the virtue of self-referencing or the quality of self-referencing.  <br>So, what does that mean? We come from higher systems where our connectedness is known fully. We feel our connectedness all the time with each other and with the whole, and so we draw great strength from each other. We're also all loving, compassionate—our true nature is love and compassion and support.  <br>If there's any weakness or need, it's quite natural for us to go to others and find that strength there. However, on Earth, it can be a very different story. We can't feel each other all the way. We can't even really communicate. We don't sense all of what the other person is experiencing.  <br>So, what happens is we end up feeling an experience that feels very personal and very cut off—like, "I'm just in my little brain, my little body, and you're over there. You're an outside person. I only feel me. I don't feel you."  <br>When we're all acting like that, what can happen is it can force the individual to rely on one's self, on one's own strength, and that is actually a quality. I know that we, of course, love is about selflessness, but I'm focusing in this moment on just this one quality, which I think is very important, and that is the quality of being able to draw strength from within and find one's own place, one's own voice, one's own truth.  <br>Whatever it means, because that does take courage. That is something that can really be done here in a way that cannot be done when there are far less constraints. So, I just thought I'd mention that. I think that's an interesting point.  <br>Shannon: Yeah, and that's sort of why I like to share these stories. I think they bring up some interesting thoughts from you.  <br>One of the questions I also have is—I know this is hard to explain—when you went into meditation, did this sort of come up all at once, or was it slowly over time that you started to remember things?  <br><br><br>Christian: I'd say the majority of it was all at once, and then as I was aware of that, naturally, I started focusing on it because that's really interesting.  <br>Once I began to focus on it and as I continued to meditate, I found other things attached to it all over the place. So, other memories opened up. For instance, I became aware of just a couple of brief snippets of past physical experiences I've had—not a lot, but they're all tied together.  <br>As an example, I'm aware that I was once a woman who had given birth and was pregnant a second time, and I remember being afraid of having to give birth a second time because of the pain of child labor. That fear of that pain—that fear of being unable to escape pain—was the same energy that I'm facing in this life, though under a different circumstance.  <br>So, I'm aware of that connection. It's not different, and it was me. You know, you think when you have other lives, those are other people. No, it's you. You have an experience of doing this thing or being this thing or entertaining this form for a while. Same exact me, but the same fear from that experience to this experience.  <br>Shannon: That's right. And when I know—I'm sorry, no, I was just going to say—well, I want you to continue, but I'll have another question. Go ahead.  <br>Christian: I was just going to say that there are times when I reach a point in the memory where I'm very curious about something, and I try to probe, and I get this "No, okay, that's not like that. That's no. There's no need to go there."  <br>I respect that. I know it's easy for the ego to get a hold of these ideas. I know that it is best for me to not push where I'm not supposed to push. I just allow what is there, and that's good. I think it might interfere with my own journey if I push too much.  <br>But with what I do remember, it's been very helpful for me because now when these pains arise, when the fear rises, I'm inspired by my own intention. I know what I'm here to do, so I can very actively use the opportunity rather than be overcome by it.  <br>Shannon: Right, that's yeah. And that's the hardest part of being here, which is not easy. It's the hardest part of being a person. I know I was just thinking this week, "Okay, this particular thing keeps popping up, and I know I need to take contrary action in some way."  <br>I know that ultimately, this is why I'm here, so why do I keep wanting to go back to this thing? I guess I'm like, "That's not serving me. I know that, and it's not helping me evolve, but man, the ego gets involved, and you're like, 'But I want that thing.'"  <br>So, I get it, but I also wanted to know what you think about past life regression if you have any thoughts about it.  <br>Christian: I don't have many thoughts about it. I once entertained the idea of becoming a past life regressionist.  <br>Of course, when we're here and we're veiled, it's an extremely complex energetic process. How do I describe this? The veil is effective, and each individual is so unique.  <br>I don't think it's as simple as doing some physical action, some process, and then getting that information. Now, I think it is very much possible to get that information because that<br>I don't think it's as simple as you know, doing some physical action, some process, and then getting that information. I think it is very much possible to get that information because that's what we are. It's there. It's just that the way that the local human personality uses information, there needs to be a healthy element of skepticism, I feel, in that because often it's our imagination or it's our ego. It takes a great deal of discernment and familiarity with the deeper aspects of the self, the subtle, what appear to be subtle at first.<br>They're actually not subtle at all when you actually go there, get there. But the subtler aspects of itself, it can be very easy to misinterpret those. So, I think it's a wonderful process overall, and I think if someone's interested, that'd be great because even if you may get past life information or maybe if you don't, maybe you're still getting useful information that's not about a past life, but it might still help you if you're open to it.<br>That's actually a really good way to put it. I've tried past life regression meditations and with other people, and just always felt like, besides the fact that half the time I fell asleep, the other half was, I guess I'll not make something up, but I'm like, I don't know if I'm not making something up just to have something to say. But at the same time, as a medium, I know that that's part of what I do is when you're reading someone, it feels like you're making it up, but it's actually divinely inspired. <br>Not all of it, it's deciding what's your thought versus what's coming from actual source, which is, like you said, it is subtle and yet it's not so subtle, which is really interesting. But yeah, I just wondered what you thought of that because I think it's such an imperfect science, I guess, and when I say science, I mean that loosely.<br>So, I feel this is one of the reasons that meditation is such a very helpful habit. I won't even call it an action, but a way to utilize time and intention because I feel that it is almost impossible to differentiate higher information, we'll call it, from the spiritual information from outside ourselves within a spiritual context from the local if one is not familiar with one's own thoughts. What I mean is, you need to have a real, you need to feel and know your own relationships, your own thoughts. If you're lost and thinking all the time, that's a very difficult environment from which to receive that higher information.<br>I feel that it takes a lot of humility and a lot of willingness to actually go see exactly what your own thinking is, go find what your own awareness is beneath thought, and become familiar with what thinking is, what it feels like. You know, that's a thought, that's a thought, that's a thought. As you gain that familiarity with your own thinking, which by comparison is extremely dense, it can feel quick in the human mind. You know, it can feel like you're having a hundred thoughts a second if you've been thinking a lot, but even those thoughts are very forceful and dense, whereas the deeper parts of us, if we're in a state of clarity and peace, the deeper information tends to come lightning fast, all at once, and as a knowing, not as a bunch of new thoughts that are like your thoughts.<br>I don't know how else to describe it. You described it better than that, but it's very personal too. Like, I'm not trying to qualify for anyone else because every single person's walk is unique. I would never try to qualify that for someone else. I'm just trying to describe in my own case, I know that meditation in a consistent way is very important because otherwise, I won't have the clarity of mind to have that sense. I've had some interaction with non-physical friends. <br>Think of it this way, like they're at a super high vibration, and we're kind of really low, so there needs to be a meeting kind of in the middle somewhere where there's a vibrational connection. They need to come down, we need to be at a higher vibration, and that doesn't mean forcing yourself to be in a good mood and happy. It means you need to actually work through a lot of fear, you need to actually be fully present and feel the power of life that you are within yourself so that you are in that open, accepting place, and that is a place that is conducive to vibrationally having that interaction.<br>I'm so glad you said that. That was going to be my next question: how can you raise your vibration to reconnect with that part of yourself and everything around you? I've also heard you speak a lot about, I know that you don't claim to know the answers or to say this is exactly the way that it works, but I found it really interesting because I think so many people think that heaven is a place and hell is a place. I understand them to be more of a state of consciousness but also not just heaven, but all these other dimensions of reality. <br>The idea that time, there is no time, I mean, it's not a linear thing, it's happening all at once. I just basically want you to riff on this. It's not a specific question, but it's so hard to even formulate a question, and I know that you can't formulate a definitive answer, but there is something that I believe that I'd love to hear you talk about, which is the idea that there are many different parallel realities, dimensions, and that they're all actually right here.<br><br><br>So, let me jump back to your comment about heaven as a place and hell. First of all, Earth can be experienced in a heavenly or hellish way depending on our own vibration. What that means is, our true nature, this is super important, our true nature is already total love, freedom, joy, power, creativity, total love. <br>That is the constant. It cannot be truly lost. It is the bedrock upon which all experience is built. This is such an important message, and it's real. I'm not just making this up because it sounds nice. The foundation of all existence is breathtaking love and freedom of being. That's what we really are, but for the purposes of the expansion of consciousness and evolution, we choose to take sojourns into contrast, like here. This reality is just very high contrast potentially. What I mean is, the context itself is high definition, high state of separation, which is a very alien state. Being human is like that.<br>But while we're here, it's not that that state of high constraint is bad. It just has a very high opportunity to provoke fear, which to provoke our yet unevolvingness, especially as we buy into perceptions that are not in alignment with the truth of who we are. So, if we buy into a perception of I am unworthy of love, I am not free, I have no power, those are some of the biggest ones on Earth that everyone is terrified of deep down. <br>When we buy into those perceptions about ourselves and about the world, we take a vibrational step further away in the skin, buying into the perception because when you buy into it, now you are the being who feels unworthy of love and who feels that they have no power. When you are that being that is not in alignment with the enduring truth, and when I say you are the being, I don't mean you're fundamentally the being, I mean you're having an experience of being that being.<br>So, I'm defining in that way to start before I speak to the reality systems question because here on Earth, we can have heavenly or hellish experiences depending on our own thoughts, our own beliefs, our own perceptions about ourselves and the world, depending on how we utilize the physical experience. Earth is high contrast, can be hellish, can be heavenly. But meanwhile, are there other reality systems? Yes, many, many, very real systems, many of which are thought responsive. <br>So, if you go to a thought responsive system and you have a lot of fear and a lot of negative belief, let's say as a human personality, you learned a belief in hell, and then you go to a thought responsive reality and you're terrified, you may create a hellish reality immediately, instantaneously, that is very real, very tangible because of your own fear.<br>Simultaneously, in a thought responsive system, we can give rise to very beautiful things, and that is all. That is even just out here in the vibrational area where there's still great limits. There are thought responsive reality systems that are still of quite some, every reality system has rules. You know, in our reality, we got physics, we got all those properties of how matter behaves. That's part of our reality system. There are other reality systems with different rules. Some of them are still relatively far further out vibrationally or maybe someplace in between, whereas some are naturally much closer to, again, this is not duality. It's not even fundamental. <br>So, this whole thing is, this metaphor only goes so far, but for our thinking minds, there are many reality systems that are very close comparatively to the source that are places of unspeakable bliss and unspeakable beauty.<br>We can take even the things that we love and enjoy on Earth and give them even greater expression in these systems that have much less limitation. So, there are physical reality systems that are either physical in the way we experience now or physical in another way or even not or even completely different than what we can even imagine. <br>It doesn't have to even be a reality where you see an environment like we have here. We think reality is made of environments, but that's just because we consciousness are buying into a perception of an environment right now. There are many other ways we can experience reality as well. I'm just highlighting though that the bedrock of all of that, even the hellish experiences, is total love.<br>How can total love be the bedrock of even those hellish experiences? Because consciousness, spirit, is so bold and creative in its ambition to expand and refine in love that it will even go this far, like on Earth, to integrate experience and to expand. We will even do this. We're unconditionally loved so much that we are given the option to choose to have an experience where we do not consciously remember the unconditional love, and that hurts, but we chose to do it because it has so much potential. <br>So, I just want to highlight that, and again, these things are really difficult to speak to. There are real other systems. If you would like, put it this way, if you want to spend a thousand years in a green field with those you love, you may if you choose, but also we constantly seek to evolve and grow. So, eventually, you may choose, you know what, I'd like something a little more challenging now. It's all our choice.<br>So, right now, while we're here, I know we get lost in these stories of powerlessness and fear. I know, but this moment is the opportunity. This day, this place, this body, this social circumstance, this illness, whatever, is the opportunity. You are an immortal being, and you cannot die. <br>You will not die, but how you use this experience, the love that you bring into this experience or the fear that you integrate and overcome, not conquer, but the fear that you heal in this experience, you get to keep all of that, all the love, all the preciousness of experience, the taste of pumpkin pie, you get to keep that. So, it's all an opportunity. It's just very high contrast. So, the question is today, how will you use this opportunity today?<br>It's beautiful. It's a wonderful truth. We've just lost sight of it because we've come so deep into the experience of separation and so deep into availing that our species, our collective consciousness, is just at a relatively young place right now. We're still early in our evolution. We're just starting to wake up to the larger spiritual context in which we exist, the very real context, and that's okay. <br>That's wonderful. When you say that, because I love the way you said that, it was so inspiring and motivating. I would like to know a couple of things. One is, based on the fact that I love that you said that we live in a thought reflective reality, and I'm really sort of going down the rabbit hole with that lately, what do you think of the concept of manifestation as it pertains to that idea? Is manifestation possible?<br><br><br>Manifestation happens. It's just that in our reality system, it's very slow by comparison. Well, I mean, it tends to be very slow. It does not have to be very slow. Spirit can do whatever it wants. So, to us, things that seem miraculous may actually be no big deal. But in general, generally speaking, our reality system is very dense. Like, basically, it can feel impossible to, for instance, send this mug to Jupiter with my mind. It is not happening because that's not how the rules work here. <br>But our intention, our deepest intention, this is the thing. When people talk about manifestation, they sometimes focus on the thought forms only, that is the thinking we're having, but really, the power, the driving force, is the deeper intention, the deepest why, our deepest real focused want, our real why we're thinking the thought.<br>So, for instance, we might say, I want a new car. I want a new car. Did I manifest a new car yet? But really, what you may be vibrationally saying is, I feel powerless because I have no car. I feel powerless because I have no power, no car. I'm just saying that you can't trick the universe with who you really are. Your intention is your intention, and that, by the way, as a side tangent, I think is one of the reasons that facing and processing our own fear is so important and empowering. It's actually one of the reasons that evolved beings who are so richly loving and have conquered fear are powerful because they are able to wield an intention that is pure.<br>Let's put it this way, love has the true power. Fear only has power in the extremely limited local sense. Like, what I mean is, somebody might walk in my front door with a gun right now and shoot me if they so choose. They could do that, and my body would die. That is the extent of their power. That's it. Now, that may sound like a lot. It's not. It's nothing. It's fine. The true power is love. So, even so, then what we take that back to our conversation about vibrationally in a manifestation sense, loving intention, pure intention, has so much power, whereas an intention that's just kind of like a fear muttering or weak thoughts has very little force behind it.<br>So, that's one of the reasons why there's been studies like prayer can help people because if you're genuine and you really want to help the other, others are part of you, and you're gifting them that energy of pushing with your intention, so to speak, wishing them the best in a real, genuine, selfless way, that has an effect. Intention has an effect. So, we're all manifesting all the time, but when we have fear, as Tom Campbell says, actually, he says in this reality, you get what you fear. <br>What he means by that is the thing that you're resisting, that you because, like I said, you can't trick what you're really down there. If what you're really down there's trying to avoid something, unfortunately, or actually not unfortunately, it's only unfortunate to the human ego, okay, fortunately, we have the opportunity even to then face the things we fear here as they arise.<br>So, that was kind of a long-winded response, but yes, I loved the response. I actually had another question, but then I forgot it, so I jumped to that one. But no, that was me. I know that there was another question I had, and I'm sure I'll kick myself when I edit this and watch back and say, why didn't I ask that? But I think I did want to touch on what you had been speaking about about our essence being pure love, light. There is no way to destroy that. <br>That's what it is. So, how, why is it that we come here? I know we have the veil, and I'm sure the veil, I've always assumed the veil is there because if we knew it all, we wouldn't be challenged to figure it out without this higher knowing. So, it kind of helps us because if we are grounded in this reality, then we do have to sort of take everything seriously. If we were born knowing it was just an illusion, we'd be like, I don't know, whatever, I don't care.<br>So, why, and I know that people have free will, and I know that people are reacting out of fear, and it's just so striking to me how many people choose the fear-based reaction: violence, hate, discrimination, all of these, war. It's just why. <br>I don't even really know what my question is. It's just something that's so profound to me, and part of that question involves or part of that musing involves why do people, some people, do you think, because you're not the only one, and there are other people that have these memories, and then there are people who are chosen to have near-death experiences so that they can become aware and be reminded of their true essence. What do you think about the whole concept of why is it that some people just never will see that and why some do, and also just why we make such horrible, cruel decisions and hurt one another so much?<br><br><br>Well, the reason, very broadly speaking, that we make such cruel decisions and hurt each other so much is because we have so much fear. Where fear is great, ego is great, and our ego is great. All terrible things can happen because in the quest to justify the self, which is grabbing false power, the ego will say, well, I look, you have value now because you believe this or you have value now because you can do this. <br>Maybe you can hurt the person next to you so you feel better for a few seconds because look, I see proof of my own power, so now I feel better or something like that. That's very shallow. It's not true satisfaction. The ego doesn't have true power, but the reason the ego does that is because it's just a portion of us that's trying to fix the problem.<br>The problem is this state where we have not come to terms with yet, the state of feeling separate, alone, not having power. We're in a world where bodies die. We see death. We're afraid of that being the end potentially because we don't remember. So, that's a huge fear-provoking perception because it's not in alignment with the truth as I mentioned. So, to boil it all down very simply, we have a lot of fear, so we hurt each other. Love is then the answer. <br>What love means is accepting each other, supporting each other, having compassion for each other, no matter what, no matter the form, no matter the belief system, no matter the skin color, no matter the sex, no matter the political party, no matter the race, no matter human versus animal. We love, we accept, we support, we act in alignment with the connectedness of our nature.<br>If you think of it this way, we're like all part of one body, the body of the ocean, the source. We're like drops in the ocean. To act in alignment with that truth is love, whereas fear is smaller, back to the self, and screw the rest of the body. I'll just do what I can for myself. Now, here we are, we're like a fear orgy happening for sure. So, that's happening. Does that mean that we're really pretty terrible beings? Well, it's not really that. It's that we have entered a situation, a condition, a context of very extreme constraints, and we have a very long way to go to integrate those constraints, to come to terms with them all. That is, we all have a lot of fear.<br>If you had a very evolved being, called an ascended master in new age terminology, a very evolved being, come to Earth and incarnate as separate, they will not respond with the same fear even in difficult conditions because they have integrated this, and that no longer, there is no need to fear, and they experientially know it, so they're able to express that love and not be overcome by fear, whereas those of us who have a long way to go, I certainly myself included, have a lot of fear. So, we need to face and process that fear. That is a step in the direction of the solution: facing and processing our own fear and trying to bring love in small ways into even our own lives. That is the way forward.<br>We tend to focus on the surface on all the politics and all the systems and all the conditions and all the objects. Where's this object today? Can I move this object over here? Look who's all the money. That's very unimportant relatively speaking compared to our inner experience and how we use the physical experience, whether we're bringing love-based or fear-based intent into our experience. I remember that's fantastic, and I remembered my two questions. <br>That was fantastic because it led me into this. People, I have this discussion all the time because I know a lot of people say, oh, I believe that they're evil souls, and they're not evil souls, and my belief is that no soul is evil. It's not possible, but people say, well, what about Hitler? And my explanation is always, he was a sick, damaged human being with a brain that had problems and a spiritual malady who was somehow, whether it's through indoctrination, mental illness, trauma, people do horrible, horrible things out of fear.<br>So, yeah, but I don't personally believe they're evil at the soul level, which people don't like to hear. But what I also want to interject really, yes, please, the reason so when people don't like to hear that, what part of the self doesn't like to hear that other people aren't evil? Oh, right, it's the ego.<br>Yeah, because it's judgment. I want justice. I want that person to suffer. But the truth is, we are all totally unconditionally loved and healed, and if there's a part of us that does not want unconditional love and healing for another, that's ego. Okay, so but I'll let you continue. I kind of interject. I just think that's, I love that. I guess I'll, okay, one other comment, sorry, please, no, that's why this if it stimulates something great. Yeah, I know. Okay, so Hitler is a good example. I think the Hitler question comes up a lot. Whoever is asking that question, do you not have fear in your own life? Right? If the answer is, okay, and if you do, have you not ever hurt someone else even in a small way, maybe even inadvertently? If you have, is this that it's the same?<br>I know there's a difference in scope, yes, a difference in pain inflicted, a difference in how many life trajectories were burned to the ground through Hitler in Hitler's case. I'm not making light of that scope at all, but fear is fear. <br>Our own, like, there's not a huge difference between those with a lot of experience pressing and less fear expressing in that sense, right? There is a difference in evolution, there is a difference in evolution maybe between one being and another, but I think it's important to not do the ego trick of saying, well, I'm a good person, and they're an evil person. Right? The okay, so I guess I'll just leave it at that. I just think this is an important topic because we thrive on judgment.<br>Perfect, unconditional love transcends and understands all of the judgment. Now, are we, even though we're unconditionally loved, does that mean that there's no reason not to make bad choices? No, absolutely not, because we are 100% accountable for every single thought, every single action, every single intention, every lifting of a finger is a part of us. What I mean is, when you move on and you see your impact, the impact of who you are, you can see very clearly, oh, wow, I have so much imperfection, I have so much fear, and it's a part of you. You are responsible for, you could say, but that whole system, call it karmic responsibility, even that whole system of energetic cause and effect exists within unconditional love.<br>The unconditional love gives rise to a system of experiential growth and evolution for the sake of love, and love is the true power. It can't be any other way. So, that means even Hitler deserves and is even unconditional love, right? Which is so kind. I know that sounds so controversial, but I know exactly what you mean, and that's what's so hard for people here to understand because it's so far out of their paradigm because he's the worst of the worst of evildoers in that we know of. So, one of their small comments, so like, if you're, so I'm a parent, yes, I have two young children. So, one day I was watching my children, I don't remember exactly the circumstance, but I remember my one child doing something slightly hurtful to the other child out of an early learned ego response, and it was mild, but it hurt.<br>Now, do I love my child any less because that child did something to the other child? No, right? No, because I know that they're just befuddled by what the behavior, the conditioning, the learning, the who I am as a human person. <br>Now, if that's true of me as a human parent with extreme limitations and fears myself, what then of the great source that understands all things, knows all things, knows all parts of itself, knows the preciousness of every soul, and is itself endless eons of love? How much more than can that love understand Hitler? Right? Or you? Right? Just yeah, you see what I mean? That's why it's so vastly different from our existence here, and I know exactly what you mean. It's the soul of the person that's always pure. It's not the person.<br>Yeah, and I think that's such an issue. We get twisted. We get twisted for a while in a temporary sense. I'm not saying there's no such thing as twisted individuals, but I'm saying that all of us are twisted to some degree in the sense that we are wrapped into fear over fear. Fear is a pain. Fear is painful for ourselves and for others, and we all do it to varying degrees, and that is a non-native thing. The fear itself is non-native. It only occurs when we're in an experience that is not in alignment with the truth of who we are. It only occurs in the illusion of separation and the illusion of powerlessness.<br>Yeah, but that's one of the amazing things about coming here. Wow, you mean when I'm there, I don't know I have power. When I'm there, I don't know I'm unconditionally loved. When I'm there, I can, what really? Here we are. What will we do with it? Can we shine that true loving nature into this context too, even in a world where people can be killed, and or Hitler's can kill millions of people? Can we bring love in even a small way? When it's over, the play is over. It's okay. Nothing truly was damaged. Nothing truly was lost. It was a valuable experience. It was like going to the movies or something. You know, wow, that was an intense movie. That was a really intense movie.<br>Yeah, and it's so real here that it's hard to imagine when you're in that other dimension that it is just sort of an illusion here. It's the worst thing in the world, and so because it's our world, this is our little, you know, this is our world. Yeah, and on that note, I wanted to sort of end by addressing what you said earlier that we're waking up because I've heard this a lot, and I don't know if I could have done this podcast 20 years ago and gotten the support that I've gotten or said, hey, I'm a medium, and had people, there are people that are like, okay, that's interesting, and they don't believe in it, and that's fine, but people now know what a medium is. <br>People now know what spirituality is sort of all about, and there are so many people like us talking about this stuff now that it just seems so timely, COVID, the whole presidential election, Afghanistan, all of these big things are happening at a time when we're also waking up. We're suffering as a species, but we're also spiritually evolving. Can you speak to that?<br><br><br>So, part of what I'll just, there's one thing that comes to mind that's of course because the real comment to that involves everything that's happening, but just one thing I'll say is, as we evolve as a collective, it means that all the old fear-based thought patterns that we have entertained so deeply need to come back up to be faced and processed and integrated and healed. <br>We don't heal by burying it away and never looking at it again. Healing takes place with open eyes, true knowing, and so as we do that as individuals, think of us as individuals as a part of like the pond of the collective consciousness or something, as we each engage fear and as we each wake up, we're slowly changing the temperature of the water.<br>Yeah, and as the temperature of the water increases, it provokes that which is not in alignment with it. Like, put it this way, the temperature of the water tends to draw us all towards the mean of the temperature. So, like, this reminds me of a comment I once worked with the near-death experiencer Christian Andres, and he's a beautiful man, and I had this really high experience that I just, I was so connected, I knew, but I had mentioned him, but I felt like I was being drawn back down. <br>He said, well, that's the mean vibration of this place. That's the average vibration of course. You can't, you're a part of it, so you're kind of bound vibrationally. So, just we're not actually bound, okay? We're never actually truly bound, but for the purposes of this conversation, it's like being bound into that pond.<br>So, as the vibration increases and awareness increases, all the ugly, and there's a lot of it, holy cow, our human history has got all sorts of nastiness in it, so much hatred, so much violence, so much prejudice. So, as we raise that, that stuff has to come up to be processed and faced and healed, both individually and as a collective, and I feel like some of the political environment in the United States lately is kind of an example of that. That's just my own personal feeling. <br>Yeah, but that's okay. That's a good process. It may appear on the surface that there is more friction. There will be more friction when you drive that change, when you drive the processing of such deep, deep conditioning. I mean, we live in a world where for thousands of years, as an example, we have killed and eaten the bodies of other creatures. I mean, just think about that. That's the nature of this world that we're in. It's pretty horrific.<br>Yeah, so we have that like we have a deeply ingrained level of fear-based thought patterns, and so as the consciousness increases, we must process those, and so the friction on the surface, don't become overwhelmed by it or discouraged. So, I'm energetically sensitive, and I can feel the vibration of groups, and when I go into public spaces lately, I feel a higher vibration than five or ten years ago, slightly. You know, it's noticeable even though on the surface there might be a lot of controversy, and I think that's kind of indicative of what's happening across the board. <br>We actually are growing. It's just that the play might get pretty hectic, and it might remain hectic for a while. I mean, we could even have great periods of local destruction, but again, this is just the props in the play. What matters is what we do with it, what's in us, and each individual can do that. We're all a part of the solution. It's not a situation of hopelessness at all.<br>Each individual only needs to face and meet their own experience with open eyes, open heart, face your own fear, bring love in your own life, smile to the person next to you, tell someone they're awesome, accept someone next time they trigger your ego, just do that, and we will be helping the temperature of the water increase. That's great. I love that. That's a great place for us to end because I did want to ask what can we do to help raise that overall collective vibration, and I do want to know, do you think that there's ever going to be a time in our existence as human beings where it's possible to have total peace, where so many people will be quote-unquote awakened that it's possible?<br>I do think so. I do think it's likely actually, not may perhaps not certain, but very likely in the long run. That's a nice thought to hold on to. Thank you so much for being here, Christian, and for sharing your many insights. I'm really looking forward to reading your book, and I'm going to have a link below about where people can find the book. Tell us what else, anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up. Yeah, first of all, I just want to share that the book is free. I'm not, it's not about money. If you go to my website, a walk in the physical dot com, and go to the book page, the third link down is a link to the Google Books PDF of the book, so it's there for everybody.<br><br><br>That's wonderful. Yeah, I mean, I think the most important thing we can wrap up with is, I say this every time, but sometimes we need to hear a message many times for it to really sink in. Whoever you are listening today, you're not human. You're you. You are the experiencer who's knowing being human, and your true nature is love and joy and peace and freedom. That is what you are. Fear does not, you don't need to fear. You don't need to worry about the things that you fear, and you don't need to take the story of your life so seriously. We can use this play, we can use this experience however we like. We can use it in joy and in fun. <br>So, go do something fun today. Some joy. It's okay to do that, and I just think that reminder in the context of what we really are, you know, there's a lot of power in that. The truth in what we are is very good and powerful, and so if we can feel that even a little bit, I really think that can go a long way.<br>What a way to start the day. It's morning, and I just really appreciate that so much, and I know everyone else will too. Thank you so much for continuing to spread the word that we are not human, that we are pure love and light, and I love the message of just encouraging people to embody that light and walk away from fear. It's not easy, but it is possible, and I love that optimistic perspective that there is hope for us as humanity to heal these wounds and continue to do better. <br>One, I'll just say when I think to that last comment, I recently had a conversation with a gentleman for a different video, and he said, the house always wins, and I loved that so much. It means that the house is spirit, God, whatever term you want to use, goodness always wins in the end. Put it that way. Every experience is used for the refinement of love and joy ultimately because love enjoys what we are.<br>So, I'm agreeing with what your statement is, and I just want to say that it is not only possible, it is the natural direction. Evolution towards love and joy is the natural direction. Beautiful. Thanks again, Christian. I'm so appreciative of your sharing your insight and your unique light with us as well. Thank you. Thank you very much. Have a good day. You too.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2021/let&apos;s-talk-about-pre-birth-experiences-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2021/LET&apos;S TALK ABOUT PRE-BIRTH EXPERIENCES WITH CHRISTIAN SUNDBERG.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:02:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Life Between Lives Experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=GBuV4pnSwVY<br>16 NOV 2021<br><br><br>Beautiful, we're live. Christian, welcome to the podcast. Thank you very much, guys. Great to be here.<br>I am, like I was just speaking to you off-air as well. I stumbled across your work a few months ago, and I was absolutely fascinated—absolutely fascinated. It's not many conversations I think I can have like what we're about to have today, with your journey, your experiences. So, I just want to know—I'll let you know—I really appreciate you coming on the show today. And I always love to ask my guests this very first question every show because it always strikes an interesting conversation anyway, and that is: If you were at an intimate dinner party right now with a bunch of strangers, and the person next to you said, "What do you do for a living?" what would you say?<br>Well, the typical human answer is to respond with a career choice. I'm currently in between jobs, but typically, if they're interested, I'd like to dig a little deeper and ask what they mean by it. And I like to qualify that who I am is not specifically just what I do for a living. So, for 19 years, I worked in the nuclear power industry. I spent 14 years managing complex nuclear valve and pump manufacturing projects. But I know that's not what we are. I'm not completely distracted by that. So, if it's a setting like that, I'd probably like to draw attention to what both that person and I really are and the meaning we can have—yes, experience at the table.<br>Yeah, and what if—how have you found your response to these conversations? Are people open, or is it really a place to gauge where people are at? First, they'll either run a mile or just go, "Tell me more, that's fascinating."<br><br><br>Yeah, people really have been very open. And I know how what I share sounds. I'm not unaware of the non-stereotypical, non-mainstream nature of the message that I've shared. I know how it appears on the surface. In fact, I didn't even share my pre-birth experience for seven or eight years after it returned to me because it just didn't seem appropriate to do so. But the other response has absolutely been amazing. I've met so many absolutely amazing people—so many deeply spiritual and aware people. <br>I've probably met 30 or 40 other pre-birth experiencers by now—other people who remember choosing their lives and coming to Earth. So, I'm definitely not the only one. It's really very cool when we can validate portions of that experience with each other here. You know, I feel like it's such a cool thing to come all the way here, be human, and then touch base here on Earth about these things. That's quite a unique, quite a unique thing.<br>Incredible. And how would you define then a pre-birth experience?<br>Well, linear time is tricky because linear time is a construct. We actually transcend the linear time that we seem to be so bound to. So, when I say pre-birth, of course, it does occur before human birth, but it also, for me, feels like it's happening right now and also feels like it's ridiculously ancient. I don't know how to describe it, but it is an experience that occurs prior to the process of incarnating, of accepting the veil, and coming in to have a physical experience. And to me, it seems very normal, very natural. When this experience returned to me, it was the most normal, natural thing in the world. It was like someone had just told me that I had coffee waiting for me on a dinner table or something.<br>It was just totally normal, nothing unique about it, though I understand that it is unique on Earth not to remember. But yeah, we all go through a process of coming—there's an intention behind our lives—and that process of life selection and accepting the veil and coming to be physical. I'm just referring to that generally as a pre-birth experience. It's a very deep and personal experience at the much deeper levels of the self that precedes the human experience of a given life.<br><br><br>Yeah, well, it's amazing, Christian. Like, I get it because I think even just going back three or four years ago, I'd have been challenged to have this conversation because a part of me would still not go, "Really, like, come on." But at the same time, I've done plant-based medicines. I've done ayahuasca journeys, which led me into just getting pulled into meditation. I had no desired outcome from it, but I just got pulled in like, "Why am I so curious about this? I just got to scratch that itch, you know?" Yeah, yeah. So, it then led me to have these expansive experiences that were beyond myself and beyond linear time. But once I had that experience, I go, "Huh, it actually feels like coming home, but it's kind of familiar, but it's not, you know?" Yeah, so then, as you know, it's continued to open up since. <br>Hence, why I invited you on because I kind of had enough threads of experiences to go, "Wow, there's definitely more than I actually consciously know in my conscious mind, you know?" So, I definitely get where you're coming from. I'm curious in your life because I'd love to touch on some of your experiences from the pre-birth memories. But what was it like because you know, when you talk about it, you kind of had these memories as a child, but then, like all of us as children, we tend to forget our memories, and then we become adults, and we kind of suppress them. But they started bubbling up for you again. Was there a particular trigger or an incident that actually set that off in your life because I believe you said you were 30 years old?<br>Yes, my body is 41 years old right now, and when I was 30, I took up a long-term meditation practice, just like you're saying. I had no expectation at all. It's just that I meditated several times, and it felt wonderful. That was initially what compelled me to keep doing it. I found some peace, you know, that I was always stressed and anxious. At first, it was just that, "Wow, there's actually peace and just being able to focus on just one thing." Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer who I'm a great fan of, recommends meditation as a form of investigation—in other words, just go see, go look, go find out what is your awareness, your consciousness itself, when it's not associated with all the thoughts. <br>So, it doesn't need to have any meaning attached to it at all. You just go look. So, I did that, and after a few months, I had a non-physical experience similar to what you described. I don't know if mine would technically be called a Kundalini awakening, but I had a very strong energetic vibrational experience that shocked me. And I continued to meditate after that, and then the memories were just there. It wasn't like a big ta-dah, it wasn't a big revelation. It was just that they had always been there.<br>It's just that they had been covered up, like I don't know, like the ground covered by leaves or something, and the leaves just got blown away, and there it is. And it's so normal. Wow. And I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I remember that. I remember knowing that when I was a god. How did I forget that?" You know, it just seemed strange to me that I'd forgotten. It still seems strange to me, you know, yeah, we've forgotten. But yeah, it's just it was just there.<br>And how vivid were the memories that started to come through?<br><br><br>So, at first, it was segments that are ridiculously vivid. They're not like earthly memories. They are being-level, you know. They're like—this is all so impossible to describe. I just have to claim this before we get into all this, and I say this every time I have a conversation with somebody because we really have to be careful not to take the meaning of our earthly language and think that that can describe this stuff. It just can't. Language, words are form. You know, they are symbols, elements of our local experience, and our true nature transcends this experience entirely. It transcends linear time, physical distance, all the things that our language is. <br>Our language is based in a world of spectrums, and we transcend those spectrums. So, I just have to say that as a disclaimer very quickly because any time I feel like any time we even put out any words on it, it's just wrong immediately because of the expansive and unlimited nature of these things.<br>Okay, but that being said, the memories are very being-level memories. They are like living experiences now that are deeply a part of me and are connected to a great deal of feeling and imagery and knowledge. That's the only way I can describe it. It's not like one like earthly memory is very specific and dull by comparison, very limited. And sometimes I'm closer to it, and sometimes I'm further away. You know, if I haven't meditated in a while and I've been focusing on work all day every day, you know, it feels more distant. <br>But if I'm clear and focused and not associated as deeply with thinking and with my earthly identity and I'm just fully alert, it can be extremely tangible too. But that's the nature of the veil. You know, we kind of oscillate. The more we focus on our story here and on our thoughts and on our conditioning and on our labels of the story, the more deeply we wrap ourselves in that, the deeper the veil is felt. And you know, we can feel more distant from our true nature, especially when we buy into perceptions that are not in alignment with the truth of who we are—like if we buy into perceptions of powerlessness or unworthiness of love or lack of freedom. <br>Those are all converse to the truth. The truth is we are worthy of love and powerful and free beings. And I just mentioned that because here on Earth, you know, we get tied up in these perceptions of those negative self-perceptions, and that associating with that, losing ourselves in those perceptions, it deepens the feeling of the veil in our distance from that side. So, when we can let go and just be fully present and fully feel the aliveness that we are, you know, that deeper stuff can just rise up all on its own once again.<br>Yeah, yeah, incredible. I gotta ask you this because you've probably shared it a thousand times, and I do apologize, but I know a lot of the listeners will be new to listening to you today, and it's like, "Well, what memories did you have? What were you starting to experience with these meditations? What was coming through?" Because I think, for me, it's like it's the greatest mystery of all, isn't it? It's like, you know, and when you have people like yourself that talk about these things, it's needed, I believe. So, we all know—I don't consider myself special at all in that regard. We all know deep down. We none of us need an external person. I just want that to be said up front because we've all gone through amazingly rich, deep journeys, even if we are deep in the human personality for a while. That's okay. That's what we're here on Earth to do. Okay, but I'll share.<br><br><br>Okay, so the first memory that I have in this experience is long, long ago before I had ever been physical at all, coming across a being who had been physical. And I was so deeply inspired by the quality of this being's nature or essence—the quality of what he was. It just had this depth and beauty and power to it and so much joy and so much love and so much capacity and so much just power and quality. I don't know how to describe it. It was so rich. And I asked him—and again, these aren't words, it's telepathic. There's just an exchange of information on that side, a very complete and full exchange—like, "My goodness, like, what did you do to become this? Look at what you've become. What could you possibly have done to do this? And are you filled with as much joy as I feel that you're filled with?" <br>And he shared with me. Yes, he shared a lot with me. And among what he shared with me was that he had lived physical lives, and there was one physical life in particular where he had been—he had suffered. He had been either wounded or had some kind of disease, but he had a pain with him that lasted for many years, and it was very, very difficult for him to tolerate. But the way that he chose to meet that experience was very powerful, and through that experience, it permitted a very deep and beautiful refinement of his being. <br>That's the best way I can describe it. And I was just so inspired. I said, "I want to do that. I'm going to do that. I am going to do that." And he said—the words are so lacking here, but it was kind of like, "Yeah, that's what they all say," like, you know, kind of not brushing me off but almost like in a playful way. Like, it communicated, "It's difficult in a way that you just don't understand. You just have no knowledge of how difficult this can be." And I persisted, and I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do it." And he said, "Well, then go talk to your guides." So, I did. And I don't recall right after that, but I do remember living many times and then coming and finding this being later and engaging him and kind of sharing with him that I was on this path, and he was encouraging.<br><br><br>Okay, so then the majority of this pre-life memory is of a time somewhat immediately preceding this physical life. I remember taking a very long break after a previous physical experience, and this guide coming to me repeatedly and asking me, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And just putting them off for a while, like over and over, like, "No, I'm not ready yet. No, I'm not ready." I'm just like putting them off many times because I was just not ready to go back and do that yet. And finally, I said, "Okay, I'm ready." <br>And I remember reviewing what I can only describe as like a chart or like a review of my state—like who I was, who I had been, the qualities that I knew that I really understood and engendered maybe. And it was a rich review of like—this is so hard to describe, but like all of what I am. And it was clear in that the thing that I needed to work on—I don't really like the words "work on." It's more like the area that would be best for me to experience and evolve through something like that. <br>And it was just blatantly obvious. Like, it was like if you looked at—I don't know, this is just crude human language—but imagine if you looked at like a chart with a hundred lines on it, and there's one that's just like super down, you know, like way, super obvious to see. It's like, "Oh, yeah, I got to do something about that." Like, there was no ambiguity. <br>And so, I said, "Okay." And okay, so what this thing was was a fear. It was a very low vibration energy, a fear energy that I had experienced in previous lives, and it had bested me. There was one life in particular in which this fear had gotten out of hand, and it had overcome me, and I became very egoic, and I hurt many other people in that life. And I had no—like, I couldn't believe that I had that much fear. But I knew that the fear was such a low vibration and so extreme that I knew even from that perspective, just very objectively, like, "Wow, this is a major undertaking." <br>And so, I asked, "Is it even possible to integrate this level of fear? Is it even possible to meet this level of experience? Has it ever been done in all of creation ever?" And I remember the guide sharing with me, "Yes, it has, and you have all time available to you to do so. You don't have to do it right away. There's no hurry." <br>And I just knew if it can be done, I will do it. And you know, it seems so strange to me now as like the human personality because I've met with great challenges in my life. You know, sometimes I suffer very deeply, but at the time, I just knew my strength. You know, I knew what I could do, and I was very purposeful in that. I said, "If it can be done, I will do it." So, they brought me a life that was very, very appropriate for this intention, and I reviewed that life, and I accepted that life, and then I accepted the veil for that life.<br><br><br>Now, the veil is just a word. I mean, it's—these things are very hard to describe, but it is—I'll just describe it because this is the thing that I remember most clearly, and it's kind of in the forefront of my mind every day because like it's almost like I can feel this now. But I felt this incredible drop in vibration of going from a place of all connectedness and all-knowing and all freedom down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. And it was like if somebody took an amplifier that was producing a pitch, and then you turn down the knob, and then you turn it down some more, more and more, and then lower and then lower and more, and then you think you're done, then you turn it down some more. You know, like that's how it felt—just such an incredible, ridiculously low plummet down, down, down into the state of being physical. And when I arrived, it felt like a place of darkness and separation. <br>I felt like I had lost all that I am, and I immediately responded in fear. I immediately rejected it. I said, "I am not doing this. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I am not going to tolerate this. This is not happening." So, I mustered my might, my strength, and I fought my way out. I smote the veil, and I was successful in doing so because I was then on the other side again, and I had a life review because I had killed the fetus that was to be my body inadvertently by rejecting, by pushing myself back out. And I became aware of how my fear had impacted the mother and not only the mother but hundreds of other people whose journeys would have been made more difficult because of my fear. You know, and I had all these great intentions. Like, I really had this great intention, but I could see, "Oh, my gosh, all I did was heap difficulty. I got to do something about this." I could just see very clearly. It was like, "You know, man, I can't believe I did that." I mean, but you know, it's okay because on the other side, you know, all is well. There is no true problem. It's just a play. Everything's fine. <br>Everyone's okay. But I just could see like, "Oh, man, I had so much respect and love for the other players in the game, and I couldn't believe that I had heaped more difficulty on them rather than helping." You know, like, I just wanted to be up. I wanted to have a positive effect, and I didn't. And so, I knew, "Oh, man, I really got to do something about this fear." So, I spent some time practicing accepting the veil in a room—a place that I can only describe as like a veil acceptance simulator. <br>And I know that sounds strange, but I remember being in this place. It seemed like going to a room with a dark pool where you get dunked underneath the water and see how long you can hold your breath, and if you want, you can cry uncle, and they'll let you out because it's just a simulator, right? It was like that. And I practiced that for a while, but I can tell you the real veil is much more difficult than the simulator. I'll tell you that right now because okay.<br>Okay, so then they brought me this current life as Christian, and I reviewed this life, and I knew that this life was good, but it was not as perfectly appropriate as the first one would have been. That one was a way more appropriate, perfect match for my intention. This one wasn't bad, but it was good. It was okay. And I remember reviewing this life. Okay, so it was like if you—it was like I reviewed a flowchart is the only way I can describe it of millions and millions of possibilities of what this life could be or would be like. It was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side and you started at the trunk and went out to the branches, it was kind of like that except it was what it would feel like to be me, to be Christian at these various ages. <br>And it was probabilistic, you know, like there were certain avenues that were very likely, almost certain, and others that were less likely. But it was very complex—millions and millions of paths that I reviewed all within a second. It was not hard for me to do, so I could review it all at once. And I remember asking certain questions about the life, making certain requests. Like, for instance, I knew that it was important that I be male because I knew that in this case, having a male energy would help me to face the fear in a certain way—not that it has anything to do with women being unable to face fear and nothing like that at all. It's simply that there are different qualities to the energy of male and female, and something about having an obtuse edge would be helpful by being male. I also asked if I could be intelligent again in this life because I knew that I had been intelligent in previous experiences, and it was a trait that I preferred, and they said yes, I could do that. <br>And I knew that my parents were important and that they would raise me in a way that would enable me to have the ability to meet this fear. Like, my father would instill confidence in me, and that would give me a rock to stand on, you know, to be able to face this fear. And so, I reviewed it all, and I was super excited, and I knew that chief among what would happen is that I would—okay, so I knew that this body has limitations that other bodies don't, and that it would make the day-to-day experience more difficult actually. And I knew that that difficulty actually was just yet another opportunity for growth because that contrast, like all contrast, is actually an opportunity. <br>And I knew that I would very likely experience a trauma in my early 20s that would crush me and give me a chance, an opportunity to re-experience this fear. And that did happen—just to jump to that part of the story—when I was 22, I had a heat stroke in Chengdu, China, and I was in a Chinese hospital for four days, and I received a lot of potassium—bag after bag after bag of potassium. And I don't know if it was that potassium that did this or something else. I had celiac disease also at the time, so I had autoimmune flare-ups occurring, but what was important is that I experienced a neurological burning, a neurological pain that lasted for weeks and months, and it was again just agony, and I couldn't escape it. <br>And this fear that I'm here to face is a vibration of—oh, it's very hard to explain or describe, but it's something like being unable to escape pain mixed with being too proud to suffer. And so, that was the energy of this event when I was 22. So, I had post-traumatic stress for a few years—I'm jumping ahead now—but I had post-traumatic stress for a few years after this trauma, and I processed a huge amount of that through EMDR therapy with a therapist, and I met and faced and integrated a lot of this fear. And it was only after I did that that this memory was able to return. I certainly didn't have any awareness of this at the time, but now it's helpful because now I know what I'm doing. So, when an experience like that arises for me, I know I don't have to fear. I can just face and feel.<br>But anyway, so back to the story—I hate calling it a story—back to this preparation experience. I remember there being a moment to say yes, and I don't remember that moment, but I do remember then being in this waiting area where I was like—I can only describe it like a waiting room that was high vibration, and all of a sudden, this guide coming to me and getting my attention like, "Go now," like grabbing my attention now, right now, like just kind of grabbing me by the shoulders like, "Right now, don't wait. You gotta go right now. You're on Earth time, kind of thing." <br>And the next thing I remember is being in this place that I can only describe as like a mechanics room or a mechanic shop. It was a room that had like a big pit in the middle of it is how I saw it, but there were these beings there that I can only describe as tinkerers or technicians, and they did this thing for me where they applied the veil to me. Like, they made the veil appropriate for me because this—it's like the soul has certain rich, complex energetic qualities, and the life and the body and the context have something going on, and they do this thing where they make it all fit. They make it organic and personal. And so, I remember being in this room over this pit, and them asking me one last time, "Are you sure? Are you sure you want to do this because once you say yes here, this is it. You're strapped in. You're in for the ride."<br>And I remember saying yes, and then the veil coming over me again, and my vibration plummeting down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, and all my knowing being cut off, and all of my connectedness disappearing, and everything that I was feeling like it was vanishing. And I remember coming all the way down into this dense bodily experience and then basically just trying not to fight it this time because I didn't want to repeat what I had done previously where I rejected it. I didn't want to repeat that, so I focused on simply surrendering and allowing the veil to have power over me.<br>Okay, so then I was here, and I sent one little message back to the technicians, "Did it take? Like, you know, did the veil take?" And getting one message back, "Yes." And so, I knew that I had made it, and I was very excited that I had made it. Okay, so then I was here for a while, and then after a while, I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this. This is not happening.<br>This is so dark. This is such low vibration. What? I cannot believe the low vibration of the state." So, once again, I began to muster my might to fight my way out, and as I did that, the most holy moment in my human journey happened. The great spirit of what I can only describe as God—the I AM presence of the universe—came to me, and it said to me in a way that was so deep and personal and in the depths of my being—I can't even describe it. It's not even words. It showed me what I really was. It showed me the universe. It showed me all of creation, and I felt the bliss of being that I was. I felt the churning of our sun and how as it churned, it was just full of this raging bliss of joy. And I felt all of that in me, and the voice said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." <br>And that memory is the most precious and holy moment for me because that is what we all are. You know, that is our true nature—that unlimited, perfectly connected, free, joyful, powerful, so powerful spirit that we are. And in this case, that reminded me enough that I survived. Like, "Oh, I surrendered. I was like, 'Oh, that's what I am. That's wonderful. Okay.'"<br>And so, I let go into the simple existence of being in the womb, and the next memory I have is of the day I was born. I remember the shock of being born—the sense data, just lots of sight, sound, touching, cold. I remember being super confused and curious but having no intellectual understanding at all of what was going on. I remember looking at the beings that were there in the room taking care of me and feeling love for them—like the nurses—and just feeling like, "Oh, my gosh, who are these beings that are taking care of me? What is going on?" Like, just being so intensely curious. And that seems like so long ago to me now. You know, it seems like thousands of years ago that I experienced that, even though I'm only 41 years old.<br><br><br>So, then as I aged, I just say that I remember having portions of this memory, especially the flowchart memory, and I remember being a young child and like cheating a little bit and peeking in just to see what was going to happen—like, "Well, what's going to happen tomorrow?" Just on real simple things like, "Where are we going to go? Or who's going to come over?" And just trying to peek just because I was curious and I wanted to know. <br>But that ability diminished and left me as I got older, especially by the ages of five or six, I would say. So, that's a brief summary. Again, these things are very, very difficult to describe. I feel like every time I share the experience, I know I'm repeating many of the same words. I don't know how else to say it, and it's just too big for language.<br>Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you for sharing that. There's about 10 different directions I could have gone in from what you've just said. Sorry. That's okay. No, that's okay. The first question I guess to bring it into the physical aspect of us is: What did you do when you started remembering? What do you do with an experience like that because you still have to get up, pay the bills, go to work, and actually process that kind of information? And you know, did you find yourself feeling free all of a sudden, or did you find yourself feeling terrified, thinking, "Is anyone going to think I've lost the plot?" Like, where were you at?<br>Well, like I said, I didn't share it at first. It was definitely a closet-keeping experience for seven or eight years because that's not something I mean—I was a working professional most of my life, and that's the kind of thing you don't really share if you're a working professional. No, but it did feel very freeing—very freeing. And it was also very like—I just wanted, okay, so as I—and it wasn't just the memories. It was that more importantly, I was having experiences. Like, everybody, I think, is very interested in hearing that story, but I don't actually think it's very important. <br>I think what's much more important is to focus on what we're doing here and to help remind each other of what we really are and of the love and the joy of our true nature and remind each other of how important it is to face our own fear and ego and to overcome it, you know, and to heal and to bring joy into the world. I mean, that's what's important to me. So, really, what my focus initially was—I mean, it was on—I was discovering things. I was having out-of-body experiences, and I was like, "Oh, my gosh, people need to know about this." <br>So, my initial instinct was like, "I just need to tell people somehow." And I remember having this very silly idea actually—this sounds so ridiculous to me now that I think about it—but I actually said out loud to my wife, "I at least considered this for five minutes." I said, "Maybe I should create flyers and put them in people's mailboxes and tell them that they're non-physical beings just having a human experience." And my wife is like, "You're gonna be that guy if you do that." And I'm like, "Yeah, I am going to be that guy. What am I thinking? I can't do that. That's crazy." You know, so I just kept my mouth shut, but I began to write. I felt spirit come to me over the years and basically like, "Oh, help me to bring language to my own awakening process as I went through it." And so, I wrote a blog, and the blog I knew from the beginning would eventually become a book. <br>And the book is now out. It's available for free on my website—awalkinthephysical.com. I'm just mentioning that in case it's helpful to somebody. It's not about the money. So, I wrote these blog posts knowing that they were part of a bigger framework, and I put them into a larger framework to try to speak to what are we doing here? You know, what is this human experience in the physical? You know, what is going on within the bigger context? And it's very difficult to put that into language, and it's very difficult to speak to the nature of consciousness in language because it transcends all form, all language. But I felt very much motivated to do that, and so now that the book is out, I feel deeply happy that it is. I feel that it's my life's work actually. Now that it's out, I feel like if I were to pass tomorrow, I would be happy. And I feel like I can actually kind of walk away, take a step away from it now if I need to. That's fine. It's off on its own. I just needed to make it available.<br><br><br>See, that was my initial reaction, but yeah, it's very shocking and eye-opening when you have these kinds of experiences. They're not subtle. It's like you can't help but look at life differently. My old belief systems were deeply challenged. You know, I was raised with a certain belief system that I had to drastically—maybe "modify" is not the right word—you know, tear down and reestablish because it just wasn't as accurate as it could be. And I took a lot of humility actually and courage for me to do that and to admit all that I didn't know. So, yeah, that was a big change, big process.<br>Yeah, wow. You mentioned fear many times sharing your story and looking to work on these challenges and overcoming. Yeah, how would you distill—because obviously there's a lot of fear going on right now in the world, right? Like, there's—you know, I've certainly been gripped by fear in the past that can stop me from moving forward into different aspects of my life. What have you learned about fear? What is the purpose of fear, and how do we then work with fear?<br>Yeah, well, it's not so—it's not that fear is a substance that we have to work with. It's simply that—okay, so the truth of what we are is love and joy and excitement and creativity and freedom. That is the nature of consciousness itself. Its native nature is love. Fear is an artifact that we experience when we lose ourselves in a place where we are not the whole anymore. So, when we don't know the totality of what we are and we buy into perceptions like I mentioned before that are not in alignment with the truth, that provokes fear. But that's because now there's a big problem. <br>You know, now that we feel separate, we feel like we don't have our power, we don't have access to our own knowledge. I mean, gosh, look at what's possible in this world. We naturally respond in fear, and then the ego is the part of us that rises up and tries to fix the problem and help somehow by buying into beliefs or self-justifications or all the stories—whatever stories I can to avoid facing my fear because, man, I don't want to face that fear. The fear can be very, very deep and dark. But I like to call fear simply yet unevolvingness. It's not a substance that has true power or something. It's just that it's a signpost to us that we have an area that we have not yet fully integrated—an experience, a condition, or a context that we have not yet fully integrated.<br><br><br>I'll use a simple example that I mentioned in the book because I think it's simple and crude, but I think it kind of helps. So, when my father was a boy, a young child, he was terrified of his closet in his room. And he laid in his bed every night and just laid there terrified of what was in the closet. He imagined all these monsters and scary things in the closet, and he couldn't sleep. And after dealing with this for dozens of times—maybe months—one night, he said, "Screw this. Whatever's in that closet can't be worse than me laying here being scared of it." <br>So, he jumped out of bed, went into the closet, and sat on the ground in the back of his closet, and he was totally terrified. And he waited for the monsters to eat him, and nothing happened. No monsters ate him, and he then saw there was nothing to fear. There was nothing in the closet. There were no monsters. So, now, as you can rightly guess, my father is no longer afraid of closets as an adult. He can lay in bed and look at a closet in the dark and feel no fear. So, I know that's a simple example, but all the rich contexts of our life that seem so daunting are not that dissimilar. <br>They may be different in scope or intensity, but they are similar in that underneath it all, there is nothing to fear. The love and the joy of what we are is the root of all of our experience. And so, as we integrate the experiences that we have rejected in the past, as we allow or process them and allow ourselves to fully come to terms with them and feel everything that arises out of them and really process it, after the monster in the closet has its way with us, it will go, and what's left is the joy of our being—the love and joy that we always were, but now it can rise up and shine more fully because it's not hindered by this illusion of fear any longer.<br><br><br>Now, I'm not making light of fear. I mean, I've dealt with huge amounts of fear in my life. That's what I'm here to do. I mean, I'm pushing the boundaries in a certain direction and in a certain way, so I'm not making light of how deep and powerful fear can feel. Yeah, I just want to draw attention to the fact that it is not like some opposite that we have to strive against. No, it is only an opportunity. It shows us there's something about our experience that we haven't yet fully come to terms with, and it invites us actually to go integrate that—go see, go into the closet, process it, see what you really are because after we do that, there is a profound expansion of what we are—an expansion of being, an expansion of love and joy.<br>Well, how would you summarize then our purpose of being here in relation to what you just said as well because obviously that's a clear part of us being here? And also, that there is a veil and almost like a disconnection from source. It's not—yeah, we're not actually disconnected from source. We feel this—no, but it feels that way. It's an apparent separation. <br>Oh, yeah, actually, it's an extremely separate feeling. This is the most—if you take us, if you make a spectrum, you know, we're like super far out on the spectrum right now with how separate we feel, and that's unusual. But anyway, so to your question—so, okay, the purpose—if we had to summarize it at a very high level, but I feel the best way to put it is the purpose of this physical universe is to participate in the expansion of love and joy, which is the process of evolution through choice-making in this rich context. So, we have this rich context of duality, and we get to make choices every day, wield intent. <br>We get to use intention, and the intent is the most important thing. The choices happen from intent. You know, it feels like our choice is what we're intending, like, you know, but really, intent—what I mean is the real why—the real deepest why we're making the choices we're making. <br>That's what I'm talking about. We get to then experience exactly what it's like to have to live life with that deepest why. How does life respond to us? How do the people around us respond to us? How does our biology respond to us? Out of society, you know, whatever. How do our own thoughts arise? What thoughts arise? So, it's such a rich context. You know, what beliefs do we buy into? <br>And then how do we experience the reality based on those beliefs? You know, the physical universe is like a giant mirror—a giant mirror that allows us to see exactly what we believe and what we intend. You know, and so, we're having a very true experience to who we really are when we're this constrained. You know, and this is a super, super, super constraining experience. I can't stress that enough. It's not that we're—yes, we have a lot of fear. <br>We have a long way to go. It's not that we are not powerful beings. It's that we've signed up for a very, very challenging game of being human, and the richness of this context in this contrast permits a very precious and valuable expansion of being—an expansion of love and joy. So, we're here to actualize love and grow towards love. That's the simplest way to put it.<br>Yeah, why then do you feel or think that people like yourself have had these experiences, these memories, and had the opportunity to have these realizations of who we truly are, and other people haven't got there yet?<br><br><br>Okay, well, so first of all, I'm not special at all. It's just that—okay, so first of all, we are totally permitted to do whatever we'd like with this playground. There's no real rule that says you can't remember. It's just that there's a ridiculous vibrational distance between there and here, and so the veil is actually very additive because it allows the development of an independent portion of the self—an independent personality that can grow on its own without past memory influence. <br>But it's still the same I that's operating through that character, and that's very helpful. Now, I'm still very much veiled. I'm very thankful that I am. I mean, it sounds like I shared a lot, but to me, it's just the tiniest, tiniest, tiniest little tip of the iceberg, and I'm super veiled, and I'm thankful that I am. Veiling is very much necessary in a way because—well, there's a few reasons. One of which is it protects us from homesickness because we would be so homesick if we remembered the totality of what we are and where we come from that we wouldn't be able to focus here. <br>And it also helps us to focus in a very practical way. You know, because if you had full conscious access to the rest of your being into other reality systems, you wouldn't very well be able to get up and go to work, you know, put gas in the car, that kind of thing. And it also allows us to be deeply—this is important—the veil allows us to be deeply this human character. Like, our Earth is where you can come if you want to come and be the human—like, all the way, man. Then this is how we do it. <br>We require this deep of a veil to allow us to be completely like if you want to have the perspective of being the human, this is what you got to do. You know, you got to be the human all the way, and then later, of course, you will remember all of the rest of what you are as well. But wow, what an experience to be able to operate from such a deeply convincing human vantage point. That's a powerful opportunity.<br>Yeah, for sure. It makes me consider as well in this work that it can be very easy to be chasing getting beyond the veil and then using that to avoid the very things.<br>Yeah, absolutely. You know, it's funny you say that because when I first started having these experiences, I definitely felt that like, "Oh, my gosh, all I want to do now is go out of body." Yeah, that's not what we're here to do. So, I have felt very intuitively guided back to the physical and actually, I've practiced at certain times less meditation because I feel it's helpful to get deeper into the human character—like, to lose myself again actually into the story of Christian, which isn't really who I am, but to lose myself in the story can be helpful because there's opportunity. <br>There's so much opportunity here. Like, we come here for a purpose. So, it's so precious to be able to use this human experience in front of us right now while it's here. It's not a big mistake. It's a huge opportunity. In fact, being human is like such a precious gift. It's so precious. It's such a valuable, sought-after opportunity. So, here you are, you know, here you are today. We get to use this day however we wish. That's an incredible opportunity.<br><br><br>Yeah, the opportunity is here with how we meet our lives right now in the small things—the simplest things. You know, this—it doesn't have to be a huge, complex endeavor. Like, just how do you respond to the person next to you today? How do you brush your teeth? What's your relationship with your pet? Whatever, you know, whatever small way that is, that's the powerful stuff. As humans, we tend to get really lost in the human content drama. <br>We think a lot about how the props on the stage are arranged today. You know, we get really upset about how the props are arranged, but we don't need to worry about that. What we need to do is simply meet our own experience the very best we can, bring love into our own lives, into our own experience, in whatever small way we can, meet our own fear. That is a part of the great solution. It's very powerful.<br>So, I went on a tangent there, but that's what your comment reminded me of—the value of here.<br>No, 100%. Yeah, absolutely. And why—what are the benefits then of being here? Why don't we just stay in the non-physical if it's so full of love and it's so great, and you know, we're in this place? Why even—why are we—why come here then?<br><br><br>Yeah, so there's a type of evolution and expansion that is only possible—well, I don't want to limit it. There's a type of evolution and expansion possible on Earth that is very unique. I'll put it that way and basically not possible unless we're under this level of constraints. So, I'll just use a metaphor that I like for this. You know, if you're sitting on your living room couch and you're watching TV, and you're nice and comfortable, and you've got full access to the snacks, you know, everything's great. Why would you ever get up and go for a run? Like, why would you do that? <br>Why would you get up and put your body under stress? Well, because when you get back, you're stronger, and now when you sit on the couch, you can actually enjoy it in a way that you couldn't even before because now you know what it's like to have gone for a run. So, Earth is a very high contrast—potentially high contrast. It's a lot—has a lot of potential for very high contrast simulation. You know, a place that we can come and experience potentially very high contrast for the purposes of growth, expansion, personal expansion, and the expansion of all that is. We're actually participating in a collective expansion as well. And we're very creative and curious beings, so we do it. You know, we're—and we know our true immortal nature. <br>We know we can't truly be harmed, so you know, why—I mean, here's another metaphor that might be helpful. You know, why would you watch a scary movie when it might scare you? Well, you can't really be hurt, but it's kind of a neat experience. I mean, I personally don't like scary movies, but I'm just saying it's the ability to have an experience that can stimulate you in a way that otherwise you wouldn't be able to experience. Being human is kind of like that. Like, we come to a place where we can actually experience being scared or being harmed or, you know, having to make decisions and relationships. Oh, my gosh, all the complexity of relationships and so many opportunities—such a rich, beautiful context to do that here in a place where we don't have full conscious access, and we have to deal with what's just in front of us and with the feedback we're getting. <br>That's a very rich context through which we can actually grow towards love, actually actualize and bring love into a real context. It's one thing to—you might say like another metaphor is you know, you can go to school and you can read about how to repair cars in books all you want, but until you get underneath the car and get your hands dirty, you know, you don't really know how to fix a car. So, it's a little bit like that with actualizing love and different virtues or you could say virtues in context. Being human is an incredible context through which to develop that ability because it's high contrast.<br>Yeah, no, makes sense. Makes sense. I always kind of think of it like we're a nerve ending to consciousness, and we're here, and we're kind of—I like that—having our experience, but at the same time, we're actually putting information back and contributing to the larger source. I like that even though we are part—yeah, the human personality as a nerve ending. And I also like that because the human personality portion of us is such a small portion of the whole. You know, we think this is all we are, but the I that is knowing the human experience is much bigger. So, I like that metaphor for that.<br>Incredible. Yeah, look, I can't believe we've nearly gone for an hour already. Unbelievable, mate. It's been a fascinating conversation, and I've got probably another 20 questions for you, but you might have to come back on the show at some stage if that's all right.<br>That would be wonderful.<br>But I loved—I'd love to ask a couple of questions just every week as well, and one is: What is it—what does your morning routine look like? Do you get up and meditate every morning? Have you got like this complete ritual, or do you just enjoy getting entrenched in the ego, or what do you do?<br>That's a good question. Well, for me, my meditations are usually in the evening. I do try to make that a routine. I'm a morning person, so I like getting up early. As soon as I get up, I like to be productive. My wife is the opposite, but I like being productive five minutes after I'm awake. So, I have two young children. I usually make them lunches and help get them on school buses. Right now, I'm in between jobs, but typically, I'm working, and so of course, I go to work. <br>But you know, it's like the routine that we have. Okay, so I'll say that it is important to have a routine because we need to set aside time in our lives because otherwise, we can get so wrapped up in the thinking and in the story all the time. I find that having a meditation time every day is very valuable, even if I feel that I can't really meditate that day, that's fine. I still put aside the time. <br>I allow myself to arrive to it however I can. And then as we go through the day, I find that it's very valuable throughout the day. This isn't really a routine, but it's just something I find that I'm constantly recognizing is the importance of mindfulness in even simple activities like in the morning when I'm making a lunch or in the middle of the day, whatever I'm doing, just being fully present with it, just experiencing it. There's a lot to be said for that as well. So, that's not a specific routine, but it may be worth mentioning.<br>Yeah, no, perfect. Thank you. And have there been any mentors or books that have influenced your journey? Yeah, from when you started having these memories?<br>Yeah, absolutely. I can think of three sources that I would say are—I don't know if I can use the word "mentor" loosely, but three sources have been very helpful for me. One is Tom Campbell, yeah, the physicist and consciousness explorer that I mentioned before. I read his "My Big TOE" trilogy over two years with a pen in hand. That was early in my awakening process that kind of kicked me down his path, and really, the most important thing Tom recommended was meditation, and he gave a meditation exercise which I basically still use to this day and I reiterated in slightly different format in my own book. That was very helpful.<br>And the other—I'm sorry, yeah, I've had Tom on the show twice, actually. Sorry, I've had Tom on the show twice. Tom's amazing. I love Tom so much. I've never physically met him, but I look forward to whether physically or not physically giving him a huge hug someday. I'm very grateful to him. Okay, so the other two sources I'll mention—one, the second is these are actually both channeled sources, and I'm usually very skeptical and hesitant about channeled sources. There's a lot of difference in quality, but I'll just mention two that I've found to be wonderful. <br>One is Silver Birch, who is a channeled guide in the 1930s through a man named Maurice Barbanel in the UK. Very hard to find in the United States. I had to order my books from Britain, but his language and articulateness is just breathtakingly beautiful. I read Silver Birch to my wife sometimes at night when we're going to sleep, you know, just try to like even if it's just a paragraph, just kind of bring it out. That's been very helpful for me. Not that it's like comprehensive information, but it's just so beautiful, and I feel the energy. I feel energy sometimes. <br>I feel the energy of the author, and that alone, just the energy, is like a signpost or something. It helps me. And lastly, I'll say Seth Speaks—the Seth Speaks series by Jane Roberts. Seth was channeled in the 1970s by a woman named Jane Roberts in New York here in the USA. His main book is "The Eternal Validity of the Soul." Seth tends to focus on the topic of how our beliefs create our reality. <br>That's his main focus, but I still have appreciated a lot of the content in several of his books. He's pretty repetitive, but I found that that repetition was very helpful and necessary for me. It's just important because we have such deep assumptions about how reality works, and sometimes we have to hear something a couple hundred times before we really go, "Wait, really? Is it possible? Could it really be like that?" So, Seth's work is a little bit like that for me, but again, I love the energy and I love the content he brings forth.<br>Great, thank you. And I'll make sure they're all in the show notes below this podcast for anyone that's going to see this right now as well. I want to check that out as well. Yeah, and last question, Christian, just to wrap it up today like with everything we've covered—which has been a lot—is there anything you would like to leave the listeners to ponder on?<br>Yes, yeah, I think the most important thing I can share today is whoever you are listening, please be reminded: You are not just a human. You're not just the human character. You're not the human. You're not just your story. You're your spirit, your consciousness itself that is knowing this human experience, and there is nothing in it that you ultimately need to fear. You are a being of love and joy and peace and freedom and creativity. That's what you are. <br>And I really hope that you can feel that at least a tiny little bit—feel deep within. Let go of your own story for just a minute. Let go of the stresses and the anxieties and the must-do's and the must-be's, and just allow yourself to know—like, let it rise up in a way that's beneath the conditioned thinking mind, and feel who you are because that's really who you are—not just this human character. So, I hope that can be freeing to someone who might be listening today. I know we get lost in the stories quite easily. I get lost in my story very commonly, so I know how easy it is for that to happen.<br>Yes, but stories are also very powerful, and they're a great way in to create more curiosity to then begin to start practicing and embodying this work.<br>Yes, that's interesting. I love it, Christian. Where can I send everyone to if they want to grab a copy of your book, want to get on a newsletter? Do you do a newsletter? Are there people—yeah, you can visit my website. My website is at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://www.awalkinthephysical.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://www.awalkinthephysical.com." target="_blank">www.awalkinthephysical.com.</a> I have a book page there with links to the book on Amazon, and the third link down on that page is to the free version, which is on Google Books. Anybody can read it for free. I can also be reached at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com</a> if you'd like to email me, and I'm happy to talk to anybody I can. There's been a lot of emails lately. I'll do my best. I am happy to talk to everybody that I can.<br>Well, you were very punctual with me as well, Christian, so I appreciate it. You know, I'm not sure after doing 190 interviews. I've seen it all in the way people's organization skills are there, and you're fantastic, mate. So, I appreciate it. Look, Christian, thanks for all that you do. Thank you for having the courage to step out and share your message with the world because it's very powerful.<br>It's certainly got me pondering on a lot of many things, and I just love being open to explore, having a platform like this where I can have people like yourself on and have these conversations and then share them with others as well. So, it's been a great privilege for me today to have you on and to have you share so honestly and openly from the heart, Christian. Thank you for all that you do, mate. Thank you for all you do. Thank you for the choices you made to get here because you had to make many personal, difficult decisions to be at this point where you're sharing this information and sharing all your guests. I mean, you made sacrifices, so thank you for your valuable choices as well. Much appreciated.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2021/my-life-between-lives-experience.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2021/My Life Between Lives Experience.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:03:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[<strong>PRE-BIRTH EXPERIENCE: Life Before Birth, The Spirit of God, Choice &amp; The Veil </strong>]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=sEYvYX7Tcmk  <br>13 MAR 2021<br><br><br>Hello, passionate listeners and watchers! Welcome to Passion Harvest. Thank you so much for being here, wherever you are in the world. I'm Luisa, your host, International Passion Ambassador. I'm so excited about my guest today, Christian Sundberg. If you don't know who he is, Christian Sundberg remembered his existence before coming to Earth.  <br>This pre-birth memory left him completely after childhood and spontaneously returned 10 years ago when Christian took up a meditation practice and experienced a personal awakening journey. While remembering pre-birth memories, Christian began to have out-of-body experiences (OBEs). Christian is the author of the upcoming book A Walk in the Physical, exploring the largest spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love on our human journey. This is his story, and this is his passion.  <br>Christian, welcome to Passion Harvest. I'm so excited to finally have you on the show. Welcome!  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Thank you. I guess I'll dive right in. Before I start, I just want to say that what I'm going to attempt to talk about is beyond language. It's just not speakable because our higher natures—what we really are and where we come from, the higher realms—are so vastly beyond anything that can be said with our local language. You know, the language we use on Earth is form symbols, and what we really are transcends form, transcends the form of this world. So there's nothing I can say to successfully articulate this, but I'll give it a shot.  <br>Okay, so when I was a small child, I remembered existing before I had been human, and nobody else really spoke about it, so I didn't either. I used to draw on the memories that I'd come with early in my life as a way to kind of peek ahead and see what to expect. And then, as I got older, those memories left me. Certainly, by the age of six or seven, I had no memory after that. So for all of my early adult life, I had no recollection of this at all.  <br>Then, about 10 years ago, when I was 30 (my body is 40 now), I began a long-term meditation practice, and as I meditated, I found that these memories spontaneously returned. And when they returned, it was just like, "Oh my gosh, how did I ever forget that?" It was the most natural thing in the world. I couldn't believe that I had forgotten. And then also, I began to have non-physical experiences, out-of-body experiences, and they were extremely eye-opening, very in-my-face, and my worldview quickly changed, especially as I remembered what I'm doing here.  <br>Okay, so I'll start at what I would call the beginning of the memory that's here for me, but there is not really—I can't really speak well to the order because, while there is a sequence to these memories, they all also feel like they're happening simultaneously, all at once, like now, not even in the past. They're right now too. So I don't know exactly how to speak to that.  <br><br><br>Okay, so long ago, before I had ever been physical, I remember coming across a being who had been physical. And when I came across him, I was absolutely inspired by the quality of his nature, the quality of what he was. And I asked him—and again, this isn't words; this is all telepathic communication. It was just an exchange of feeling and information. I asked him, "My goodness, look at you. Are you really like, do you really feel as free and powerful and bright and full of joy and everything that I feel from you?" And he said, "Yes," and he shared it.  <br>And I couldn't believe it, and I said, "Well, what did you do to be this? What could you possibly do for this?" And he described that he had lived physical lives—I won't say human—he had lived physical lives, and I don't know what he was, but he shared one in particular in which he suffered a physical ailment, a pain of some kind, that was with him for many years. And it was an extreme difficulty for him, and how he chose to meet that experience allowed a certain refinement of who he was, of his being.  <br>And I was completely blown away, and I asked him, "Were you healed?" You know, because I could feel how deep this injury had been for him in his life. And he shared, "Yes." He shared the depth of his healing. I could feel how his being had been healed since the physical life. And I was so inspired, and I said, "I want to do that. I'm going to do that. I am going to do that." I was just very definitive.  <br><br><br>And not brushing me off, but he kind of said, "Well, that's what they all say." And I was persistent. I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do this. I'm going to be physical." And he said, "Well, it's hard in a way that you've never known before." And it was a very real communication effect, and I said, "I'm okay with that." He said, "Well, go talk to your guides." So I did.  <br>And I don't remember right after that, but I remember going back and finding this being much later after I had lived many lives and sharing with him some of what I had done. And I said, "See, I'm in the process of doing this. I'm not all the way there yet, but I'm doing this." And he was encouraging, but I knew it wasn't done yet.  <br>So okay, now I'm going to fast forward a bit because okay, so there was activity between there—a lot of it I don't remember—but most of the memory that I have is about a time immediately preceding this life or somewhat immediately, where I had lived several lives, and I was taking a very long break in between. I just decided I was taking a long break. I wasn't doing this for a long time. I was just taking a break from the physical thing.  <br>And I remember this guide coming to me every so often and saying, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And I kept putting him off for a while, and eventually, I agreed, "Okay, I'm ready to go back."  <br><br><br>And I remember meeting with this guide and reviewing with him what I can only describe as my state—who I am, who I had been, what I was. And it was very obvious the thing that I needed to do or to work on in my next incarnation. It was like, not quite like this, but it's just a metaphor, but it's like if you look at a chart or something, it was like there was one part that was just glaring, like, "Oh yeah, I really need to do something about that."  <br>And it was a fear that I had experienced in a past life that had bested me in that past life. And what I mean is, this fear had taken a life of its own in this previous life and led me down a path which made me a very nasty person in that life. I was a very destructive individual, and I ended up dying an agonizing death in that life because of this fear.  <br>And so, subsequently, now I could see that that was a part of me, and so I wanted to re-engage that fear—not because I had to or something, but because I knew that if I could re-engage this fear and if I could integrate it, then there would be a profound expansion of being, an expansion of joy and love, and it would just be unfathomably beautiful.  <br>But I also could see even then that the depth of this fear was so extreme in a certain vibrational way. It was just so extreme that I remember asking the guide, "Is it even possible? Has it ever been done? Has anything this extreme in this way ever been done at all?" And he said, "Yes, and you have all time available to you to do so. There's no hurry."  <br><br><br>And I knew with confidence, if it can be done, I can do it. If it is possible at all, then I will do it. And so, they brought me a life that was perfect for this intention to re-engage this low vibration. And I reviewed that life, and I accepted it, and I accepted the veil—the veil of forgetfulness—which is the thing I remember most about this memory.  <br>This process of accepting the veil, which is a necessary part of coming to be physical, I described it and shared this in other videos as well, but it's like having an obscuring limitation placed over your consciousness that's so extreme that you feel like you dive down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower to a place where your knowing is cut off, and your connection to all things feels like it disappears. It feels like it's gone.  <br>So you go from an extremely high vibration place—I like describing it like an amplifier that produces a pitch or something like that, and then you turn the knob, and it goes except this one, you just get to the bottom, and then you keep turning lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more lower still, lower more. Like that's what it felt like being veiled down all the way vibrationally into this physical experience.  <br><br><br>And when I arrived, I was overwhelmed by the fear that I immediately experienced as a response to being cut off from who I really was, being cut off from my knowing, and feeling separate from everything else. And I don't know how long I was there, but it wasn't very long because I was still in the womb when I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. This is ridiculous. I'm not doing this."  <br>And so I summoned my might, and I smoked the veil. I fought my way out, and I succeeded in doing that, but I became aware that I had killed the fetus that was to be the body that I was to live in. And I had a life review for that very, very short life, and I became aware—I knew in detail how I had made the mother's journey more difficult, and not only the poor mother, but hundreds of other people, like ripples away from the mother.  <br>I was aware that there were hundreds of other people whose journeys had been made more difficult because of my fear right at the beginning. And I had so many good intentions going into this, so when I saw this and knew this, I thought, "Oh, I really gotta work on this." Like, I couldn't believe it, in a sense. It's hard to describe this because, from that state of being, you know that all is well. There's no fundamental problem or something, but still, I saw what I was and what I had done.  <br>Yeah, and I really wanted to do better. So I spent some time in what I can only describe as a veil acceptance simulator. It's like a room where you go, and they put a mock veil over you, and you practice surrendering to it. It's like going into a dark pool where you go deep underwater, and then you see how long you can stay underwater. This is just a metaphor—see how long you can stay underwater until you cry uncle, you know, and then they let you out because it's just a simulator.  <br>It's like that, and I did that for a while, but I can tell you the real thing is more difficult than the simulator. Anyway, after this experience, they brought me this life, and I reviewed this life, and I knew that it was good. It was not as good as the first one would have been, but it was still good. It was just good. It wasn't perfect.  <br><br><br>And I remember reviewing what I can only describe as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how things might unfold in this life and probably would or probably wouldn't unfold. Like, if you lay a tree on its side, and the trunk is thick at the place where you start, and then it kind of goes out to branches, it was kind of like that, except it was millions and millions of possibilities as to what might happen, what would likely happen.  <br>And there was a certain energetic trajectory that this life had, and I knew that after my 20s, I would end up in an energetic place that was further than I'd ever gone before in a certain direction. And I also knew that in my 20s, I would very likely be traumatized significantly by a certain experience, and that did happen.  <br>So I reviewed all this, and I was filled with excitement. I think the overarching emotion that I can describe in this whole process is excitement—excitement of the opportunity to be this and do this, and also excitement because the opportunity to be human is so precious. It was like being given the most precious gift in the universe—the opportunity to be this, to do this, when there's only so many slots, you know? There's only so many open opportunities, and there's way more spirits than there are opportunities.  <br>So being offered an opportunity to be human is just such an honor in itself. So I reviewed this life, and I remember there having to be a moment to accept it, and I don't remember that moment, but I do remember a waiting period after that where I was in this in-between place, and I was still timeless.  <br>And I remember the guides suddenly coming to me and grabbing my attention, like, "Go now, like right now," not rude, but almost rude, like they had to grab me and really shake me out of the state I was in to kind of get me to enter Earth time at the right window or something. And the next moment, I was with these beings that I can only describe as technicians or tinkerers—that's the best English word I can think of that kind of describes the energy of what they are.  <br>And they're like technical in nature, and for me, they did this thing where they help apply the veil to you. They match because the soul has certain rich, complex qualities, and the life has its own thing going on, and they do this thing in the body, and they make it all jive and make it all fit.  <br>And they had this prepared, and I remember being in this place that can only be described as like a room with like a shaft, and I remember them saying one last time, "Are you sure? Are you sure you want to do this?" Because I knew that once I said yes here, that was it. I was in for the ride. I was strapped in.  <br>And I said, "Yes." And so then the veil came over me again, and as the veil came over me this time, I focused. I got so all my energy was gathered, and the veil came over me, and I focused completely on just not fighting it, just basically letting the veil do what it will do to take hold of me, like letting it take hold within my being, within the body of my consciousness.  <br>And I remember the plummet again—lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, even lower—and having my knowing cut off and feeling all of a sudden very alone and in the dark. And holding on and holding on and holding on and holding on, and then eventually sending a message back through there's like this little window that was still open, and I sent this little message back through to the technicians, "Did it take?" And getting one message back, "Yes."  <br>And so I knew that I was there. So then I was in the womb, and it was okay for a while, and then eventually I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this. I'm not doing it. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I am not going to tolerate this." I couldn't believe the breathtaking lowness of the vibration of this state, this goalful state, in comparison to where I had been.  <br><br><br>So I began to summon my might to fight my way out again, and as I did that, this most holy moment happened for me where what I can only describe as the spirit of God came to me, and it showed me what I really still was and what I really still am and what we are. And I saw the stars and the whole universe and all things, and they were in me, and I was of them, and it was bliss.  <br>And I felt the churning of the sun and the bliss of the turning of the sun, and the spirit said to me—God said to me, whatever word we want to use, Source—"This is still what you are. You can never not be this."  <br>So it's hard for me to think about because I miss it so much. I'm happy to be here. I'm proud, you know, in a sense of pride, but I'm honored to be here. I don't mean to make light of the opportunity, but I miss that state so much.  <br>But anyway, so after this moment, I was calm because I was like, "Oh, that's really what I am. Okay, oh, that's wonderful." So I let go into the simple existence of being in the womb, and the next memory I have is of being born.  <br>I only have one visual image memory of being born. I remember seeing the room after they had pulled me out, and years later, I drew the room from my mother. I said, "You were here. Here was the doctor. Here was the heating grate. Here was the window." I remembered it, and she said I was right. I mean, I knew I would be, but just that one visual memory.  <br>But the memory is more about the shock and the intense curiosity that I remember having right after I was born. I remember this overload of sensory data—sight and sound and touching and cold—but there was no context for it. I hadn't—I did not understand at all what was happening. I just knew things were happening, and I knew that these people around me, the nurses or whatever, I knew they were beings, and they were taking care of me somehow, but I didn't know. I couldn't conceive it. There was no conceptual understanding of what was happening, but I remember feeling love for those beings.  <br>And I remember being so curious and just looking around like, "What is this place? Where am I? Where am I?" And yeah, so it was just very intense. So I don't have any memories after that for some number of years, but as I grew, I remember expecting certain things that were true in the other realities would be true here.  <br><br><br>For instance, I remember expecting that we would be able to feel each other's emotions here because, in other reality systems, it's very normal for beings to be able to share their feelings and share who they really are. And so, I remember being young enough that I was in a diaper, and my parents had a neighbor friend over, and I remember this record being on a record player, and there was music playing.  <br>And I remember telling the neighbor friend, "Watch me dance," and then standing at the couch and shaking my little tush, and I remember she just walked away unimpressed, and I was like, "What? What is going on?" Because it occurred to me that she couldn't feel what I was feeling. And when I realized that, I thought, "Where am I? What kind of an alien place is this that we cannot feel each other's emotions? What is going on?"  <br>It was just dumbfounding to me. I was just shocked, like, "Where am I?" And then I had other assumptions that I assumed that even now, sometimes this crops up, and I feel like this is the way it should be, but on Earth, things are slightly different.  <br>I remember expecting that people in positions of authority or leadership would be loving and wise because, in other systems, the beings who were in roles of authority or guidance were loving and wise. So I assumed here on Earth, if you were like a teacher of a classroom, you must be loving and wise, and if you were the mayor of a city, you must be really loving and wise, and if you were the president of the United States, you must be the wisest and the most loving person there is.  <br>Well, that's not how it works on Earth—not always the case, not always the case here. So I feel like I've always had to kind of come to terms with the nature of this experience. But in this pre-birth review, I remember asking to have a small amount of memory this time, very small, and I remember them saying I could do that, but it would make this journey more difficult.  <br>And I knew that that was the case because the contrast would be even greater. But I knew that even that contrast was an opportunity. I knew that that contrast was an opportunity for growth, so I agreed.  <br>So yeah, that's a quick summary.  <br><br><br>Luisa:<br>
Thank you so much for sharing those remarkable experiences. I just want to ask you a few questions if that's okay.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Sure.  <br>Luisa:<br>
I just want to say real quick, I don't feel that it's remarkable, and the thing that was remarkable to me is that everyone doesn't remember. We all are far more than the human character that we are currently experiencing being, and I'm certainly in no way special. It's just something that we all do. We all know it's just part of the game here is to forget. That's part of the nature of being human, so I don't consider it remarkable, but I appreciate your kindness.  <br>Luisa:<br>
This is going to be one of these interviews where you preempt all my questions. It happens to me a lot lately. So, the veil—why is the veil put on us, in your opinion?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Well, there are a few important reasons, but first of all, say that if you weren't veiled, you would be the unveiled you—the whole you, the you that knows actively and feels actively that you are connected to all things and that you are one with all and that the universe is in you and you in it. And you would feel and know tangibly much, much more than just what's in front of you.  <br>So, in order to have the experience of being human and being this human character—getting up in the morning, driving through traffic, going to work, eating your breakfast, and all that—if you were to focus on being that and having the experience of that, the veil is actually very helpful, even necessary, so that we can be that perspective.  <br>Because there's an incredible value to having the experience of being that perspective. We come to have that perspective, and here on Earth, we tend to think that the state of separation—being separate from one another—is normal. It's not the normal state. The normal state is connectedness and knowing our unity, and this is actually a rather extreme and alien type of experience that we come to by comparison.  <br>I mean, to know separation—so if you really want to know what it's like to be separate and to have to bring the love of what we are here into this separation, into this context, the only way to do so is to be veiled.  <br>Being veiled is also helpful in that we tend to develop—because we have fear—unevolvingness is another word we could use for fear. We have fear, so in previous lives, we tend to get stuck in ego patterns—beliefs or certain kinds of hang-ups that can get firmed up over life, and the veil allows us to have a new personality that is free of much of that.  <br>I mean, there are certainly elements that traverse experience to experience, but for a given life, it can be helpful to be veiled and to have a fresh start. It's still the same you, still the same experience—it's not a different person—but now you have a fresh start.  <br>And also, it's helpful because it prevents us from having really significant homesickness. Because if you knew all of what we are and where we come from, oh my gosh, just getting through your day would be almost impossible because the yearning to be there, to go there, and to enjoy the depths of being that are possible in those higher realms would be overwhelming.  <br>Whereas now, here we are—I don't want to use the word "blissfully ignorant," but we're able to be shielded so that we can focus on being a creature, having the experience of creaturehood, you know, biological.  <br><br><br>Luisa:<br>
I've often been asked the question, and I'm sure you have as well, if we're in such a high vibrational state over there—I'm just going to call it "over there," the different realm, the different dimension, heaven—there's many names for it—why do we need to come to human form to experience suffering, pain, the veil?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
So, it's not really a need because I will say very strongly, at least in my experience, I feel strongly that all incarnation is done out of free will choice. There is no such thing as, in my opinion, being forced to incarnate.  <br>And the reason—and I just want to say that first because that's important—because the spirit itself is sovereign. Consciousness is like you're of Source. There is no greater level of authority or something. You're a part of it. So the only way to be obscured to all of what you really are is to volunteer to do so, to allow yourself to be veiled.  <br>So why do we do that? That's your question. So, okay, this is really hard to describe, but I'm going to give it a shot.  <br>Luisa:<br>
You're doing an amazing job.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Thank you. It's really intimidating because I feel like every time I open my mouth, I'm just wrong. There's just no words for any of this, so it's like—anyway, okay.  <br>So, there is an important process happening, which I will simply describe as evolution or expansion. And what is it? The expansion of what is—the capital W and a capital I—and it's the expansion of joy and love.  <br>Okay, so Source is like a sun or a ball of light, and it's the origin, and what we really are—imagine if, as a part of it, you can go vibrationally, I don't know, this far or maybe this far, maybe even this far away. If you can be there and fully integrate that experience and allow your loving true nature to actualize there and to be present there, then there's this expansion that takes place of being—not just you but the whole because you are a part of the whole.  <br>So, this expansion that's possible is tremendous. When we talk about the opportunities on Earth, Earth is such a high-opportunity place. It is so precious in the extremity of potential that is available to us in that expansive process.  <br>And so, we're serving not only ourselves—I'm not saying it's about serving ourselves; I'm just using these words—we're not only serving ourselves by doing it, we're serving the whole by participating because even just by being, just you and having your preferences, your experience, your perspective, and your contrast, that is additive. It is a helpful creation of perspective that is useful within the whole, within all that is.  <br>So we do it for the expansion of love and joy, and that is a service. And we also do it because we are beings of fun and joy and creativity, and there is a remarkable amount of creative experiential creativity that is possible when we come and have the experience of being physical or being human.  <br>Because this is such an extreme environment—the biological Earth world—it's such an extreme environment because of that, when creativity can express here, it is also remarkable in how that can—I don't know how to describe this—it's not just the creativity in the local sense; it's creativity in the spiritual sense.  <br>Like, a small creation on Earth might be a tremendous, huge creation in other reality systems and higher systems that are thought-responsive. And in that way, we are participating in a much bigger creative process than what we visually see in front of our eyes.  <br>So those are just two comments.  <br>Luisa:<br>
Knowing how that was great in the whole multi-dimensional realm, and it was explained very well because often we, as humans, say, "Well, what's in it for me? What am I getting out of it?" But when we realize that when we heal ourselves or when we heal other people, we're actually healing the collective consciousness or enhancing the collective consciousness.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yes, I want to say one other reason, and that is that we are beings of love. Love is what we are. Okay, if there's nothing else that we take away from this conversation, I hope that whoever is listening would be reminded that you are loved. You are loved deeply, so deeply loved that you would be brought to your knees if you knew even the tiniest fraction of the unbelievable, powerful, universe-shattering love that there is for you.  <br>Okay, so that much love is what we are and more. And then, when our friends and family—our brothers and sisters—are coming to be physical, one of the reasons we come then is because they've come, and we want to help and participate in that process with them and for them too.  <br>So, the reasons for incarnation may be very specific to an individual, and I'm just saying that one of those reasons is the service of other people. It may be that someone comes just to be a friend to someone who they know from ancient, many other experiences that they want to help in some way, or we might come to fulfill some role for somebody else.  <br>There may be somebody who wants to experience a very specific thing, and we come to be the parent or the brother or sister or whatever that will help them have that experience. So we do it out of service too.  <br><br><br>Luisa:<br>
Beautifully explained. This is a hard one for you, and I know it's hard to put into words: What does home feel like?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Oh, man. If I fought too hard on it, I would cry.  <br>Luisa:<br>
It's okay to cry. People cry. I cry all the time.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Oh, yeah. So, I think if the listener pictures home and the feeling that their home is home—their truest home, who they really are, and where they really belong—take that feeling and magnify it by a thousand or more, maybe a million. And that belongingness, that naturalness, that connectedness, that acceptance is what we are.  <br>And home is not just a place. You know, we like to think about reality as being places—so we're here, and there must be this other place that's home, and we're in a place. It's okay to think of it like that while we're human, but environment places arise within that which is—that which is being, this life itself with a capital L, spirit, consciousness, whatever word we want to use.  <br>What we really are has no—it can't be described, and within that arises many reality systems of rich complexity and many rules. And I'm just saying that in the context of this question because home can mean different things to different people. There are many higher realms, and I won't get into that.  <br>Oh, I wasn't—I just know that there are higher realms, and they can be experienced through out-of-body experiences and others. And so, when we talk about home, we may be talking about a heavenly reality system; we may be talking about even higher states. You know, there's a lot to that. It's like the afterlife is not just one place. It's an extremely rich, complex, multi-layered, extremely deep multiverse.  <br>You know, and Earth is just the tiniest, tiniest, tiniest little corner of one reality system. But anyway, so back to your original question: Home is what we are. You know, we are beingness that knows no bounds. We are love that has no limitation. We are freedom. We are joy. We are limitless. We are acceptance. We are expression of all good things—creativity. We are color and sound and poetry. We are the wind. We are the bark on the tree. We are more than this, and that's the beauty.  <br>Is that we never leave home, put it that way. Like, we get really, really deep into the physical experience—very deep. That's the nature of being human—like, how deep, how extreme can we go into denseness and separation? We are testing the boundaries of that right now. But even as we do that, we could say metaphorically, we never leave.  <br>It's metaphorically like we fall asleep in heaven to have the dream of being physical. This reality, as real as it is, is a real experience, but the physical is like the dream. And when the physical is relinquished and let go, the higher realms, the higher states of being, are far more real and rich and beyond any earthly description. This place is like the black-and-white movie by comparison.  <br><br><br>Luisa:<br>
Is there a point—well, there's no time—is there a point after multiple and multiple reincarnations that we no longer need to come back to the physical form or no longer—not need, but choose?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, I imagine that there's probably—I don't know for certain, but I feel that it's very likely that eventually, this form of expansion and expression will be one that we choose to not pursue further. But because the nature of the physical experience is so rich and high-contrast, there is so much potential here that it is common for individuals to—I don't want to say "get stuck" because it's not really stuck—but for individuals to process more than one experience.  <br>Luisa:<br>
Well, there's so many probabilities, aren't there?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
There are.  <br>Luisa:<br>
Do you think we can be living multiple realities at the same time?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yes, yeah. The soul is—so, metaphorically, if this is like playing a video game—this is just a metaphor—but if you're sitting down at the computer playing a game, the soul is not limited to playing one game. It can play multiple computers at the same time—something like that.  <br>Luisa:<br>
Yeah, like parallel timelines. Is that, in your opinion, based on the choices that we make—free will—that lead us in another direction or another timeline?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
So, I feel that timelines are—I feel that my current understanding is that there are actualized timelines and unactualized timelines. And to borrow some terms from Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer who I'm a big fan of—he's an awesome man—he describes a database in the spirit where it records all actualized paths and many, many, many unactualized paths—billions upon billions upon billions of unactualized paths.  <br>And those unactualized paths can then go be experienced, and like a computer—this is again just a metaphor—but like a computer, the system can take a screenshot of any one of those unactualized paths and reload it and have new players assigned to it. So, anyway, I'm just putting that in context because I think it's a rather complex system.  <br>It's hard to nail down from here, but yes, our free will choices are constantly taking us down different avenues. Like, in my pre-birth experience, when I reviewed the flowchart of what this life could be like or would be like, the factor which made the probabilities higher or lower was free will. It was my choices and the choices of every other participant because they're like—so there's like these energetic seasons or movements that happen through the species even, and those movements affect the context of the play.  <br>Like, there might be an overarching theme of a given place that has an effect on the choices that people are making there, and all that ties together, and it seems to us as humans ridiculously complex—like trillions upon trillions upon trillions upon trillions of infinite voices, yeah, basically infinite. But to spirit, the spirit has—to use another Tom Campbell term—a huge amount of processing power, infinite knowledge. It is no problem processing all these probabilities, so it can predict ahead of time what is likely to happen.  <br>And then, here's an important thing: This physical experience is a novel experience, meaning that the choices that are being made are affecting outcomes in ways that might be unanticipated. And that is a part of the incredible value actually of the human experience—that things happen that were not anticipated, and it, for lack of a better word, forces other avenues. And in the end, that process is ultimately creative.  <br>And that's important too—not to get down another tangent—but it just reminds me of how we see destruction around us, right? Sometimes things get destroyed; people die; people get sick; natural disasters happen. And it's hard for us to see past the loss and the destruction, but that is a part of the creativity possible on that that is not otherwise possible.  <br>Luisa:<br>
So, when you saw the spreadsheet or the pre-plan of your life or the main trajectories of your life, did you see all the way up until you return to the non-physical—the main highways that may occur or the most likely probability of what will happen?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yes, yeah. I even reviewed it in terms of numerical ages. I remember knowing it would probably be 22 or 23 where I would have my trauma, and that did happen when I was 22. I am currently aware of a potential exit point that I won't discuss. I don't know if it's going to happen or not, but I remember knowing that past my early 30s, I would be so far down this certain energetic trajectory that it would be hard to see.  <br>I don't know—I mean, that's not the right word—not hard to see, but it would be the branches were thinner and more difficult to nail down, and that's where I am now. Like, I feel right now like I am very far out in the wilderness in a certain direction, and I actually have a yearning to decompress—not that I want to say die, I'm going to physically die—but when this journey is over, I look forward to a life review and to basically process everything I've experienced thus far.  <br><br><br>Luisa:<br>
Can I ask what the fear was that you had to—that you requested to relearn in this lifetime?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, yeah. Okay, so when we think about fear, we tend to think of a fear of something—you know, like a fear of heights or something—and that's okay. But I'm using fear in a deeper sense, and it's more like a vibrational distance from Source.  <br>So, in my case, the fear can best be described as the inability—the perception of inability—to escape agony mixed with being too proud to suffer. And I had an experience in China. I tried to move to China after college because I had studied in ATM when I was 20, and I had an experience when I was 22 where I had a heat stroke, and I was in a Chinese hospital for four days, and they gave me bag after bag after bag of potassium, and it fried my nervous system somehow.  <br>And that's one thing I'll just mention that in my pre-birth experience, I was aware that this body has certain biological limitations that other bodies do not, and I knew it would make my journey more difficult and it would push me in some extreme directions in my experience.  <br>So, I had this traumatic experience, and you know, I was forced to face and feel what ultimately was the fear of being unable to escape pain and being too proud to accept that I was in this state. And I had—I saw this—this was an extremely physically painful whatever happened to me. It lasted for months. My body did not sweat for 10 months. I was in constant physical pain.  <br>And after weeks of this, I had kind of—I like, I became traumatized. I had post-traumatic stress disorder for about eight years, and I could not even remember my life before the age of 22 very well at all. My psyche blocked off—that's kind of a normal thing in post-traumatic experience.  <br>So, I went through years of counseling, and through that—through EMDR therapy is what it was called—and through a very skilled practitioner, I did experience layer after layer after layer, deeper and deeper, towards the sphere. And eventually, after years, it did re-meet the actual deepest fear that I'm here to feel, and it was breathtakingly low vibration.  <br>But I am no longer—I don't need to resist it as the fear arises and as the experience manifests in whatever way it will. I accept it as it arises. I choose not to resist reality. Reality is not my enemy. My experience is not my enemy, and I know that there is profound value in facing whatever I feel.  <br>And at the time, I did not have my pre-birth memory available to me, so it was quite terrifying. It was only after processing the fear to a great depth that the memory began to return. And so now, it's inspirationally helpful for me because now I remember, "Oh, that's fine. I'm meant to be dealing with this." And meant to be dealing with this is helpful, you know, and I can feel that it's helpful in ways.  <br>And it's not something I can even do all at once. I don't think—I don't know. I guess I won't put any limits on it. I just know that I have taken very important steps so far in integrating this type of experience.  <br>Luisa:<br>
What would you say to people that are afraid of dying?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Okay, well, there is no death. Okay, I know that it looks like there's death because bodies deteriorate and cease to function, you know, but there is no death. And in fact, death is the most wonderful thing because it is not just not an end; it is actually a freedom, a release, a removal of constraints.  <br>This state of being human is the more dead state. I'm not speaking negatively or against this precious experience of being human, but this is the far more limited and difficult state. Death is a release. It's like taking off a heavy spacesuit or a very tight shirt or climbing out of a small metal can or something and expanding back to incredible breath and freedom and joy.  <br>And that is a most almost wonderful process. It's something that I very much look forward to. I'm not wishing to die, but I relate to near-death experiencers who speak about yearning to go home. And there's nothing terrible about that. It is a wonderful, wonderful thing. It is a release and a freedom, not an end. No, the end is an illusion.  <br>Luisa:<br>
That's very comforting. Do we have a little bit of time to speak about your out-of-body experiences?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Sure. So, that's why I consider myself a neophyte in that arena, but I have had a few experiences. I'll just stay at a high level.  <br>So, I've had experiences where, from a meditative state, I am non-local. So, I am not me as a body; I am everywhere, and that is blissful and wonderful. I've had experiences where my body sleeps, and I am fully lucid and conscious in some other environment—whether it be like this local world.  <br>I've had one experience—only one—where I was walking around my house, but I didn't know I was out of body because it was so normal and so real. And I was feeling the carpet under my toes and the cracks on the walls. It took me a while to figure out that I was not in my body until I walked through a wall. I couldn't figure it out.  <br>I've had experiences in other reality systems that are so beautiful—just so beautiful that the light is alive, and the color is living and engenders things like each color is an embodiment of some quality, and it speaks to you, and you can revel in it.  <br>Like, this one experience I had, I was just looking at the grass, and the grass was so green that I felt like I could look at this grass all day and not get bored because it's so beautiful and so rich. I could just look; I could just revel in the beauty of the green alone. But the whole environment was beautiful.  <br>I've also had some experiences where I've been able to interact with people that I know physically in this life who are alive right now, and I've had four experiences where I've been able to confirm that interaction the next day. I think that's a fun activity to try to do—interact with people and confirm it.  <br>But all in all, I mean, I'm a newbie when it comes to those types of experiences. They arise as they arise. I think that's something that's worth mentioning to anyone who's interested in this topic is that I found that in my case, meditation was the most powerful and helpful—I don't want to use the word "activity" because it's actually not an activity—but activity that I ever pursued.  <br>Because as you become increasingly familiar with what you really are—which is awareness itself—versus what you're not—which is your thoughts and your identification with form—and that's not really what you are—as you become increasingly familiar and in touch with the awareness that you really are, other parts of you will rise up to you on their own.  <br>So, out-of-body experiences just happen naturally because we aren't the body. It's not like a super rare, mystical thing when you begin to get in touch with the awareness that you really are, and then it becomes much more natural.  <br>So, I think that out-of-body experiences are incredibly fun, but I also have felt called to focus physically, so I have really been focusing on doing the mundane, day-to-day thing and doing what I can while I'm here. But when the experiences arise, that's wonderful. Embrace them.  <br>Luisa:<br>
Embrace them, yeah, and don't be afraid.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, and don't be afraid. That's the thing. These experiences can be extremely—I mean, they are extremely real, and they can be extremely fear-provoking because, like, the first time—so, the first non-physical experience I ever had after beginning to meditate, I was sleeping, and I was in a normal dream, and I was dreaming that I was about to be hit by a wave, and it was going to kill me.  <br>And this wave crashed into me, and I told myself in the dream, "Okay, you're dying now. Let go. Let go of your body." And as I thought that, suddenly I woke up, but my body wasn't awake, but I was awake, and I was experiencing the most loud—like a jet engine on either side of my head—and this vibration going through my whole body and my whole being that was so violent. It was just so extreme and so loud.  <br>And I was stuck there for I don't know—maybe 10 or 15 seconds—and when I woke up, I actually physically jumped out of my bed, and I was shaking. Yeah, it is—how could I know that? How is that experience possible? And so now, when an experience like that happens, I still strive to not react in fear—just allow what may happen.  <br>Luisa:<br>
That's great. And just briefly, you talked before about how, on this physical plane, we don't read each other's emotions—or not many of us read others' emotions. I think we actually do, but we kind of hide it or dull it. But I've also spoken to you about how you can feel people. Do you mind just discussing that briefly?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, I mean, I'll just say that, especially when I'm in a more meditated place—when I am not associated as deeply with the demands of earthly life—I tend to feel the nature of individuals that I interact with like in my body, like as a vibration.  <br>And I think, like you said, we don't really lose that because we really are consciousness. We really are connected. Separation is the illusion. Okay, so there really is still a connection, which means we really can still have telepathy. In fact, we are communicating with each other all the time, even if we're not consciously aware of it. All the information is there.  <br>So, the higher parts of us are always interacting anyway, but as we become more in touch with deeper parts of ourselves, it can be natural then to also experience parts of the other. Like, as just an example, I was in a gaming store one day, and I was playing a game on a table, and this old woman walked in.  <br>And I felt her all of a sudden, and I looked over, and my breath was kind of taken away because she looked physically like this meek old woman who was unexceptional—you know, very ordinary—but who she really was was powerful and profound and amazing. And I was just like, I wanted to just walk over and grab her by the shoulders and say, "Do you know who you are?"  <br>But I couldn't—that would be strange.  <br>Luisa:<br>
I want to be that guy.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, so I do feel that sometimes, you know, just at least to some extent. And I try to remain skeptical as well. You know, I'm a—I try to remain both open-minded and skeptical and just see what data is there. You know, there's another term—data. See what information, see what I'm experiencing, and just try to evaluate it.  <br>But yeah, I have found that I do experience things that other people do not. I've always been very sensitive. I'm sensitive both to physical stimulus and also non-physical stimulus. I can feel certain energies—like, if I hold a crystal, I can feel the difference.  <br>You know, I'm sensitive to smells and sounds and motion. You know, traveling can be very difficult for me when I'm going through a lot of different places very quickly. It's just a lot on my energy. I don't know. So yeah, that's part of my experience.  <br>Luisa:<br>
Well, it's very interesting. Thank you, Christian. It's been such a delight to have you on Passion Harvest. Is there something you'd like to talk to the Passion Harvest audience that I haven't asked since I've asked all the questions?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Sure, yeah. I just want to say to whoever's listening, I want to say that who you really are is so wonderful and profoundly beautiful and free and full of love that I want you to be encouraged—whoever you are listening—to not feel overwhelmed by all the circumstances of your life that you may be identifying with.  <br>What we are is far more than the human character. Who you are listening—you, the you that's listening—is you. And what I mean by that is you are the you that feels like you to you. You are the you that is most you that you know. And that precious you—just you may think that you are the problems, and you are the name, and you are the sex, and you are the body, but you are far more.  <br>And so, I'm honored and humbled to at least be able to remind you in some small part of that because, in who we really are, there's freedom, and there is ultimately nothing to fear. This is the place we come to experience here for the purposes I described earlier, but there is no true reason to ever be afraid. There is no true loss. There is no death. There is no actual defeat or failure.  <br>There is the experience of being human, the meaning that we place upon it, and there is such a rich opportunity in that. So, I hope to remind whoever you are listening that you are a powerful being and that you do not need to be afraid.  <br>Luisa:<br>
What a beautiful message, Christian. Thank you so much for spreading your light in the world. All your details will be in the show notes, but where's the best place for people to connect with you?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
I have a spiritual blog. It's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://www.awalkinthephysical.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://www.awalkinthephysical.com" target="_blank">www.awalkinthephysical.com</a>, and I'm also going to be publishing a book later this year.  <br>Luisa:<br>
Congratulations.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Thank you. I'm working on it, and anybody who would like to talk, I'm available on Facebook. Just look me up. I'm happy to speak to anybody who would like to speak.  <br>This is an awesome opportunity to be able to connect in the physical while we are here. We have all come a very long way, so it's my honor to speak to whoever here this day, this moment, because it's just an awesome thing that we've done to come this far. I'm honored to be able to do that, so please reach out if you'd like.  <br>Luisa:<br>

 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=LBTg7X1wJyM<br>23 OCT 2021<br><br><br>So, I just have to check that we're online. I'm just wondering if anyone can comment just to check that you can hear us. I think there's a little bit of a delay here. It still seems to be loading.<br>See, yeah, I see a notification online at least. Love from Cape Town! Yay! So, everyone can hear us. That's amazing.<br>Well, first of all, I want to say thank you so much for joining us on Passion Harvest. I'm so excited to introduce Christian Sundberg again on Passion Harvest. It's an absolute delight. Thank you all of you for being here.<br>Christian had a remarkable, or remembered, a remarkable experience—his pre-birth memories before this life. I'm not going to ask him to go into detail because I will put a link to his other interview. But we were just discussing that we'd like to talk about some of the fundamental importances of why we're here, really, and what does it feel like—that home feeling—and all about love.<br>But I'm going to open it up to Christian, and he has a new book as well, which is very exciting, that I'd like to discuss. I thought I'd let Christian speak to you for a while about what he feels is important for this live event. And again, thank you so much for joining us, and then we'll open it up to an audience Q&amp;A.<br>So, without further ado, welcome Christian Sundberg to Passion Harvest Live. I'm so honored and excited to have you on the show tonight—today, wherever you are in the world.<br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Thank you, Luisa. I'm happy to be here. Thank you for all the work that you do. It's very meaningful.<br><br><br>Okay, so yeah, I'm not going to go into great detail about my personal experience. I don't actually think it's that important. I think what's more important is that we spend the time we have to remind each other of what we're doing here—what this physical experience on Earth is all about.<br>As we go about our earthly lives, we tend to get really wrapped up in the forms and in the stories so much. It can help to have a moment of pause, like this one, to just take a moment to remind ourselves of what we know deep down that we may have forgotten. Of course, as we come to be human, we agree to forget a lot of what we really are, and that is a natural part of the play—the game of life.<br>We come to be these characters to have this experience from this vantage point. But I think it's very meaningful to remind each other, when we can, of what we really are. Because in what we really are, there is nothing to fear, and there is amazing power and joy.<br>So, I just want to speak to that at a high level in a general way. I hope that whoever is listening, if you can try to sense deep down—underneath all the repeating thoughts that seem to be so important in the day-to-day, underneath all the pain and all the things that you think are so important in your life that draw away your peace—I hope you can at least sense a little bit of what we're talking about here today.<br>Because it's bigger than words. It's bigger than thoughts. That's just something I'll disclaim very quickly. None of this can actually be said in language. It's just not possible because our higher natures transcend the world of form, the world of duality. Duality is not what we are. We experience duality.<br>So, it's quite impossible to take language from our world and try to describe these things. It's just not possible. But the deeper parts of us know. So, at a very high level, I just would like to say: whoever you are listening today, you are not just human. You're not just this character that you're playing right now.<br>The "you" that feels like you to you—the "you" that you most are—is who you really are. And that "you" is knowing the experience of being this person in this place. This experience is very dense and high contrast by comparison. It is also very, very high opportunity.<br>So, while we are not fully the human character, we are in a place where we can experience something that has incredible potential. And it's very important for us and powerful for us to focus on that potential rather than the fear—rather than all the self-perceptions that we seem to get wrapped up in that seem so real: perceptions of powerlessness or being unworthy of love, not having freedom.<br>These are some of the key perceptions that we deal with as humans on Earth. As we lose ourselves in those deep perceptions and then tell stories about it for years and years, we feel fear. But our fundamental nature never changes.<br>We are beings of love and joy and creativity and power and freedom. And that is what we really are. That is the true substance of spirit. It's the substance of life itself—with a capital "L"—and the living presence that you feel right now, this livingness in your body and in your mind, the alertness of your mind, is made of that very stuff—that very life, that very love and joy and peace.<br>Whereas the fear is not fundamentally real. It's something that we entertain for a while because we are engaging an experience of high contrast, high constraints that can provoke fear. But the fear doesn't ultimately have the power. What has the power is the life and the love that we really are.<br>And I think that is the single most important thing we can remind each other of—how we find that and feel that from here. Of course, it's very personal. We're all extremely unique souls, unique beings. We look at each other, and we see human physiology that looks quite similar, but in fact, each one of us is incredibly unique, has an incredibly different history, has incredibly different qualities and vibrational nature.<br>So, the way that we exchange and interact with the divine will be very unique. So, while I can't say it in a categorical way, I at least want to remind everybody to just sense a little bit about what we really are underneath this story.<br>So, I'm happy to entertain any questions. I'll do my best. I'm just an explorer like anybody else. I don't have all the answers, of course. And anyway, you don't need to listen to somebody external. Look within. Feel the spirit within your own connection to the divine, your own deeper knowing. Your higher self—the full you—knows and already knows. So, that's an important reminder too.<br>Luisa:<br>
Beautiful, beautiful messages there, Christian. You're such a ray of light, such a positive being. For those, whatever their situation, that may be struggling or suffering—whatever the causes are—what is your advice?<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Well, of course, that's very personal as well. There are so many ways we can suffer and struggle, and each person is so unique with how they meet that suffering and struggling.<br>But just one idea that is important that comes to mind that I'll raise up is that this reality, as firm as it is, is not our enemy. The experience we have here is not our enemy. It can feel like we live in a world of enemies and in a universe that may be cruel. But the universe is not cruel. It is simply firm, and it is a consistent context.<br>As consistent as the context is, that firm, that strong, is how your spirit can be refined through the application against that context—through choice-making through the context. So, the challenges of our lives are actually opportunities—really powerful opportunities.<br>And I know that's not easy to feel, but one of the main things we can do to then feel that is to try to accept, try to not fight and resist. Because it is in the labeling and in the resistance that the vast majority of our pain and suffering comes from—in rejecting the experience we're having and setting up friction with ourselves against it.<br>In fact, even when great pain arrives, if we can seek to just allow it and feel it and know it without a story, without a label, it's not truly deeper than you are. Put it that way. The consciousness that knows the pain is deeper than the pain that you might know. And you are deeper than the fear you might know.<br>So, I think that's an important thing to remember as we engage those fears. But just one comment—and there's so many things we could say about fear and how we meet it—but that's just one important thing to remember.<br>Luisa:<br>
Can I ask one or two more questions, and then we'll open it up to the course?<br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Of course, please.<br>Luisa:<br>
I know you spoke about this—that we definitely choose our life and quite possibly choose our events and experiences in our humanness. Is that your—how do you feel about that? Just exploring that briefly.<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yes, so we do choose our life context, and then we make free will choices in that context once we're here. In the pre-life review planning, at least the way I experienced it, I was aware of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold—or was very likely to unfold, or less likely to unfold.<br>And it is about knowing ahead of time what it will be like to be this person and to experience it from this perspective. Does that mean it's all pre-established? No. It's just that the system is super, super good at predicting outcome. It has all the information. It knows everybody very well.<br>But the variable is choice-making—free will choice-making within the context. So, while you don't have free will choice to choose any choice—you have to choose choices within the rules—but within the system's context, you are quite free to make whatever choice you wish. And so, that will affect how the life plays out.<br>So, we do review ahead of time, and then once we're here, we have total freedom to do what we will with the life. We're not bound as much as we think we are. There may be certain constraints that last for a lifetime. You might be born without a limb or something—that's a constraint that will last.<br>But generally speaking, we are far less limited than it seems on the surface, and we can choose and affect our lives in a very positive way as we go through the process. But yes, we do review ahead of time.<br><br><br>And from the perspective of the spirit pre-life, it's actually a super, super exciting opportunity—a super exciting opportunity to come and to be this, to have this extreme being. Human is like an extreme sport. It's like climbing Mount Everest or something. Not everybody wants to do that because it's really hard. It can be really hard.<br>It doesn't have to be really hard, but it can be really hard. Or maybe another analogy I like is going to outer space—putting on a spacesuit and going into a very hostile environment. That's a little bit metaphorically what it's like. And we do that because there's so much opportunity in this environment—opportunity that is not available in the far less constraining state.<br>So, we do review that and choose that ahead of time intentionally, even if we don't remember making that choice. And I know the human ego is very quick to not be okay with that because, "How? I would never sign up for this. This is hell. No way."<br>I understand. I'm not making light of it. But from the standpoint of the spirit that is not bound and knows its eternal power and its freedom and its immortality and the power of the love and the substance of what we are, it knows there's nothing truly to fear from that perspective.<br>It can be seen that this, even though this is highly constraining—and actually, perhaps even because it's highly constraining—there's so much opportunity here that we are honored, actually, to be given a chance to live a human life. It's an amazing honor.<br>Luisa:<br>
I really felt that in my heart just then. Thank you. One last question: in your opinion, is there an end goal to this—this cyclic returning to our humanness? Is there some finish line?<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Okay, so I feel that—personally—okay, so I personally feel that the human incarnation cycle, or not even just the human incarnation cycle, but the physical incarnation cycle into universes like this, does potentially have an end. It's not something that we would choose to necessarily do forever.<br>However, the process of evolution overall does not have an end. And that is because the expansion of love and joy is worth continually refining. This is really hard to put language on, but there is no—the soul has no limit in a sense. So, it will continuously and ever evolve and refine itself towards love, towards higher and higher states of refinement and perfection, you might say.<br>And the physical incarnation process—the whole cycle that we go through here, even thousands of lives—is just one course or something, one school, maybe one place that we can participate in that expansion. This is just a really extreme and specialized high-opportunity, high-speed, maybe you could say high-efficiency state—a place to come to participate in evolution in a very specific and powerful way.<br>Luisa:<br>
Yeah, that was well—thank you for explaining that. I'm just going to start reading the comments now. So, yeah, we're going to open it up to the Q&amp;A, but first, I want to say a big congratulations on your book, A Walk in the Physical. It's just, as you said, the response has been amazing. So, a huge, giant congratulations.<br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Thank you. And I just want to let everybody know that the book's available for free. It's not about money. If you go to my website at walkingtonthephysical.com, there's a book page. The third link down is a link to the Google Books entry where the whole book is available for free.<br>Thank you. I feel wonderful that it's physical. I knew for about six years that it just—I really felt as fresh or like it needed to be physical. So, I'm really happy that it is physical.<br>Luisa:<br>
Thank you again. Big congratulations. So, look at the comments. Hello, Shelly from Cape Town, and Roxanna, Catlight Sparkles. I'm just going down—there's a lot of people here. Mary, I love that name.<br>[Laughter]<br>Which one? All of them? The one with the sparkles and the names? Oh, Sparkles, yes. And Alan. Okay, first, Roxo says, "Christian, your video is one of my favorites on Passion Harvest. So interesting. Thank you."<br>Well, I'm saying thank you for Christian because he did all the work. I just have to ask him the questions. Okay, first question: Catlight Sparkles—oops, sorry, just skip down. See, I've got to get a bit more professional about this.<br><br><br>Dear Christian, I have a question. Could you please tell me what becomes of all the animals that are being abandoned, abused, and trapped in experimental labs and, gosh, factory farming, etc.?<br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, okay. So, first of all, I'm going to reread that for you. No, I—yeah, I understand. I think I understand. So, okay, so there's not—don't—I would encourage us not to think about the fundamental thing as being whether we are human or animal. Human or animal are just experiences that a being can have.<br>So, it's not like there's a fundamental distinction in the substance of what fundamentally is knowing being an animal and knowing being a human. From the human vantage point, we think humans are one thing, and animals are super different, and they must have some other thing. Well, really, we're not human either.<br>We're us, and we know the experience of being human or being something else. And not even just earthly context—I don't know much about this specifically, but I'm aware that there are other worlds, not just Earth. So, there's a lot of possibility of things that we can experience being.<br>It's just that each one offers a unique point of perspective, a unique cognitive experience. Being human is a highly specialized, unique cognitive point of perspective, and being an animal is a different kind of experience.<br>So, okay, so the thing is—okay, so even every experience has value. Every experience, even if a being comes and experiences only a very comparatively short physical experience, that still is very high value because this is such a rich and high-contrast state.<br>So, you know, even a baby who—or a being who experiences being a fetus in the womb and is never born—even that is so valuable. There's so much power and additiveness in even just that short experience. And, of course, being an animal is a highly valuable experience.<br>So, the pre-life selection process is—when that happens, the spirit is aware of what the life will likely be like. And if it is beneficial for the spirit to know that, to have that experience, they will then agree to have that experience.<br>So, that being said, I'm not—I am not in any way saying we should be okay with treating animals poorly. We should absolutely—love means all beings need to be accepted and loved and cared for and treated as a part of ourselves—all beings.<br>But also, in the pre-life, the spirit is aware of what this life will approximately be like. And if there is value to signing up for having that experience, they will. It is also possible—and this is going to sound probably a little strange—but nothing strange on Passion Harvest.<br>Okay, good. It's also possible for the system to play the character itself—like, in other words, not like an NPC, a non-player character. So, a bot—it looks like a body, looks like it's active, but there's no actual free-will awareness using the experience.<br>That's possible. I don't know how many times that happens. I'm just saying that if it's a particularly cruel situation, I just imagine it's possible that no one—I don't know. I mean, I think even the most difficult situations have so much potential that I think even they—you know, there will be a being that is interested in having that experience.<br>But I'm just saying it's also possible that no being has to necessarily use the experience of a given avatar. The avatars aren't fundamentally real. They're just characters that can be used.<br>Luisa:<br>
Very interesting. Another question from Mr. Bacon: "Mr. Bacon asks, do we choose—that's the conclusion, right? Do we choose our parents?"<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Okay, yes, we do. Okay, but in my case, my life intention preceded the knowledge of who my parents would be. I had an intention for what I wanted to experience and accomplish in this life, and then the guides brought to me a life packet—a life package.<br>I'm just calling it that. It's just this life that had so much potential in it that was a good match for what I wanted to do. And as I reviewed it, I did know very much who the parents were. In fact, I even have a memory of being aware of the parents when they first met, even though I wasn't born for some time until sometime after that.<br>But I remember reviewing the qualities of my parents—my mother and my father—and knowing that the way their natures would be really important for how they would likely raise me and how I would then grow up to have the strength and confidence necessary to meet the fear that I came to meet.<br>So, yes, we do review the parents ahead of time. In my case, it wasn't specifically primarily about the parents, but the parents made possible this very precious opportunity. They were absolutely integral to—I mean, think of how much work each person goes through in their whole life just to get to the point of being a parent, and then all the rigors of parenthood to raise a child.<br>Oh my gosh, it's such a humongous effort. And so, to—and that can be seen from the other side. And so, it's known, "Oh my goodness, if I could be the being that plays that character—that and like your parents from the other side—you know, they're like you. We have such a deep relationship with us all—like, so many souls. All the souls are connected to each other.<br>So, we know that they're not just this human—these couple humans. They are the beings who are playing these humans, and we have so much respect for those beings—not just the characters they're playing, but the beings that they really are that are knowing these characters. We have so much respect for them.<br>So, wow, they went through all this work to come to this point in their life, and now I get to be their child. Oh my goodness, that's very humbling and powerful. So, yes, we do get to choose our parents.<br>I know also that can be hard because I've had a lot of people that have made comments to me to the effect of, "But my parents were terrible to me. They were abusive. They were cruel." And I know that's quite common on Earth. And I'm not making light of that at all.<br>Sometimes the parents take their own fear path deeper than maybe was initially anticipated. But anyway, even those paths, we know there is incredible opportunity in it. We wouldn't be signing up for the experience unless there was a great meaning and an opportunity for us to have that experience unless there was a great meaning and an opportunity for us to have that experience.<br>Thank you, beautifully answered. I have a question from Gogo about the near-death experience.<br>Can Christian describe love on the other side and how the love is different from love on the earthly plane?<br>I think, yeah, it would be better to ask a near-death experiencer, but I do remember—I mean, I'm saying that very generally, of course. I just know near-death experiencers who are still very much actively, openly connected to it right now, whereas I'm still veiled. But I do remember the state of our total knowing and connectedness with everything and being one with each other.<br><br><br>There is no language that can possibly articulate the beauty, depth, and realness of the love that we really are. It's like the substance of life itself, and that substance is so deep, so colorful, so beautiful, so blissful, and churning with joy, possibility, and support. I just can't possibly put words on the depth of that.<br>That is what we naturally are. And that, times a thousand and more, is what's given to us freely. But then we come here.<br>Okay, so now here—this is a place where we are veiled. We feel separate from each other, which is a super alien state. Feeling separate and not connected—like we don’t consciously, usually, feel what the other person we’re with is feeling. We feel like, "I'm alone, I'm in this little box. No one else can feel me." We have our private thoughts. But there are no private thoughts. Everything is known, everything is seen.<br>Yet we feel like we have our own little private experience, looking out on a world of external objects. That is a unique situation for here on Earth. And part of that situation is precisely being veiled from that active, conscious knowing of the connectedness and our true nature.<br>Our true nature is that love. It's not like something that has to be given to us—it is the substance of being. The substance of being is overflowing and churning with love. It's like saying, "I don't know, the ocean is made of water." Love is— I don’t know, it’s a really poor metaphor, perhaps.<br><br><br>But here on Earth, we experience unique glimmers of that love in different forms. We use one word—"love." It’s just the closest word we can come up with, but it means far more than one emotion. It's far bigger than romantic love, familial love, friendship love. The Greeks had different words for every type of love, but there's even more than just that. Even the experience of beauty—like if you look at a sunset and feel connected to it—that is also a feeling of the love and the connectedness of what we are.<br>It is absolutely beyond description, and yet, yes, we do feel glimmers of it here. But I personally feel that it's quite rare, even here, to really find it in the earthly context. We are still connected there, so it is still possible for us to fully know it while we’re human. We’re not totally trapped here—it just feels like it. It feels like we’re, you know, we’re committed.<br>Our true nature is always connected. We can never not be what we really are. We are always a part of the whole—always, always. That deeper love is always just around the corner. It cannot be far. But on the conscious level of the human character, it’s quite common that we don’t feel that.<br>Of course, when we do feel it at the human level, it is like a dull, local reflection. I’m not speaking against the human experience—I’m just saying that what is possible here on Earth, by comparison, is quite muted in the way we might experience love. It’s still powerful, though.<br>One other thing I’ll say—so we’re so deeply incarnated here, right? If we can know love all the way out here and really make connections—loving relationships, parent to child, romantic love, friendship love, all the different kinds of love—if we really know that here, that is a powerful, powerful thing. It’s a powerful bond. Even though we might not feel it the same way we really know it there, the love is real. That connection is what we are already.<br>So when we love each other here, that love absolutely lasts. And while we might be physically separated—even if one person’s body dies and they are set free—that connection between the two individuals is absolutely strong and still there. That loving, powerful bond of love that we formed all the way out here in the dense physical is a very powerful bridge. A loving thought is like a trail or a bridge that they can follow back to us and be with us. That love is eternal. We have many more relationships than just what we remember on Earth.<br>I just wanted to make that comment because I don’t want to make it sound like love on Earth is somehow not important. Oh my gosh, it’s so important. It’s the substance of what we’re doing. So even though we might not feel it in the same breath, it’s so powerful and important when we can express love and know love here.<br>Thank you. This is a hard one.<br>I’m going to read it up. Kushal—were you shown anything about New Earth? Like how we will shift from 3D to 5D?<br><br><br>Okay, so I only have one memory about that topic. I'll simply say that I was aware that Earth is going through a very well-known awakening process. I’m not going to put any terms on that. I don’t know—I’ve heard the terms "3D," "5D," but I’m not sure exactly what they might entail specifically.<br>But I do know that Earth is going through an awakening process, and that is a raising of the vibration of the collective consciousness of this group. We are attempting a very exciting, difficult, relatively quick transition—awakening from very old fear-based thought patterns into a new, higher vibration state for the collective.<br>We’re in the process of doing that right now. It’s a high-friction process because we’re doing it relatively quickly. The density of the fear-based assumptions, beliefs, and content in our human collective consciousness is so dense. We have so much fear—we have thousands of years of history of "us versus them" thinking, of life being cheap, of living in a world where we literally eat the bodies of other creatures to sustain ourselves. It’s a really extreme environment.<br>So we have thousands of years of this deeply ingrained in our collective consciousness. It’s a rather mighty and ambitious thing that we’re doing—waking up to our true nature.<br>One thing I want to say about that that’s super important: it’s important that we do not become overwhelmed by the scope of the entire transition. No. You only need to think about yourself. Or rather, you only need to be aware of your own fear and develop yourself—work through your own fear and bring love into your own life. You don’t need to worry about the whole. You don’t need to worry about the entire state of the world.<br><br><br>If you meet your own fear, you are a part of the solution. Imagine the collective consciousness of humanity like a pond—a smaller body of water within the bigger ocean, but still its own thing. You are a part of that collective. That may sound like a fancy term, but it just means all of us involved in the human experience are part of one group in consciousness space.<br>And in that volume of consciousness, what even one person does affects the whole pond. If you meet your own experience, overcome your own fear, and bring love into your own life—even in the smallest way—you are affecting the entire whole. We tend to focus so much on the events on the surface—the political problems, people suffering. And yes, we should absolutely do our best to address those.<br>But it’s important not to lose ourselves in the extremity of the friction on the surface. What comes first is consciousness. Consciousness is first. The physical stuff is second.<br>So it’s an empowering message. This awakening that’s happening—we’re all part of it, whether we are aware of it or not. And there are a lot of non-physical guides who are part of it, too, trying to help us out.<br>But we do have a lot more power to contribute to it. And one other last comment I'll make is, I know a lot of people feel that they want a quick solution. You know, because look, Earth's got a lot of huge problems. Why don't I see the solution right now? Well, there's a lot of change happening. If you just look even to 30 years ago, think of how many things are different compared to 30 years ago. <br>But not only physically, vibrationally there is a huge difference. There's a... I can feel energy sometimes, and I feel that the energy of the collective has been increasing. It's quite noticeable. But it takes time, so don't be overwhelmed with the time scale. You know, even if it takes a few hundred years or something, that's not a big deal. We are timeless beings, and we're doing a rather ambitious thing here.  <br>So do today what you can do today, and you'll be doing a lot more than you think. I'm saying that do that rather than losing yourself in the "Oh my gosh, there's so much to fix." Well, then you lose your peace, and that's not as helpful. It's more helpful to know peace, know joy, and do your best to bring that into the world and into your own experience, into the people around you.  <br>Great, great. Thank you. I have a question from Mimi Taboo. Christian, how do prayers get heard by God on the other side?  <br><br><br>Yeah, so there is no distance. So it's not like they have to go anywhere physical. Consciousness is all connected to all consciousness. Imagine a huge ocean that's already one. It's already a part of itself. So if you are already an integral part of it, you are not actually separate from it. That's an important context because consciousness is the fundamental substrate, we could say. And the fundamental action that takes place is intent. That is, we wield an intention, and intent is always powerful. It always has an effect.  <br>In the physical, we don't see the effect right away sometimes. Sometimes we do. Most of the time, it's super slow, super dense. But our intention always has an effect. Prayer is the word we use for a dedicated, focused intention back toward the divine, back towards the source, or towards whatever form we name it. And that focused intention does have an effect. If we are more lukewarm, not focused in that intention, then it's not very effective comparatively. Though that still will have... everything, all intent, always has some effect.  <br>But meanwhile, if we are focused and genuine... and when I say genuine, I mean that authenticity of how we approach that prayer is key. It's not the action; it's who you really are. It's your true intent. What is your true intent? What are you truly intending and praying for? That true intention has an effect and is known. It's always seen. Every single thought that we have is seen and known, not just prayer. Prayer is just the word we use for when we set aside the time and intention to do that with some intention. And then the quality of the intention we bring into that activity is very powerful.  <br>I think that's the best way I can try to speak. Beautifully said. I'll move on. Red Robins also says, "Thank you for the book. I'm reading it now on Kindle." The question is, "How do we deal with the homesickness of... oh my goodness."  <br>Yeah, that's the question. That's a big one for you. That's my big question. I feel extremely homesick. Okay, so do you mind just sharing with the audience what we mean by homesick?  <br><br><br>Yeah, so homesick... if we have some awareness of where we really come from, then it can be super painful to be stuck here. We're not actually stuck here, but it can seem like it on the surface because the reality experience, this physical reality, is very consistent. Very effective at being consistent. You know, that's one property of the physical. It just stays firm. So because of that, when we're presented with that firmness and we can feel even just a little of what we really are, we yearn to be back in that freedom. We can yearn to be back in that freedom and to be back in knowing the full unity and the love of our true nature.  <br>Okay, so I'm not making light of that homesickness. It's one of the main reasons that we are veiled, in fact, because if we weren't veiled, the homesickness would be ridiculous. Okay, but so from my own case, I have made the powerful personal discovery that even that homesickness is an opportunity for growth. Because for so many years, I resisted it and rejected it, and I was pissed. Just being totally honest, I was just so angry at some level that I was stuck here and that I had to deal with... like when pain arose, sometimes I have periods of great pain, great physical or neurological pain in my life. When they arise, sometimes it's easy for my ego, of course, to rise up and say, "Screw this, I don't like this. I reject this."  <br>But that is an opportunity to surrender precisely to even that. Even the separation, even the pain, even the homesickness. When we can let go of our own ego response so much that we allow and accept even that we feel completely separate, even that we have pain that seems like it will not go anywhere... when we can fully allow and fully accept this experience as it arises to us, even knowing our higher nature to some degree, there is a profound growth, a profound freedom. And then once we fully accept, ironically, the boundary drops. Not because we tried to, not because we tried to get rid of it, but when we release fully and fully accept, the love and the peace and the joy of what we really are rises back up all on its own. Because it's what we always were. It was our resistance that caused the separation.  <br>You know, when we fight it and when we reject it through ego response, that is painful. But when we fully allow even that separation, it's powerful. I love the phrase... and this phrase really ticked me off when I first heard it. It was in my counselor's office years ago when I was getting EMDR therapy. At first, I remember being irritated by this phrase, but I have since discovered it's not just cute; it's extremely accurate. "Power lies in accepting powerlessness."  <br>So if we accept even the powerlessness of being veiled, being here, being physical, having a body that has limitation... wow, there is a lot of power in that. Where else can you do that other than here? And later, when we're done, we can share and say, "You remember what I did? I did this." And you share it telepathically with another being. And if it's a being who hasn't been veiled and physical, they may say, "How? That's not even possible. How did you possibly do that? Unbelievable that you came, that you did that, and that you even came to terms with it. Oh my goodness." Well, here you are. Here's the opportunity right now to do that.  <br>Thank you for sharing that, Christian. You're answering the questions amazingly, and we're getting so many good questions from the Trash and Harvest family. Thank you so much. Another one from Mr. Bacon: "Can I refuse taking the honor of returning to Earth again?"  <br><br><br>Yes, absolutely. But the thing is... so I've had that thought many times. I know you have. I admit, however, I also am aware that I am not at the vantage point right now that I can see clearly. So my ego is my ego that says, "I'm never doing this again." I very well may decide not to. I don't know. But I can't make the decision now. The part of us that makes that decision is the part of us that's rejecting the difficulty.  <br>I'm not making light of that at all. Yeah, but yes, it is up to you. So if you are on the other side... so from the other side's vantage point, we have no limitation, but we also know exactly what we've been. It's not like we're deluded, and that's why we sign up. No, we have full knowledge. But we have full knowledge of what we really are too, which is so much deeper, so much bigger, so much greater. And we see very importantly how much growth potential there is in the physical experience. It is off the charts. And the quality of the refinement of our being that we can accomplish here is off the charts.  <br>So from that vantage point, you will get to decide: Would you like to go another round or not? It is your choice, absolutely. And it has to be your choice. I feel it has to be your choice because the spirit is sovereign. What I mean is, you're a part of Source at the deepest level. The soul is sovereign. So how can it lose its power and be veiled other than to surrender it itself? And that is what the veiling is. It's a process of surrendering your own... like letting a cloak onto you and into you that limits you. And the only way that can work is if you give it permission and surrender because you're sovereign.  <br>So yes, you will get a choice, and you're allowed to choose anything you want. There's no problem either way. It's completely up to you. You'll just be able to see a lot clearer, more clearly.  <br>Yeah, we do keep choosing, though. This is a question from Gruesman: "Can a soul be older than the Earth?"  <br><br><br>Absolutely. Okay, so but linear time is not a fundamental thing. So it's just a construct. It's an artificial creation of a very strict sequence. So do we precede that sequence? Absolutely.  <br>I had an experience very early in the universe. I remember being non-physical and sailing through this universe and being super, super, super excited about it. That was... I don't know exactly the date or something. I know the Earth is like, what, 10 billion out of 15 billion years old? I don't know when it was, but it was so early that surely it preceded a usable Earth. But that because our true nature is ancient, it precedes all of this anyway. And then it uses it as a valuable, limited experience. Linear time itself and discrete location itself, those two things are related. They are transcended by the spirit fully. Those are just like local video game constraints or something that we sign up for for a while.  <br>God, I just love how you answered that. That was my favorite one so far.  <br>Rachel J: "Hi, Christian and Louisa. Is there any part of you that is unsure that we go on after we physically die?"  <br>No, not for me. Not for me either. That's... no, I'm absolutely certain. I have no doubt. However, I do fear. I do have fear. So I am afraid of the dying process. But I... and I don't mean this in a negative way, only a positive way... I yearn for that. I mean, I yearn to be free. I don't... I'm not forsaking this opportunity because I'm very careful with how I think about that because I know this is an opportunity. I'm not going to actualize my own demise if I can help it. I'm just saying that when death comes, I'll be ridiculously happy and excited.  <br>And no, I have no doubt. Okay, well, that kind of segues into this next question. I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing your name incorrectly, Winty. "Some talk about the light being a trap. Does Christian think we can be fully trapped or misled after we pass over? Or can we then tap into so much knowing, truth, and clarity that this isn't possible?"  <br><br><br>Yeah, that's a really good question. Okay, well, first of all, I'll just say that there are other reality systems where untruth is possible as a general comment. In systems where we are similarly veiled or veiled to some extent and where we are in a system of limited information and where fear-based choice-making can happen, deception can arise from that. It's possible for there to be a form of deception in some other realities.  <br>However, I definitely feel that the light is not a deception. The light is the true light of being. It transcends all of the limitations of Earth. But what we do on Earth... I'm not making light of this question, but what we do... no pun on words by the way... yeah, no final words. So but what we do on Earth is we... we live in an extreme duality right now. And we live in a world where deception is almost a daily occurrence. Like, my spam email box right now is probably full of 50 phishing scams trying to get my personal information to steal my money. You know, like, we all... I'm just like, it's commonplace that there's deception on Earth.  <br>And we live in a world where there's even things like killing other creatures and death, and there's all these deep, deep, deep, deep themes that we've worked with for thousands of years. Deception and the power of other beings over us is a common theme on Earth. So what we do is then we take those themes and we apply them up the ladder. We're afraid, so we think, "What if that is a trick? Because I hurt on Earth. This incarnation thing sucks. I don't want to do this anymore. This must be a trap." And then we apply it up the ladder.  <br>However, it is a duality-conditioned belief that we learned locally. And our true nature fully transcends all duality. Our higher self is in a state of total knowing. There is no deeper... like, thing that can be false. That there is only the connectedness and the knowing and the fullness and the joy of what we are.  <br>And so from the human vantage point, I've heard this belief before. I feel it's a really good example of human Earth-based, fear-based thinking that we then kind of enshrine. I mean, just that just the general belief that the reincarnation cycle is a trap. Now, it is possible. I will say that there is such a thing as beings who reincarnate and then reincarnate, and they get pretty well... how do I describe it? Not addicted... we'll just say their terminal velocity is low. You know, like, they're... let's say, like, I don't know, maybe like orbiting a planet or something, and they just keep going around because they haven't... they're really sticky.  <br>Because the Earth experience is so dense and so stimulating. Like, being human is so dense, so stimulating. It's like, wow. Or not just human, but any physical experience. So when we're free from that, there are many beings who immediately... wow, I know there's another thing I want to experience. There's nothing I'm going to do. And it can be almost routine or... these are really bad words because I really don't want to limit it. I'm just saying that it's... it's possible for someone to kind of not be stuck but be in a pattern of a reincarnation cycle.  <br>However, that's not our true nature. And as we evolve and as we grow, freedom is our natural state. So eventually, one way or the other, we're going to work... we will be free of even this cycle. It's kind of like... how about this? How about like you play a video game, and it's stimulating and kind of addictive, and then you come back a few hours later, and all you can think about is doing the game again? I mean, this isn't a great metaphor, but then you play it again, and then you play, you know, and you do it enough times, eventually it's like, "You know what? That was really stimulating and fun, but I'm not going to do that anymore now." That's empty. It doesn't really have any true substance to it. Maybe a little bit like that.  <br>In that, we tend to get addicted. So we get addicted not just to the experience; we get addicted to thinking. Like, even right now, we get addicted to our own thinking or thoughts. Human thoughts are very dense, stimulating. Wow, wow, think. Wow, that thought was stimulating. Wow, that thought was stimulating. That was stimulating. That's one of the reasons that meditation is so powerful because it's like de-addicting yourself to the drug of thinking. It's like stepping back and allowing yourself to know your deeper, more refined nature. And that can be helpful.  <br>So anyway, but in that whole thing, I just want to highlight: There's nothing to fear. You're not stuck. We are never stuck. We do always have free will. It's just that there's a lot of attraction to experience that is this dense because of the potential that it offers. It's all about the potential and the growth that can occur on Earth that is difficult to occur elsewhere.  <br>Great. Next question from Mike Hope Park Junction: "I find the fact of not recalling previous lives and having no memory of between lives when we get to know our true selves very difficult. Do we ever get to know who we truly are?"  <br><br><br>Yes, oh, absolutely. Okay, so the higher self can play a number of characters. And that's just that means you, who you really are, are not just this character. Your other characters too. But it's not different people. It's you. Same you, same exact you, just knowing different experiences. And at the deepest level, yes, that higher you, that is you, can and will know the breadth of all that you are.  <br>It's also possible for the higher you to play one character for a while and let that character go off and develop on its own for the purposes of expansion. And so from the perspective of that one character, it may seem like the other characters are not consciously available, at least for a time.  <br>It is possible, for example, for some personalities to continue the experience of that personality after the death of the physical body, whereas others may not do that. I don't know a lot about that, but I know there are astral locations where some beings who are very accustomed to Earth will go and experience an Earth-like environment for a while as their human personality as a form of transition.  <br>But it's also possible to go directly to the state of, "Oh, I'm not the character. I'm all my characters." And you don't need to die to do that either, by the way. You know, you're the deepest being that you are. It's you. It's these characters. And I experienced one time after I meditated, I suddenly became aware of hundreds of other lives that I had. That I was like... it wasn't other beings. It was me. Than me. That feels like me to me. Just did all these other many other things, and they're a part of me. And the strengths and qualities of those characters are a part of me too. Like, it's all part of it. It's all part of me.  <br>So yes, we can definitely reach a place where we know the totality of what we are. And simultaneously, we also might have experiences for some short or long durations where we feel like one specific character intentionally. But that character is always a part of the whole.  <br>Okay. Thank you. Hello, Carol Richardson. Her message for Christian: "Do we choose experiences that play out what we delivered to others? I'm assuming this is a bit like a comic in a previous life so that we feel what others felt but in human form rather than a life review."  <br>Well, I read that again: "Do we choose experiences that play out what we delivered to others?" Okay, yeah, no, I understand. <br><br><br>So the simplest way to say it is yes. But it's not that we're bound like we have to experience a certain thing because as a punishment or something. It's not a punishment. It's that we are who we are.  <br>Okay, so if we go into an experience and we act in fear and hurt somebody, and then through the life review, we become aware, "Oh, I have that much fear. I have that much ego. I did that." That's a part of you. That's who you are. So it's not that you are required to go experience that same pain. It's not about the pain. It's about re-fleshing out and filling out and refining out into your own shortcomings.  <br>And so yes, it's not about punishment. It's about there are areas of growth that are optimal that we choose to sign up for because we see that we have a weak spot there. Like, in this life, I am walking on my weak leg. Like, I have a deep fear that overcame me in the past. I was a super unhelpful, mean person in one of my lives. And so I'm here dealing with that same pain now, even though I didn't do those things in this life. It's a part of me. And it's okay because I'm responsible for it, whether it's then or now. There's not a big difference.  <br>I mean, to a human personality, it feels like, "Oh, wow, a different lifetime. That's a big deal." It's not really a big deal. It's just same you, just knowing a different experience. It's still a part of you. So that means now, right now, any now, is the key moment that we can choose to meet and process even those shortcomings. We can own our own crap. And if we can honor our crap now, we process it. We don't do it just to escape the karma cycle. It's again not about punishment.  <br>We do it because we expand and we grow in that way. And once we expand and grow, that's wonderful and beautiful. You know, it's not that we have to do that. It's that we want to grow towards love. And you know, there are patterns within us that might follow us from experience to experience as we do that.  <br>Thanks, Christian. I've got a message from Unrelated. They say, "I have a question. This is complicated. I have a question. Isn't using a human incarnation/ego to further the soul's growth a bit like animal testing? Like an ends justify the means? The means permit an ends."  <br><br><br>Okay, the question is a little bit like asking, "Is lifting weights that terrible act of lifting weights, that terrible thing? Is lifting those terrible heavy weights is that worth doing? Like, why would we ever do that?"  <br>I mean, I also don't like this metaphor because that makes it sound like we only do it for the product of our experience. The experience itself is additive. So in this metaphor, lifting the weight is an additive function immediately. Immediately, the moment we are experiencing it is additive because all that is with a capital A can expand and become more as discrete experience is known.  <br>And that process is one we sign up for, not just for personal expansion but because we are performing a service by knowing this and not that for a time, even potentially painful this and not that. It's not that the pain is good. It is not that the pain is good. Pain is not even necessary technically. It's just that in knowing discrete experience, we are participating in a creative process. And we are creative beings, and so we love to do that. We love to expand in that way.  <br>And every way that we experience lack and even desire... you know, every hole that we dig that isn't filled while we're human can and will then ultimately be filled because now we know exactly what it's like to have that hole, to have that missing thing. And now forever, our true nature can fill it and know it forever. And that is a... in that way, contrast is a useful additive tool, not a curse, not just a means to an end but also it has a purpose. It does have an end to it.  <br>So I hope that answers the question. It's very hard to speak about that from here because the human ego, which is in duality, sees things in a very from A to B thing way. You know, that is how we see things on Earth. You know, we light a match, we get flame, we get flame, we can light a fire, the fire can burn the chicken, whatever. You know, whatever. Like, we think all of reality is like that. But our entire system of duality and contrast arises within that which transcends it fully. It fully transcends it. It just uses it almost...  <br>I don't want to use the word "experiment" in the way that the question used the word "experiments." It sounds very negative. But it is a creative experiment in the way that like we're deeply curious, and we're deeply creative. And because we're so curious and so creative and so powerful, we will do even this. And it's okay that we do it. It's wonderful that we do it, in fact.  <br>I'm not saying that means it's easy. This is the place where it can be hard. Like, really hard. So hard that many people... and again, I am not making light of this... many people will become so overwhelmed that they will literally kill their own bodies even today. That's how overwhelming this contrast on this world can be interpreted and experienced.  <br>I'm not making light of that. I'm just saying that to the degree that it is that challenging, it is even more creative and useful if we allow it to be. Thanks. I'm sorry if that's not satisfying to the ego.  <br>No, you expressed that really well. Are you like... there's no way to answer that question in words. There's just no way.  <br>I have a question from Rachel J: "I have a hard time with the fact that I chose my parents. They're both narcissistic and not nice or nurturing in any way."  <br>Yeah, I know you touched on that briefly. Yeah, so now that you're here, what will you do today? You know, we tend to think that these things we have to do in life and accomplish in life are really, really big. It's not about moving big mountains around. It's about how we meet exactly our experience today.  <br>It is extremely challenging to operate successfully in the world and to find the love and joy when you have been abused or when your parents are narcissistic. Your very conditioning then is from that. That's hard. And that is very admirable that you then now choose the love that you do from the context that you're in. Your guides see it, know it, they support you and love you. You may feel alone in it, but you're not. You're actually admired for a while.  <br>Now that you're in this context, what do you do with it? And it may seem like some small thing you do. Maybe it's forgiving them in some way or maybe it's expressing yourself and standing up for yourself in some way that you never had the courage to before. Or maybe it's ending that cycle with your own children. You know, stopping that narcissism and recognizing in yourself the patterns your parents passed on to you and saying, "You know what? I'm going to stop that, and I'm going to try to treat my kid better in a certain way."  <br>Whatever way we can actualize the love that we really are... oh, that's powerful. And so the context that you have, try to see it as not just terrible. It's an opportunity. It's a context that you now get to do something with. And that is amazing.  <br>So in the meantime, I'm sorry to hear that. And I don't... also, I just say, try to feel deep down who you really are because narcissistic parents tend to make you really be conditioned to believe you're not worthy of love or you're not free or you're not powerful. The main things that we wrap ourselves up with as human... all those are completely contrary to the true nature of what we are. We are free and powerful and worthy of love.  <br>So I hope that maybe even just now, even if just now, try to feel that somewhere deep down in there for a moment. And that's very powerful.  <br>Thanks, Christian. Are you okay with a few more questions?  <br>Yeah, of course.  <br><br><br>Most Serene One: "Are ghosts or souls which do not cross over real?"  <br>Yeah, so I don't personally have a lot of experience with this topic, but I'll at least share my opinion. So I think that there's two things going on when we talk about ghosts. I think most of the time, what's happening is thought momentum in the... okay, so our thinking has momentum and creates... we'll call objects in the astral and higher in the realm above ours that's thought-responsive. Our thinking, our thoughts, our beliefs create things. Thoughts are things.  <br>And so when millions and millions of people, as an example, believe in something, it gets a strong thought form and then has kind of a life of its own, even though it's not a free-willed thing. It's like a pattern of energy that can kind of act in a way. Like, for instance, the belief in something like Satan as an example. You know, there's a lot of belief, a lot of momentum to it.  <br>Okay, so now as for ghosts, even one person's very strong emotional experience can set into motion a thought form. And that thought form, if powerful enough, can be perceived in some physical ways, you know, whether it be in visual or audio ways. So there might be a place like a house or something where someone had a strong emotion or something, and they set into motion a thought form, and now it's just repeating until it eventually might lose energy.  <br>I don't know. I mean, I don't know about how that works. I just think that thought forms are a big part of what we experience. Also, another... a lot of people, you know, when they talk about having like an experience with a demonic being or something, that's also an example many times of fear-based thought forms that are just playing out.  <br>Okay, but is it possible for souls to be trapped? I don't like the word "trapped" ever because we are never, ever, ever trapped. However, it is possible to become so deeply associated with form and with the Earth or with some activity that we tend to stay focused on it for a while, whether it be locally here or whether it be in a non-physical environment that's Earth-like for a time.  <br>Eventually, we'll all find our way back. And sometimes a guide will even just come and give us a little reminder, like, "Focus upward." You know, and as soon as we do that focusing and we call out to the divine or whatever form, we immediately reconnect because that's who we really are.  <br>So I think it is possible for a free-willed being to focus for a time on the physical or on an experience like the physical. But I would never say that we're trapped. Now, I will say that fear can feel trapping. And that is true whether you're physical or whether you have a deep being-level fear that maybe you've taken with you, you haven't resolved yet.  <br><br><br>Fear is, by its definition, a distance away. It's an experiential distance further and further away because it's being wrapped up within a perception that is not in alignment with the truth. So by wrapping up in that perception, it creates a distance. And so many of us over our entire lives, even, will experience a fear that can create a distance. And that's what feels like being trapped.  <br>And it is possible for a fear not to be resolved in a given experience. But even then, that's not the true nature of what we are. Our true nature is the substance of life itself, spirit itself. And when we then let go and return to that true nature, there is no reason to fear. Fear is only possible when we don't know who we really are.  <br>It's only when we're lost in the identity of something that seems not in alignment with the truth that we feel that fear. And so you could say, you know, the simulation is not fundamentally real. It's only when we lose ourselves in the simulation that we experience that fear. And since it's not fundamentally real, we will all return to the higher nature that we are.  <br>Great. Thank you. When we lose ourselves... beautiful, beautiful.  <br>A question from Theto: "I had a miscarriage at 23 weeks. Does that soul live on?"  <br><br><br>I shared in my pre-birth experience how I caused a miscarriage the first time, the life immediately preceding this one, because when I arrived, I was so overcome by the fear of being separate and veiled that I rejected it and fought my way out. And in my case, at least, I am responsible... not was in the past tense, but right now, I am responsible for that for causing that pain to the mother. And I knew how my fear had affected not only the mother but hundreds of other people who are negatively affected by the mother.  <br>So if a being chose to incarnate and be physical for a while, absolutely, that being experiences it. And then if it moves on, that connection is still very real. The relationship between a mother and a child is a powerful, loving bond. And it doesn't matter when that bond might physically... I mean, it doesn't matter when there might be a physical cessation. The bond endures because love and love is what we are.  <br>In fact, some near-death experiencers who lost children young report meeting those children in a more grown-up state in some non-physical reality system because they've continued on even though they had only a very short time on Earth. And that, I think, is pretty common. I also think it's possible that the system would see the pregnancy situation and if it knows that it's certain that the avatar is not going to be available... just, you know, put it in blunt terms... it won't be assigned. You know, there's no need to have an incarnation happen. But if it is useful to be there for some being, even for like a day, then an incarnation could be selected.  <br>I don't know how that all works. It's quite a complex system, and the guides are masters at figuring all that out. But I just know that even that experience is valuable. And yes, that connection does remain if a being did use that experience.  <br>Thank you.  <br>A question from AGC: "Do you think we can talk to people alive or dead on a spirit level in meditation?"  <br>Absolutely. Now, we're all connected all the time. So focusing an intent towards that person, there is a connection. Whether or not you can perceive their response is another matter. You know, of course, it's easy for the human on the human level for our imaginations to get involved, and we start imagining things that aren't necessarily really coming from outside of us.  <br><br><br>But yes, we have that connection. It is a lasting, real connection. The distance, though, is not physical. It's vibrational. Okay, so like... if this is super crude, I'm just using a metaphor... but if Source is here, and we're all the way over here, you know, maybe they're in some... this is so dualistic. I kind of hate the metaphor, but if they're like in the middle or something, where there is a vibrational distance that is not too great, and that there can be a meeting, then yes, communication can occur.  <br>And that's why a lot of channelers or mediums who are truly channeling or truly doing mediumship... they have to be very high vibration. You know, they need to really rise up, and then the friends or the guys on the non-physical need to come down, and it has to be this meeting in the middle somewhere.  <br>And sometimes also, that's why, by the way, some people will say that after a loved one passes, they have an experience where that person communicates to them, maybe even months later, maybe when they're in the shower or when they're like listening to the radio. Their guard is down. They're not thinking the negative thoughts. They're open. They're receptive. Their vibration is open and high. And so there's this window through which a message can be sent because now that person is at a state that has more matching vibration for that connection to be made.  <br>So yes, it is possible.  <br>Gosh, there's so many questions, but I'll just skim through a few. Actually, having... yeah, some about channeling and things.  <br>Cat Likes Light Sparkles: "Again, a great question. If a person is living... this probably relates to a lot of the Passion Harvest audience to some extent... if a person is living a life alone and disconnected from family and has really no friends, is this person still connected to those that they are estranged from?"  <br>Absolutely. Absolutely. There's no physical distance. There's only the apparent experience of physical distance. You're connected not only to the people that you feel estranged from but to the entire human race and to all the non-physical friends that know you. Beings that you've forgotten you have. We all have very, very close friends and family that we don't even remember while we're on Earth. We're connected to them too.  <br><br><br>So there is no such thing as truly being alone. The only way that we can be alone is when we look around us and don't see visual stimulus that shows bodies. And then we buy into that because, "Look, there's no bodies around me." I'm not making light of that. I'm just trying to highlight that we associate so deeply with our physical stimulus. We think that's it. But the consciousness that we are, the very field of the living awareness that is our body and that we feel as our body and that is the alert awareness right now... that very same awareness is integrally connected to all other beings and the whole.  <br>And so yes, we are absolutely connected to those that we may feel estranged from for a time.  <br>Thank you. Um, just a question from Rachel J. Do we keep a memory bank when we go back from our last life? I'm assuming when we return to the non-physical realms.<br>Yes, yeah, all data is retained. Tom Campbell likes to call it a database. Many people call it the Akashic Records. But it's not just an external record; it's all experience that is valuable.<br>Now, the soul won't be beholding all experience at all times. You know, like right now, we're not experiencing everything that we are; we're having a very unique, refined, focused experience. So, in this moment, we may not be aware of other things that are a part of us, but the data is all there. Yeah, every experience is precious to the soul, so it doesn't throw it away.<br>Um, you know, there may be some things that are not as meaningful to us, but we assign the meaning. Right? So what's meaningful to us, and all the other data, in fact, is retained. It's useful to have that, and it can be reviewed if we so desire.<br>Um, I'm just reading all the comments, and I can't name everyone, but I just want to say there's lots of thank yous, and Christian, you're one of my favorite people, and so many compliments.<br>I think we might almost finish it there, but I just want to say thank you so much to Christian Sundberg for being on Passion Harvest and the incredible audience that has come out today, tonight, this morning, wherever you are in the world.<br>But I always like to ask my guest, Christian, it's your platform today. So, God, you're an absolute wealth of information, but is there something you'd like to share with the Passion Harvest audience?<br>But first, your book: please go to Christian's website. I'll leave a link below in the show notes, and you can download his incredible book.<br>So, Christian, I'll leave it up to you to share whatever message you'd like to, on a final note, with the audience.<br>Yeah, okay. So instead of more words, since we've said many words, and I think I opened with the most important message I could say, um, let's just take a moment to connect. Our intention, our energy, doesn't need to be physically spoken at all times. Just put aside all the crap out of fear and all the labels for a moment and feel our connectedness to each other.<br>We are brothers and sisters, all of us, even people who listen to this after the fact. Feel within you the connection.<br>I give thanks to all spirit for this opportunity and for everyone. Thank you very much for the honor, and thank you for the support.<br>And Lorisa, thank you very much for the opportunity today. Uh, it's always wonderful to discuss these things while we're in the physical.<br>You know, everybody who listens today has come a very long way. We've all taken very long journeys to be here at this moment, to connect in this way.<br>And so, I hope that everybody who goes from this remembers the preciousness that you are and the value of this day and is able to approach life with a little less fear today. Sense that joy and the peace of who you are and go do something fun and enjoy the day.<br>Yay, what about, yeah.<br>I feel like standing up and applauding, but then you won't see me. Um, thank you so much to the Passion Harvest family, the Passion Harvest audience, wherever you're watching, and a big thank you to you, Christian, for all that you do.<br>Thank you so much.<br>Thank you to everybody who is human today with us. It's an awesome thing.<br>So, thank you.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2021/pre-birth-experience-live-interview-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2021/PRE-BIRTH EXPERIENCE - LIVE Interview with Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:03:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pre-Birth Memories, NDEs, and Consciousness]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Pre-Birth Memories, NDEs, and Consciousness<br>
youtube.com/watch?v=8BVmoUfVJHY<br>20 AUG 2021<br><br><br>And now, from beyond our dimension, this is the Jeff Mara Podcast. Here's Jeff.  <br>Today's guest is Christian Sundberg. At the age of 30, Christian took up a meditation practice and went through a personal awakening journey as he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. During that time, he also began to have out-of-body experiences. Today, we're going to talk about that.  <br>Christian, thank you so much for joining us and welcome.  <br>Thank you. It's an honor to be here, Jeff. I appreciate it.  <br>If you don't mind, can we just start when you took up the meditation practice? Can you give us a little background on how you started having these pre-birth memories?  <br>Yeah, sure. So, my body is 41 years old right now. 11 years ago, at about the age of 30, I took up a long-term meditation practice because I began to follow the work of the physicist and consciousness explorer Tom Campbell. At first, it was just an intellectual process. I was just reading his book, watching his videos, and learning. But he recommended that the individual pursue meditation as a form of investigation.  <br>So, I didn't have any expectation. I just began meditating every day. After a few months, I began to have non-physical experiences, out-of-body experiences. The first time I had one, it was very shocking and eye-opening. My worldview quickly changed.  <br>Not long after that, I began to have memories return to me of a time that I existed before my human life here. This memory I recalled was something that I knew when I was young, before the age of six, but I had forgotten it after the age of six. So, all of my adult life, I did not have that memory. But now that it's returned, it's quite something that's on my mind every day because it's so real and in my face and integral to what I'm doing here.  <br><br><br>First thing I'd like to know is, can you tell me about the meditation practice that you were doing? Is there a specific format of the meditation?  <br>Yeah, so Tom Campbell has an exercise in his book which could be loosely described as transcendental meditation. But the form of the meditation I found is not particularly important. We like to think about form, about what words or what process we're using. So, we can call it transcendental meditation, but the important thing was that I gained the ability to control my focus and I gained increasing familiarity with my awareness itself beneath thought.  <br>As that began to occur, larger parts of myself began to rise up on their own. So, if you wish, I can share just a brief summary of my rebirth experience if you'd like, and then we can probably speak more about the meditation.  <br>Sure, yeah. So, okay, just as a very quick disclaimer, these things cannot be spoken about with language. I'm aware that your audience probably already knows this. I just have to say for those who may be listening that our true nature transcends form. It transcends the world of duality and the world of dense distinction that we experience here as humans.  <br>The words we use in the human context are vastly insufficient to speak to who we truly are. The higher realms are our true nature. It just cannot be articulated. Okay, so that being said, I remember a very long time ago—and again, time is really hard to speak about too because while these memories do have a sequence, they're all happening at once, and they transcend the linear time that we experience commonly here on Earth.  <br>Okay, but I remember engaging this being long ago before I had any physical incarnations at all. When I came across this being, I felt from him this incredible freedom, power, and beauty in his nature and who he was, what he had become. The nature of the being that he was, and I was deeply inspired by what I felt from him.  <br>I asked him—and again, this isn't words, it's telepathic—I asked him, "My goodness, how did you get to be this? How did you become this?" And he shared with me that he had lived physical lives. He shared with me one in particular in which he had suffered. He had been sick or had some kind of physical painful ailment that lasted for many years, a long time.  <br>The way in which he met that experience had a profound impact on who he was, on his nature, on his essence. It allowed a refinement and a growth towards love and freedom that was just unspeakably beautiful and powerful. So, I said, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I will do that."  <br>He kind of at first almost playfully brushed me off like, "Yeah, that's what they all say. It's hard in a way that you don't know that you've never known before." But I was persistent. I said, "No, I really mean it. I want to do this." And he said, "Well, go talk to your guides."  <br><br><br>So, I did, and I lived many lives since then. The majority of this memory that I have is of a time immediately preceding this human life where I had taken a long break after previous incarnations. After taking a long break, I remember this guy coming to me while I was resting, so to speak. I was in this realm of gold, and I was full of freedom, joy, and bliss.  <br>But this guy came to me and occasionally asked, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And I just kept putting him off for a while, and eventually said, "Okay, I'm ready."  <br>Then, I reviewed with this guide what I can only describe as my state—who I was, who I had been, what I had done. It was very clear in this review what I needed to do, what I needed to work on, so to speak. I don't really like the word "work on." What I needed to experience and grow through.  <br>The best English word we can use is that it was a fear. It was a very low-vibration experience that had bested me in a previous experience. So, I very much wanted to re-engage that because I knew that if I could do that, there would be an absolutely incredible growth permitted—a growth of being, a growth of the bliss and joy of being. And that I would be serving not only myself but I would be serving the whole.  <br>If I could do this, if I could meet this experience, I was extremely excited at the opportunity, at the thought of doing this, even though I knew it would be very challenging. Eventually, they brought me a life for that purpose. I reviewed that life and I accepted that life.  <br>I accepted the veil. The veil is just a word, but it is the constraints and consciousness space that we agreed to adopt in order to have a physical experience. It's very hard to explain or describe, but it feels like, at least for me, it felt like an amplifier that produces a pitch against a tone, like a vibration.  <br>When you accept the veil, it's like diving deep down, down, down, and having your true being obscured. That pitch just drops down drastically. Once you get to the bottom, keep turning it down and then turn it down some more, and then more and more and more. Keep going and then turn it down some more. That's how it felt to come all the way down to this physical vantage point.  <br>I knew that each physical lifetime was like a vibrational vantage point that we could arrive at, and this one was very low vibration, very dark. I really immediately resisted the feeling of not remembering all of who I really was and feeling cut off from my true nature. I felt like I had lost everything that I am.  <br>So, I immediately responded in fear in this life. I was still in the womb at this point. I had not been born yet, but I summoned my might and I smoked the veil. I fought my way out. I pushed my way out past it and inadvertently then had killed the fetus. I had killed the body that was to be mine.  <br>I had a life review for this very short life. I don't know how long I was there, but it was super short. In this life review, I knew that I had affected the mother in a very negative way. I had heaped sorrow on her and not only on her but on hundreds of other people that would be negatively impacted by the mother.  <br>So, I had great intentions going in, but my fear was so great that I did not succeed. From that side, you know that all is well and it's okay. You can't truly fail, but I also very objectively knew, "Wow, I could do better than that. I really have a lot of fear. I got to work on that."  <br><br><br>So, that life opportunity was wasted. Then, they brought me this life. This life was not as optimal as that life would have been. It wasn't bad. It was still pretty good, but it wasn't as perfect as the other one would have been. But it still had a lot of potential.  <br>I remember reviewing this life in vast detail. I describe it like a flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of what this life could be, how it might unfold, who I would be, and what it would feel like to be me at these various points throughout my life.  <br>It was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side and you started at the thick part of the trunk and then worked your way out towards the branches. There were thinner, less likely branches, but there were some thicker branches that were very likely to happen. It was like that, except it was energetic and probabilistic about how my life would or could unfold.  <br>So, I reviewed it with great excitement. I asked certain things about the life. I asked if I could, for instance, be intelligent in this life. I knew that I had preferred to be intelligent in previous lives, and they said yes, I could do that.  <br>I knew that it would be important for me to be male in this life because I knew that being male would give me a certain kind of edge to face this fear. Not that females—that's nothing against the two sexes here. I just know that there's a certain quality to being male that happened to be helpful in this case for me to meet this certain fear.  <br>I knew that my father in this life would instill confidence in me, and that that confidence would be paramount to me being able to have a chance to meet this fear when it arrived. In my 20s, it did arrive. I saw that there was a very likely chance that I would suffer a trauma in my 20s that would crush me and allow me to re-engage this fear.  <br>That did happen. I did experience that. So, I reviewed all this, and then I know there was a moment to say yes. I don't remember that moment, but I do remember then being in a waiting area and waiting to begin. Then, this guy came to me and said, "Go now," very suddenly, grabbing my attention like, "Now's the time. You gotta get on Earth time now, buddy. Move it."  <br>Then, I was with these guides that I can only describe as technicians or tinkerers. They're very mechanical in nature, and they do this thing where they match you with the life—the spirit, the soul of certain qualities, a certain nature to its essence—and the life has certain context and things going on with it in the body.  <br>They do this thing where they make it all fit so that the veil is personal for you. So, then I was there in this room with them. I saw what looked like a huge pit leading down, and they asked me one last time, "Are you sure? Are you sure you want to do this? Because once you say yes here, you're in for the ride. There's no getting out of the roller coaster once you say yes here."  <br><br><br>I agreed, and then I remember the veil coming over me once again and once again feeling this incredible descent, this incredible drop in vibration, and having my knowing be cut off. Feeling like everything that I was disappearing and all my connectedness feeling like it was vanishing.  <br>Arriving to this place that just felt so dark, alone, empty, and dense—all those things. So, in this case, I just tried not to fight it because I knew that I had failed the previous time by rejecting it. So, I just said, "Okay, just let go. Surrender your control and let the veil do what it will do."  <br>So, that happened, and I remember sending one message back to the technicians: "Did it take?" And they sent one message back: "Yes, it took." And I was happy and relieved that I had made it. I made it here.  <br>So, then I was here for a while, and then after a while, I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I'm not myself. I'm not tolerating this. I'm not doing this."  <br>So, once again, I began to muster my might to fight my way out. As I did that, this most beautiful moment happened for me that's very precious to me. What I can only describe as the great spirit of Source, God—whatever word we want to use—came to me and showed me, released me back out for a moment, and showed me all of what I was.  <br>I felt all of the stars and the universe within me, and I felt the joy and the bliss of being. I felt the bliss of the sun churning, and how the very churning of the sun was full of bliss. The spirit said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this."  <br>So, that calmed me a lot. It really was like, "Oh, that's wonderful. That's still what I am. Okay, that's okay." So, I surrendered. I let go into the simple existence of being in the womb.  <br><br><br>Then, I was there for a while, and the next memory I have is being born. I remember the shock of being born—the sight, sound, the sensory information, the cold touching. But I remember having no intellectual understanding at all. It was just totally like, "Something's happening. I don't know what it is. It's extreme. Who are these beings who are taking care of me?"  <br>I could recognize there were beings that were doing things, but it was very shocking. I didn't have any understanding at all, but I remember being very curious. So, that's pretty much it.  <br>Later, as I grew, I thought back to these memories, and I used to look back at the flowchart memory and cheat a little bit, try to see what was going to happen. Like, "Oh, what's going to happen tomorrow?" Just because, as a kid, you're curious about what's happening.  <br>I remember assuming that certain things from that higher state of being, the other realities, would be true here. For instance, I remember assuming that everybody would be able to feel each other's emotions here because that's very normal in other reality systems—that we can share our feelings, we can share who we are.  <br>That's not how it works on Earth. I also remember believing that people who are in positions of authority in this world would be loving and wise—like teachers, or if you're the mayor of a city, you must be super loving and wise. That kind of thing.  <br>Well, that's not really how it works on Earth either. It took me years to realize, "Wow, this human society doesn't really know what's going on." Anyway, that memory left me by the age of five or six, definitely by seven, but probably by five or six.  <br>So, I had no recollection of that at all. It wasn't until after I had experienced this great trauma at the age of 22 and spent about seven or eight years going through counseling, EMDR therapy through a counselor, and facing and feeling these levels of fear that had given rise to this experience in my 20s.  <br>I faced and felt it and healed a great deal. I now know that only because I did that and then subsequently took up meditation that this awareness could return. Because now I'm at a different vantage point than I was before. I would not have been able to meet that experience and to really have that experience otherwise.  <br><br><br>I appreciate you sharing that with us. Let's go back to the beginning here. When you met this being, did you feel like it was just a regular human, or do you feel like it was some kind of ascended master that had been on Earth and kind of mastered Earth?  <br>So, we're not human. It's not a matter of whether he was human. Human is just a character that we experience being for a while. I actually don't know what race or even what world he was on or what. I don't know anything about that. I just know that he shared with me the physicality of his experience and the pain that he experienced in his physical body that lasted for years.  <br>It could have been human, but I don't know. As for being an ascended master, all I can say is this being was incredibly evolved and powerful. That power, that quality of his nature, was so deep and apparent and feelable. I could feel it just being with him, and I could feel all that joy that he knew within himself.  <br>So, does that make him an ascended master? I don't know. I wouldn't put a name on him. I don't know. I'm careful not to do that, but I just know that he was very evolved. So, in that sense, perhaps, but I don't know.  <br><br><br>It appears that you came to this life with your main goal of being able to overcome fear. At this point in your life, do you think you've achieved that goal?  <br>The quality of what I'm trying to do is too broad for a single path, but I have accomplished—I hate to use the word "accomplished" because it makes it sound so human-like—I have done an important part of the walk in this life, a very important part. I've taken a very important step.  <br>I feel that I have integrated the main thing that I need to integrate in this life, but it's an ever-going thing. It's complex, and our limitations and our fears are not like one thing. They're connected to other things. So, it can be a lifelong walk.  <br>So, if and when fear arises or pain arises, that's okay. I choose to allow that and experience that and not fight it. Every time, it is an opportunity. But I will say though that I am at a place now that is vastly different than who I used to be because I've been willing to face and feel the crap, own my own crap.  <br>I'm still trying and working. I'm still trying to do that and work towards doing anything.  <br>You were using the word "the veil." I feel like it's kind of a loose term from person to person. Some people will describe it as if they've pierced the veil, and now after they've had their NDE, they're able to keep tapping into other resources or abilities that they didn't have before this near-death experience, like as if there's a crack into it.  <br>What is your opinion on that?  <br>Yeah, I know. I think that is how it works. The veil is just a term we use. The way I like to describe it is it's a set of consciousness constraints that you agree to accept. To put it in a human metaphor, it's like wearing a cloak or getting into a spacesuit or something.  <br>It's something that gets draped over you, over your pre-existing consciousness. We exist before we're born, and then when we have full access to all knowledge of who we are and what is, the veil allows us to be cloaked from the totality of what we are so that we can have the very precious experience of operating from the human vantage point.  <br>It allows us to be this specific human character and to truly be this human character. The very precious rubber-meets-the-road thing is that you don't have full conscious memory access to everything else that you are. You have to be just the human character.  <br>So, then when you're done with the experience, you can look back and say, "Oh my goodness, I was actually that. I had this perspective of being this person and only this person, and wow, that was incredible."  <br>But what we really are never changes. This is super important. Our consciousness, our spirit itself, is always what we truly are, and it's always connected to all things. We are always ourselves. It can't truly be totally veiled.  <br>The veil is simply a set of constraints that we've agreed to surrender ourselves to for a while. So, it's like something we wear. Near-death experiences—those who may have been relieved of it for a time—I do feel that it is pretty common that then once they're here, the veil is never fully applied in the same way again because they've already stepped past it.  <br>So, you can't go back because now there's like—I guess "piercing the veil" is an okay physical metaphor. I mean, it's not a physical thing, but yeah, that's not a bad way to put it.  <br><br><br>If you have pierced the veil, do you feel like that once you've had some type of an experience like that, is it lessening your experience now because it's kind of like in a game you have this advantage now?  <br>Well, first of all, I would not say it's an advantage. In fact, I feel that having some active conscious awareness of our higher natures can be a disadvantage because the contrast is even greater.  <br>Because now the contrast between there and here is known, at least in part, and the other side is such high vibration, so beautiful, so full of life, joy, power, freedom, and beauties that cannot even be named.  <br>Having even the tiniest bit of awareness of that and being here can be super painful. It can also prompt a homesickness that can be debilitating.  <br>As for does it lessen the human experience? Well, in my pre-birth memory, I remember asking to have a very small amount of memory this time. I didn't want to forget all the way, and they said that I could do that. They would make this life more challenging because of the contrast I just mentioned.  <br>But I knew in that state that even that contrast was an opportunity for growth. Even that contrast—all contrast is a creative tool. It is an opportunity. So, I knew that was the case, and I agreed.  <br>Now, does it change the human experience? Yes, it certainly changes the human experience. You know you're not the human character all the way, so that will change what is possible from the human experience.  <br>Does that lessen it? I wouldn't say it lessens it. It's just a different type of experience with different opportunities. Again, our perspective is important. Where we operate from can provide a meaning or an opportunity.  <br>So, if you change that with awareness of our higher selves, then there's just a different opportunity.  <br>Just having some type of certainty that we even continue on after this life—and not only having that but, like you said, experiencing a place that's so amazing, connective, loving—re-experiencing that and then being back here brings up a whole new set of circumstances that you've got to learn to deal with.  <br>Well, I'm very fortunate that I'm veiled. I relate to near-death experiencers who have really pierced the veil, so to speak, and they do suffer, like you just said, because now they have to deal with the new circumstances.  <br><br><br>Do you think that as someone who has a near-death experience, that was planned before coming into this life?  <br>So, sometimes those experiences are planned, and sometimes they're not planned. Just like certain exit points in our lives sometimes are planned and sometimes they're not.  <br>In my case, I'm aware of at least one potential exit point that may happen in my future. I don't talk about it, but I know that it's possible. I feel that I've been reducing the probability of it occurring.  <br>So, because of that, I feel that it's very possible that certain events like an NDE could be planned. But I think the thing is, this physical experience is a free-willed system. There are billions of people making choices every day.  <br>While spirit is super good at anticipating the choices that will be made ahead of time, it is free will, and so unanticipated outcomes happen all the time. So, because of that, there is a novelty to this experience.  <br>Actually, that's one of the main beautiful points that Earth offers—it offers a chance at true novelty. Because here, there are things that may happen that are not anticipated, and then we have to decide how we're going to deal with that.  <br>So, sometimes even things like physical death or an accident could potentially happen in a way that was not anticipated, or it could be planned, depending.  <br><br><br>I won't let everybody know that Christian has a new book out, and it's called A Walk in the Physical. This book draws from his pre-birth memories. I was taking a look at his book, and I have some questions here that I've kind of taken from your book.  <br>First, simply, what in your opinion is consciousness?  <br>So, when we're here on Earth, we perceive that reality is comprised of things—stars, trees, objects, linear time, discrete location. This is how we perceive reality. So, when we seek to understand reality with a thinking human mind, we want to know what things reality is.  <br>So, when we ask a question like, "What is consciousness?" consciousness must be something, and there are these other things called stars and trees. So, what is consciousness? What other things can I associate with it that will let me understand what it is?  <br>Unfortunately—actually, very fortunately—I should reiterate that fortunately, there is nothing that can truly describe what consciousness is because it is the substance of what is. It is the substrate within which all this form is arising and occurring.  <br>So, you can't take a given descriptor, a given form, and say, "Oh, consciousness is that." Consciousness is the "that which is." It's the beingness that knows existence. It is the "I" perspective. It is the knower of the form. It is not the form itself.  <br>I'm sorry if that sounds abstract, but I do feel that's very important because it's like the question, "Who is God? What is God?" You cannot potentially take some set of words and successfully say, "Oh, now we've identified what it is."  <br>We can use metaphors. So, if you want to use a metaphor, consciousness is like—if existence is the ocean, consciousness is the water. The things that occur in the ocean are made of water. The currents move, and the water moves. The water has different salinity in different places, different temperatures, different movements, but it's all water.  <br>That's an okay metaphor for what consciousness is.  <br><br><br>Would you say that your body and what you are in this realm is a manifestation of consciousness in this realm, and when you leave this realm, consciousness—the "I am," as you said—is in another form?  <br>Yes, oh yes. So, the body—this is going to sound pretty strange to some people—but the body is actually not a fundamental object that you're in. The body is an experience that is happening in you.  <br>The "I" that is knowing having a body feels like it's the body, but the body is actually made of and is taking place within the consciousness of the participant itself.  <br>There are states of being that you can know that physically feel it. It's like this inverted moment—I don't know how to describe it—where it's possible, through meditation or some action you can perform, to feel experientially know that your body is actually happening within your much greater, broader consciousness that transcends the locality of it.  <br>Now, does that consciousness affect how the body manifests? Yes, very much. Our fears, our thoughts, our intentions, our love—all impact the body and its chemistry every day.  <br>There are different sets of constraints we sign up for biologically. So, if you want to sign up and have a body that is missing a certain gene or has one arm or is blind, that is the nature of your constraints for that body for the lifetime.  <br>So, there are certain limitations to what you can do. Well, I want to say there are limitations, but also there's not a true limitation because ultimately consciousness has the true power. So, technically, there's nothing that's beyond the scope of consciousness.  <br>But realistically speaking, day-to-day speaking, there are such things as limitations that we deal with physically. And then we see how we operate within those limitations.  <br>Can we affect those limitations? Definitely, very much so.  <br><br><br>Based on what you're saying, that consciousness is what you are, then how does somebody have an out-of-body experience? If that is what you are, how does that separateness occur?  <br>It's an excellent question, and it's actually so—the short comment is the body, your physical body, is an experience happening within you. And so are other reality systems that you can engage that are very physical and real-feeling, just like your body feels very physical.  <br>There are higher states of being that are even more—at least as physical—they feel completely physical when you're there, but they're higher. They're different reality systems.  <br>So, how is that occurring? Well, you don't actually have to leave a body because the body is—to borrow a term from Tom Campbell—it's virtual. It's an experience that is taking place on that which already exists, which is your consciousness itself.  <br>So, it's more like your consciousness—think of it like a movie screen with a movie playing on it, but you can tune into other movies. So, now instead of the physical movie playing on it, you can go to another reality system, and now there's a completely different movie with completely different content, completely different rules, completely different everything on the same existing movie screen that never went anywhere.  <br>Consciousness doesn't have to go anywhere. There is no such thing as discrete location. It's not like you're sitting there stuck in your body, and I'm sitting here stuck in my body. What's happening is you're conscious and aware, I'm conscious and aware, and we're having an experience that is virtual.  <br>It seems like you're there, I'm here. It seems like this is my form, that's your form, but really what's happening is an experience—my experience, your experience, and the experience of everyone else listening today. That's really what's happening.  <br>So, that consciousness that is knowing those things is not technically limited to the physical experience. Tom Campbell describes it as a data stream. Like, your consciousness is receiving a data stream, and if you tune into another reality, you are receiving a new data stream rather than the physical one.  <br><br><br>In your book, you talk about the prism of the human mind. Can you tell us about that?  <br>Yeah, so the reality that we're in right now is very dense and rigorous, but it's also neutral. So, what I talk about is how we place the meaning on our lives through interpretation and belief.  <br>Okay, so then we believe something. When we're young, we're taught many things by our parents. Most of it we just absorb and buy into, and then as we get older, we may question those beliefs.  <br>But whatever we believe about ourselves and about the world, that is how ourselves and the world appear to us. Okay, so like if you believe the world is a dark and evil place, you will see the evidence of that everywhere you look.  <br>If you believe the world is a beautiful place, you will see the evidence of that everywhere you look. Not only because the mind tends to be selective of the information that it beholds, but also because consciousness is always applying the meaning.  <br>So, Earth is an opportunity to have a certain cognitive perspective—the human perspective. And what I mean by the prism is the entire experience of this reality around us is bent to an appearance that aligns with exactly what we perceive about it, exactly what we believe about it.  <br>So, our minds are very powerful, not only in that they change how we perceive the world, but also then whatever we expect and whatever intent we are wielding, and all of our choices—that very intent itself—those things are actually affecting the world physically too.  <br>The world actually manifests differently depending on what's going on in our consciousness. So, the human mind is actually very important. We focus so much on things here—physical events, what we can see, smell, touch.  <br>Even more important is what meaning are we placing upon it, and why, and who are we really? Who's the "I" that is doing that? That is the more fundamental question.  <br>And as we explore that, oh man, there's so much amazing potential that we can have in our experience. We can change how we experience life, and we can change things in life for the better when we're able to do that within ourselves.  <br><br><br>You just said we could change things in life for the better, but does that negate the point that what we came here for was to experience life of possible suffering or whatever we needed to learn?  <br>Okay, so the possible suffering that we're here to experience—it's not that we come for suffering. We are beings of love, freedom, and joy. That's who we are.  <br>And then we engage a reality of very high constraints. It's more about the extremity of constraints. It's not about required suffering. In fact, there's never technically a requirement to suffer.  <br>There are only very extreme constraints that we try to engage the best we can, and that means that we try to meet with a quality of intent that is the best we can—that is loving intent and not fearful intent.  <br>That's what the whole name of the game is about—love. Can we meet every given experience with love and all the things love means, and not fear and its ego and all the things that fear and ego mean?  <br>So, we are allowed to be free of suffering in these constraints. In fact, that is a most worthwhile and beautiful thing to do. It's not that suffering has been created because it's necessary and it's this thing that we've got to have.  <br>No, suffering happens because we're imperfect and we haven't evolved all the way yet. Suffering happens because we engage in a super high-constraint experience of separation, and then we panic because now that we're separate, "Oh my gosh, I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's real. I feel like I have no power."  <br>And then fear arises, and then once the fear arises, we spend so much effort and energy in our lives trying to cover up and heal that fear, do whatever we can to fix that fear. That's what the ego does.  <br>Any belief I can grab onto that'll make me feel better about myself or my group, I'll grab onto that. Or anything I can define what I have value now because now I did good in college, or I got a good-paying job, like I have money in my bank account, so now I'm worthwhile.  <br>The ego plays all the tricks it can to try to fix the problem, which is that we feel separate and that we don't fully remember who we are. But none of that—nothing in none of that is suffering actually required.  <br>It's that we come here to do our very best to meet those experiences the best we can, and as we all evolve towards love, suffering will very greatly reduce and diminish, and perhaps someday even be mostly gone.  <br>I mean, there's going to be physical pain. I'm not including physical pain in the term suffering. Physical pain may happen, but even physical pain itself is just a sensation. It doesn't have a meaning on it until you put a meaning on it.  <br>So, in that case, even physical pain is not an unacceptable experience. And I say that coming from a lifetime of knowing pain. That's what I'm here to deal with—my fear that I'm here to deal with is the inability to escape pain.  <br>So, I don't say that lightly. I know that it can be very, very hard to meet one's experience with openness, acceptance, presence, and love when you're in pain. But is there a need ever to suffer through that? Technically, no.  <br>In fact, it is a great calling to do the very best we can to heal that suffering, to heal the world. That's a wonderful thing.  <br>So, it's not that we sign up just for suffering. It's that we sign up for high constraint, and then we see the very best how good can we do in that contrast.  <br>Now, it can be useful for others. There are experiences that can be had only through certain high-contrast situations, definitely. But will those high-contrast situations perpetuate forever? Is that the goal? No.  <br>The goal is to evolve towards love, to really evolve what we truly are so that even those high-contrast situations can be met with love, peace, joy, and presence. And when we do that, suffering will no longer arise.  <br><br><br>Are you saying that we have ego because that helps us with our ability to handle fear, or is ego something separate than fear, and that's something else that we need to work on? And if so, how do we work on reducing our ego?  <br>Yeah, I feel that ego arises from fear. It is simply the term we use for the portion of the self—the portion of the human personality, the portion of the self, not the higher self, the local personality—the portion of the self that tries to fix the problem of fear.  <br>So, ego is a direct sign towards fear. Where there is ego, there's a fear somewhere—maybe hundreds of layers down, maybe under hundreds of layers of story and crap, but at the bottom of that is something we're not willing to face or feel, something we reject, something that prompts a huge amount of fear in us.  <br>So, ego is actually a helpful signpost because it can be like, "When you identify in yourself, what is it that you're afraid of? What is it in what way are you rejecting reality that you have this ego?"  <br>So, you don't really need to work on ego. You basically need to work on fear, and ego will dissipate on its own.  <br>Yes, I think that's an okay way to put it, but for those who are not able to locate a root fear, which is very common, start with ego because ego is the surface. So, you have to start at the surface to get down to the root.  <br>I've never been a Buddhist, so I don't know for sure what they do, but I feel like being a Buddhist monk is something that's pretty much an experience of trying to be egoless.  <br>So, if the idea of being egoless is arising from ego, it is still ego. But if the attempt to face ego is true of heart, true intent, then they will be given opportunities, like all of us will, to face and feel what is necessary.  <br>I mean, all of us are here to evolve towards love, which includes facing fear and ego because that's what we really are—love.  <br>So, when we're ready to do that, whatever the context—whether it be Buddhist or some other context—when we're really ready to do that, or we're actually ready—not just in my mind like, "I'm spiritual now. I'm going to do the spiritual thing. See, look how good I am."  <br>I mean, when you're really ready to own your crap and to, with humility, meet your own garbage, take ownership for your own life, take ownership for yourself—you've had enough suffering from all the ego that's not ultimately working—then the universe will give you opportunities.  <br>Your higher self will give you opportunities. These things will arise for you to be faced and felt, no matter the context.  <br>Do you think that the point of coming to Earth is only for personal growth?  <br>No. Any time the word "only" is in there, it's probably not accurate because spirit is very broad and in its totality.  <br>Okay, so the primary thing that the universe offers is the opportunity for the expansion of joy and love through the integration of experience through choice-making.  <br>But we are also extremely creative beings, and so another major thing that the physical experience offers is the ability to participate in creativity in very new ways. In fact, a lot of people are here on Earth with life intentions that are based in creativity—sometimes very unique goals of creativity that won't even make sense to the human mind.  <br>But we are so creative that, boy, this is one heck of a canvas if you can metaphorically paint the picture on Earth or maybe even literally. Wow, that is an incredible feat.  <br>Another thing that we do here on Earth is we come for each other. You know, because others have come, and we love each other, and we want to serve each other and help each other.  <br><br><br>So, many people come just to play some role or be some person or some support for a friend or a family member. The words "friend" and "family member" are hard to differentiate because we're all very deeply connected to each other. We're all family.  <br>But for our family, we come to serve them in some way, and that would be an intention born primarily out of love.  <br>Now, does it have to be only one of these things? No, of course not. All experience is rich in its opportunity, and it's just that being human and being on Earth is such an extreme and unique and high-contrast opportunity that it's just chock full of potential.  <br>It's chock full of—I don't know how else to put it—the language really limits this. It's full of what can arise from it, the ways we can change, the ways we can serve each other, the things we can create through it.  <br>And then that change that we do in ourselves, by the way, not only is local here on Earth, we also are affecting other reality systems right now just by being here.  <br>There are entire other reality systems that are thought-responsive that arise from the thought environment of Earth. That sounds super abstract, but even doing things on Earth in that way affects other reality systems.  <br>We're participating in other reality systems without even knowing. So, it's a pretty broad question, but I'll just say that expansion of what we are, expansion of love and joy, is the primary thing, but it's far faster than that.  <br><br><br>I talk to UFO people, and I talk to some near-death experiencers that when they're out there in the astral or whatever you want to call it, some people will see God or Jesus or angels, but some people will see aliens.  <br>And you just mentioned other realities. What is your opinion on that? As I bring this up to you, what is my opinion on which aspect of that?  <br>Well, what do you think about? Do you think that what other realities are—are consciousness living as other beings like alien beings?  <br>Yes. This doesn't have to be a human. It can be a gerbil, or it can be an alien on another planet. Our galaxy is ridiculously vast, talking hundreds of billions of stars, each with its own systems.  <br>There are probably many planets out there, and so incarnation can occur on any of them. It doesn't have to happen on Earth. But then our entire physical experience—okay, our entire physical system—imagine it metaphorically like a video game server.  <br>It's one server. You don't have to come to this server. You can log into a different server, some with very different rules. And there are systems above systems. The astral is just the word we use for the thought-responsive reality system.  <br>Typically, the way it's used is the thought-responsive reality system preceding ours, where thoughts are like physical objects, and there's a lot that takes place from there. But that's just another system.  <br>So, yes, consciousness knows it all. The knower is the shared root, and that knower can be many things. Like right now, we are playing being humans, or we're not just the human either. We are still our higher selves, which just means the higher portion of us that can do many other things too.  <br>And so, it may be that someone listening today is actually playing another character somewhere else, maybe even on the same planet. I don't know. There's a lot of things possible that we don't often consider.  <br>So, it's very vast. So, I don't know if that speaks to your question, but it's hard to nail down one comment in such a broad context.  <br>I just wanted to kind of pick your brain and see what you thought about that subject.  <br><br><br>What you just mentioned about our higher selves is a thing that I still kind of consider and try to wrap my head around—as you know, part of us is here, part of us is somewhere else, maybe the even bigger part of us is somewhere else.  <br>Yes, and maybe that part of us can be even doing something simultaneously as we are while we're here. Do you think that even when we're dreaming, are we tapping into our higher self in other places?  <br>So, to your initial question, yes, our higher self is doing other things. But you got to remember though—okay, this gets kind of hard to talk about from here because linear time itself on Earth is a creation. It's an invention.  <br>So, we like to think of everything in terms of the A-to-B time that we experience on Earth, but that time is not even fundamental. So, of course, the higher portion of us that is not bound to it is capable of things that to us seem simultaneous.  <br>Okay, so, but that being said, when we're asleep, we do visit other portions of ourselves, or the human personality portion of us will go do things.  <br>And sometimes I feel that dreams are interpretations of those other experiences into the experience language of the human personality. Sometimes dreams are—I feel, I think probably most of the time—dreams are something that our own psyche is creating within its own symbolism to help us deal with things in our lives that we need to process.  <br>Or they could even be of biological origin. You screw with brain chemistry, you can prompt dreams. But we do go have other experiences while our bodies sleep, and sometimes I feel that dreams are an interpretation of those experiences.  <br>I've had out-of-body experiences while my body sleeps in which I've interacted with other individuals where the environment may appear extremely Earth-like, but our bodies are not awake. We're in another place that is very physical, real—so real you almost can't tell the difference.  <br>I mean, it's just super real. Where is that taking place? Well, I would put terms on it, but I would say that's somewhere in the astral, perhaps in a thought-responsive place.  <br>I don't try to label that too easily. It's not really that important that we label it, at least that's how I feel. I feel like the human mind wants to categorize everything and put it in nice, neat buckets, but again, we're doing that from the human perspective, which is based on Earth, and so there's quite a limitation there.  <br>It's better to just go experience it and draw one's own conclusions about the structure.  <br><br><br>All right, well, I need to switch gears on you here because I'm running out of time. Where can someone find your new book?  <br>So, my new book, A Walk in the Physical, is on Amazon, but I also have it available for free on my website, iwalkinthephysical.com. The third link down on the book page is a link to the Google Books page, and there is a "Read for Free" button.  <br>You can look at it for free. I think it's important that we share this information. It's not about money. It's just important that we allow each other to share who we really are while we're here.  <br>The book is—I feel, to be honest—I feel like it's my life's work. It is my attempt to articulate the higher context of what we're experiencing in a concise way. It's non-linear, which some people may enjoy and some people may not, but it is the way that I felt guided by spirit to present it.  <br>So, I hope to be encouraging to those who read it, to help them sense who they really are underneath the human character and to know that there's nothing to fear. That's the main thing I really want to say—like, everyone who's listening today, being human is not easy.  <br>Okay, and I know there are super lots of reasons to be afraid, but ultimately, there is no reason to fear. There is ultimately no death, no actual true harm that can befall us, and most importantly, we are always, always, always loved—always so deeply loved.  <br>Like, whoever you are listening, not just this general nice fairytale love—I'm talking universe-generating, sun-churning love specifically for you. And you may be veiled from that for a while, but it is right there.  <br>And I really hope to remind you of that while you're here because that's like the most important thing we do for each other while we're here—remind each other this is who we really are, and there's nothing to fear, and love is always there for us.  <br>What do you think is the best way for people to overcome their fear?  <br>So, there's a term from—I'll borrow from Tom Campbell again—that I think is really key to that question, and that is "quality of intent."  <br>So, each person can find an awful lot about themselves if they really investigate the quality of their own intention. Why are they—why are you making the decision you're making today? Really, why? Are you willing to actually look and see—is it rooted in fear, or is it rooted in love?  <br>And as we are with so—willingness is key. Willingness and willingness not only to face and feel what's in there but willingness to own what's in there and to go find out what our quality of intent is and to try to improve it towards love.  <br>As we do that, there will be things that rise up for us to face and feel because we are integrators of experience. That's what we're doing. We are consciousness. We are the beings who are processing this, having this human experience, and doing what we can with it.  <br>So, when you're really willing to do that, and you're really willing to own your life and own your stuff and face and feel what is arising in your life, you'll be given the opportunities to do that in a very personal way.  <br>Maybe small, tiny little ways—it's not one activity that anyone can do. It's highly personal, but when you're willing to do it, you will be given a chance.  <br>And the good news is that process is a beautiful, good process, even if there are moments that you may need to face old fears or pains that you've buried for your whole lifetime that seem super dark.  <br>If you're willing to face that stuff, freedom is what we are. It's on the other side. It's waiting for you. Like, there's no—the more painful thing is to be stuck in all the stories of the ego forever and ever and to be living your fear all the time. That hurts.  <br>And many of us hurt so much in our lives for so many years, eventually we go, "You know what? I'm sick of being afraid. I'm sick of hurting. I'm sick of this." And then sometimes it takes us getting to that point that we're willing to actually own the crap when it comes up and face and feel the things that come up when they do.  <br>So, it's very personal, so I can't say just one thing, but willingness is key—willingness to find our own intention and what that intention is.  <br>All right, after watching this podcast, people may want to reach out to you and question you directly or contact you. Are you open to that, and if so, how may they contact you?  <br>Yeah, sure. I'm open to that. I have an email, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a> That's the same email address that's listed on the website, so they can just email me there.  <br>And yeah, I'm happy to speak to anybody who would like. It's important that we remind each other. I know this can seem pretty out there sometimes, but the truth is very freeing.  <br>So, yeah, I'm happy to interact with anybody. We're out in the wilderness now together, you know. We're out here in the weeds right now, all of us listening today that are physical. I'm sure there are non-physical beings listening too, perhaps, but the physical ones among us—we're out in the wilderness together.  <br>You know, we got to give each other a little fist bump in the middle of the woods and give each other encouragement. We can't because it's not easy. I know it's not easy. I know it's not easy.  <br>So, I'm happy to help in a small way if I can.  <br>Well, you've given us some good stuff, but before we finish, is there one last positive message that you can leave us with?  <br>Yeah, I just want to reiterate that whoever you are, you are loved, and you are not just the human character that you're playing.  <br>Like, who are you then if you're not the human character? If you're not your name, who are you? You're you—the you that feels like you to you, the you that most feels like you to you, the "I" that you feel, the precious "I" that you feel within yourself.  <br>That's who you are. That thing may be tied up within the human identity for a while, but that's not really what you are. Who you are far transcends it.  <br>So, when your story, when the things you believe that make your life dark and painful get wrapped up, allow yourself the space to step back and feel just for a moment underneath the story—who are you?  <br>Because man, there's so much power in that. It's far more powerful than we may think of day-to-day. So, I hope to encourage whoever's listening to do that and to remember, at least in small part, that you're not just the human character while you're on Earth right now.  <br>Well, thank you for that message, Christian, and thank you so much for being my guest. I really appreciate you, and I wish you the best.  <br>Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate it very much.  <br>All right, have a great rest of your day.  <br>Thank you.  <br>Thanks for watching the Jeff Mara Podcast. I really appreciate you.

 <br><br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh-ky_3ycWA" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh-ky_3ycWA" target="_blank">youtube.com/watch?v=Qh-ky_3ycWA</a><br>10 JUN 2021<br><br><br>So, welcome everybody to State of Mind Hypnosis. This is my channel, and I’d love to introduce Christian Sundberg. When Christian was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While that memory left him completely for his early adult life, it spontaneously returned 11 years ago as Christian took up a meditation practice and went through a personal awakening journey. He also began to have out-of-body experiences (OBEs). Christian now often speaks publicly as he seeks to remind others, at least in a small part, of who we really are beneath the human play.<br>Professionally, Christian has worked for over 15 years as a project manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing projects. Christian is the author of the upcoming book, A Walk in the Physical, which attempts to successfully describe the large spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey. So, welcome, Christian.<br>Christian: Thank you. I’m so honored to be here. Thank you for accepting my interview request.<br>Host: Yeah, sure. I’m happy to do so. This is an exciting time, right? It seems like a lot of us here today are healers. We’re here to help humanity on some level. I’m not exactly sure, but I like that.<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, there’s a great process happening now. We call it the awakening or some other terms, even the word “New Age” I think comes from this process. But the idea is that our collective consciousness is going through an important shift right now.<br>Host: Yeah, absolutely. And this kind of information is important. It can shake things up a little, but it’s important to remind each other who we really are.<br>Christian: That’s right. The truth of where we come from is wonderful and good. So, it’s just great to have the opportunity to share with others a bit of a reminder of what we really are underneath this play, as you mentioned.<br>Host: Right. I know I have all these dreams of theaters, and I don’t know why. Maybe it’s just my mind playing out the play, showing me a metaphor because I really don’t go to the theater that often—maybe once a year. I remember looking, and there was just ahead of me a guy in a chair, and I felt like it was a guide or something. He turned to me, and I was watching the play or something, and he said, “You are the light.” And I woke up, and it was just beautiful.<br>Christian: That’s wonderful. [Laughter]<br>Host: So, yeah, I wanted to ask you about the idea of pre-life planning. I know in other videos, we talk about your pre-life memories. We’re not going to get into those in this video—there are lots of others for whoever’s watching to go watch. But this is just kind of an overview of a lot of different stuff in this video about the other side, memories, reincarnation, maybe even out-of-body experiences. So, I’d love to just ask you how you go about thinking about pre-life planning.<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, well, I can only really speak to what I experienced. As you mentioned, I have pre-birth memory. When I was a small child, I remembered that we had come from somewhere else besides Earth. I knew we were just coming here to have a neat experience, but that memory did leave me for most of my life—left at about the age of six through about the age of 30. I’m 41 right now, and when I was 30, I began to take up a meditation practice, and the memory returned somewhat spontaneously. <br>I didn’t mention it for seven or eight years. It just didn’t feel like the right time, and also, this kind of thing—you don’t just go out and share it. It’s pretty unusual for what our mainstream society thinks about or understands. But it’s not something I think about every day. It’s too present. It’s just very influential on my day-to-day experience.<br>Okay, so part of that was, as you mentioned, the pre-life planning. So, in my case, I knew that I wanted to re-engage, re-experience an ancient fear—a very low-vibration fear that had bested me in a past experience. It had overcome me, and in a previous experience, I had died pretty painfully because of this fear. It had led me down a path, and I wanted to re-engage that fear, even though I knew it would be extremely challenging and difficult to do so. I discussed this with my guide, and it was such a vibrational extremity that I asked him, “Is it even possible? Has it ever been done in all of creation? Has a being ever integrated an experience at this extreme in this way?” And he shared, “Yes, it is possible. It has been done, and you have all time available to you to do so.”<br>And I just knew in my being, well, if it can be done, I can do it. I will do it. I just had this great confidence that if it was possible, I will do it, even though it seemed very challenging vibrationally to come this far into this deep of a constraint set and to meet a fear that was this low vibration and to integrate that fear. <br><br><br>So, in my case, the pre-life review for this life was—I don’t want to say even primarily around that fear, but it was a really important aspect of what this life would offer me. And I reviewed what I can only describe as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold—what was very likely or what was less likely to happen.<br>And it wasn’t so much events—I mean, there were events in this review, there were specifics—but it was more about what it would actually be like to be this person, to experience this from this perspective, and to be me. Because I find that, in general, in the physical, when we talk to each other, we like to discuss events, actions, time. Well, in the non-physical, information exchanges are far more complete. There’s like a telepathic exchange that’s very rich and thorough, and it really is about what is it to be you and what exactly are you experiencing—not just, you know, did you go to this place or did you buy this thing. It’s certainly not that limited.<br>So, in this case, my pre-life review was in such a way where I was reviewing what I can only describe as a flowchart. It looked like if you laid a tree on its side—this is just a metaphor—but if you laid a tree on its side, and it was very thick at the front, and it kind of went out into branches that were thinner and thinner the further out you went. It was kind of like that. And there were certain avenues of the life that were very highly likely and some that were very unlikely.<br>Host: Oh, wow.<br>Christian: And so, what was the thing that determined how that would play out? Well, at the time, it was unknown at the time I reviewed it because there’s free will choice-making going on all over the place, both by me and by every other player in the game—every other person here. So, there’s a lot of interaction happening that’s continually changing how it will unfold, how it seemed to be unfolding. But I knew in reviewing this pre-life plan that it was extremely likely that I would be traumatized in my early 20s—early or mid-20s. I even thought about it in numerical ages. I had a very structured way of reviewing even numerically that it would be in my earlier mid-20s that I would very likely be crushed and traumatized in a very extreme way, and that it would give me the opportunity to re-experience this very low-vibration fear that I had experienced in a past experience.<br><br><br>And so, I was super excited. I mean, that’s like the most—so I have to just say for anyone who’s listening today that the opportunity to be human is such a precious gift. It’s not like we’re thrown in here, you know, like we’re forced to do now. We choose to come, even though there’s a very—even though the constraints here are off the charts, even though being human is an extremely low vibration by comparison state of being, and even though there’s a lot of difficulties that we can deal with day-to-day here on Earth—from that side, the opportunity of the contrast is seen, and there was so much opportunity in this life experience layout—I don’t know how else to describe it—that was being that I was reviewing that I was very, very excited. Excitement is the overwhelming emotion. <br>It wasn’t—I mean, you could say there is even some objective trepidation or something, but all is well though from that side. You know that there is no way to fail. You can’t actually truly be harmed. You can only have this deep, convincing experience, go see how far you can go, and then see how you can deal with that experience and how you can integrate that experience and how you can bring love into that experience.<br>Yeah, and that was seen to me. I was just deeply humbled and honored that I would have the chance to do this. And I knew that this trauma that would follow me would crush me in a way that I had never quite experienced before. And I knew that the life trajectory because of the setup of this life and because of the limitations of the body—I knew that this biology has certain unique limitations. I knew that I would be going further out in one experiential direction—one energetic direction—than I had ever gone before. And I knew that it would send me far past—it’s hard to explain.<br>Okay, so I just have to interrupt and say that all this is almost impossible to describe. I usually begin any conversation with this disclaimer that these things cannot possibly be said in words because who we truly are transcends the entire world of form, the entire world of duality. It transcends linear time, distance, words. It’s so rich and vast and full that there’s no way that I can use words. <br>So, I’m just kind of clunking around in the dark trying. So, I just want to make that disclaimer because that’s super important because it’s not—it cannot be literally just—there’s no way to bring earthly words, this lower vibrational simple language, to that which is so great.<br>But anyway, I knew that I would be going past what I can only describe as like—if all the distances I had known and experienced in past experiences had little outposts or something—like how far I had gone before—this vibrational direction would take me way past in one direction that I had ever experienced. And I’m there right now. Like, I actually feel this incredible distance away that I am.<br>Host: Yeah.<br>Christian: And I seek to integrate that distance while I’m here in my day-to-day experience.<br>Host: Absolutely. Are you able to—I know from a lot of groups that I’m in, and sometimes even clients say that when we’re here, we say, “I don’t want to come back.” Right? Yeah, you’re gonna come back. I often speak to it saying, “Well, if you know you’re home and you’re coming back again, then you’re not scared to come here, right?” For the most part, I’m angry. Would you agree with that?<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, I agree. I agree with that. So, from—okay, so this state of being that we’re in right now is one of parent separation. We feel separate from one another, and we are in an experience of extreme separation right now. This is not typical. This state of being human—whoever is listening today—you know, the state of being you and being human and feeling separate from everyone else and from the world and feeling alone—it is an extremely unique and alien state by comparison of what we normally experience and who we normally are in the spiritual realm. <br>We engage in many other experiences that are not this extreme. Only the bravest among us—I would say—I mean, I don’t want to take this literally, but only the bravest are going to sign up to do this because it’s such an extreme experience of separation, and it can prompt a lot of fear.<br>And I shared in my pre-birth experience video that when I first incarnated, when I first accepted the veil—which is the constraint and consciousness space that are applied and or wrapped around you—I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s just a bunch of constraints that come over you, and you have to surrender to it. <br>And amongst those constraints is the experience of separation—feeling alone and being cut off from all your knowing—like all the rest of what you know, which is a lot. It’s everything. You’re being cut off from everything else. And so, for me, I responded in fear immediately after accepting the veil. So, I’m putting that in perspective because indeed, the constraints of being in this place can be very high. I mean, the vibrational place is very extremely low by comparison.<br>So, what happens is we get here, and we immediately have fear because we haven’t yet fully integrated an experience of this extremity and this distance. And so, when we have fear, ego naturally immediately arises and tries to come to the rescue for the power that seems to have been lost. We seem to have lost all this power. We seem to have lost this connectedness and this love. It seems to have vanished. So, the ego just frantically rises up and tries to do whatever it can to reclaim the power—establish beliefs, justify the self, focus on the self, get the next thing that makes me feel whole for five minutes—whatever it can do.<br><br><br>So, I’m stating that in the context of your question because usually, it’s from the egoic standpoint that we say, “I’m not doing this ever again. This is too hard.” Usually, what’s happening is we’re in resistance to the fear that we have not yet met in this life. Okay, so now that’s okay. It’s okay. There’s nothing wrong with that. That’s just how it is because we have yet to evolve fully to fully meet this experience. <br>But from the other side, from the spiritual side, it can be seen that all is well, and we are powerful immortal beings of love and joy, and our life is connected to all life with a capital L, and there is nothing to fear. That there is never anything to truly fear. That distance that we seem to come—I don’t want to say it’s not real, but it’s an illusion. It’s not fundamentally real. That’s the way I like to put it. Like, when we’re here, it feels real—like it’s a real experience being human—but it’s not a fundamentally real state. The form of Earth and the distance we experience on Earth is not fundamentally real.<br>So, we can see that from the other side, and also, we have access to all information. So, making the determination is done at the soul level—not the ego level, not the local human personality level—but the big you, the I that knows all the information, all the history. And that I is incredibly powerful and connected. <br>So, that is still you. It’s not a different being. Whoever’s listening, the you that feels like you to you is your soul. It’s still you, but from that state where you’re unveiled, there’s a much, much higher vantage point. And from that vantage point, it’s not like there’s ignorance. I mean, we can see that this might be a very extreme experience to be human, but nevertheless, it can also be seen that the opportunity for the expansion of being, the expansion of consciousness, the expansion of spirit, growth of love and joy, is so huge that it is often us who ask for something challenging and dive into a context that can seem very challenging.<br>And then, for many people—and it’s okay that this happens—many people will then spend a lifetime struggling with the challenges that are being met. We all do that to one degree or another. This is so extreme that it’s not something that we do all at once. So, I think that’s a long answer to your question, but I think that’s pertinent background for why here—you know, it’s kind of ironic because here, everybody just wants to be done and get out. <br>Yeah, not everybody, but most people are like, “I’m done with this. I don’t like this. This world’s crazy. I’m getting out of here. I’m never coming back.” Now, most people will say that. In fact, as you know, when I think from when I’m in my ego state, I feel the same way. Like, “I’m not doing this again. This is too much.” But I also know that I cannot judge as the human personality character. I don’t know. I can’t see well enough. So, all I can do is try to meet my experience the best way that I can.<br><br><br>Anyway, what I was going to say was it’s kind of ironic because everybody here wants to get out, but what’s very interesting is that on the other side, the opportunity to have a chance to be here and to play one of these characters and to be in this role is so precious. There are far, far more beings who are interested in participating than there are slots—you know, births, characters, avatars to play, you know, in those crude terms. So, we all want to get out, but it’s actually an opportunity.<br>Host: Yeah, so how do you think—do we put our hands up? Do we—because if a lot of beings are looking to come here to other planets or wherever, how is that chosen? Do you—yes?<br>Christian: Okay, so in my case, I remember that I wanted to meet this fear. I had reviewed who I was and who I had been with my guide, and then I basically—this is just so hard to explain because it makes it sound so limited—but I expressed what I was interested in doing, and they brought me a life. <br><br><br>Actually, as I mentioned in the other videos, this life was not the first life they brought me. They brought me another life that was more appropriate than this life is, and that other life, unfortunately, I basically wasted that life because when I accepted the veil, I was so overcome by fear within seconds of being there that I summoned my might and fought my way back out. I fought my way past the veil, and I inadvertently killed the fetus. I killed the body that was mine, and I had a life review, and I became aware that I had made the mother’s journey far more difficult—not only the poor mother but hundreds of other people would be affected by the mother and I, and I was responsible for that. I am responsible—well, I’m not going to put it in the past tense—I am responsible for that because that’s still me.<br>So, anyway, I was interested in still doing, and then they brought me this life. So, there’s—we might say there’s like a database, and spirit—especially the wise and loving guides who are helping facilitate this for us—are very good at very efficiently sifting through the information and seeing who you are and where you are energetically and in your growth path and bringing a life that will be optimal. <br>We could say it will provide enough challenge but hopefully not too much challenge. But usually, the soul who says, “I want more challenge because I want to go big—I want to go big,” yeah, and then they say, “So, at least I’ve read this in other forms, I’ve heard there’s some other experiences—no, that’s too much. Don’t bite off that much. You can’t chew that much.” Anyway, so in my case, it’s not that I went and found a life. <br>The guides brought the life to me, and then I reviewed it, and then I knew—okay, so my soul has certain qualities. The soul has many qualities. It’s very rich in its vibrancy and its nature, and that has to interface with the life and the—this is hard to explain, but there has to be like an integration of the two—like who the soul is and how the life will be and who they will be and what the biology and the circumstances and everything else. And so, that’s an important part of it.<br>Yeah, so in this case, they brought me this life, and I reviewed it, and I knew there were certain ways that it might not be perfectly appropriate for me, but it was good enough for my purposes. It was pretty good. So, I accepted it. So, I suspect that—I know that one of the teachers I really respect and admire is the physicist and consciousness explorer Tom Campbell, and Tom has said that beings with less experience don’t necessarily have a specific plan. They just want to get in and have experience and then get out, and that helps them just getting any experience. <br>And I suspect that’s probably true for those who have less experience, but I think that as we go through experience, as we grow, we become more and more specific about what we want to experience. And I’m being careful not to use the word “learn” only because it is learning, but it’s not intellectual learning. It’s not behavioral learning. It’s experiential learning. And so, like, to be what it is to be this—to apply oneself into this certain context—that’s what it’s really about.<br>So, I think—yeah, so I think that—I don’t know about other beings. I just know that in my case, I asked for something specific, and I was brought an opportunity.<br>Host: That’s amazing. I’m sorry—what are your thoughts on multiple lifetimes—simultaneous lifetimes—had by the same oversoul or higher selves? What are your thoughts on that?<br><br><br>Christian: So, I do think it’s possible for one soul to play multiple characters at the same time. Well, I know for certain that happens when you go to the higher levels of the now because the one great now in which all is occurring contains many experiences. But if you mean it in a more local sense of can one soul play two humans on Earth at the same time, I believe so. <br>Yeah, I did not review that in my own experience, but I know that the soul can do a lot more than just play one human at a time. You know, like, this is just a crude metaphor, but if you’re sitting at a computer and playing a video game—you know, we can only do one at a time—but imagine that the soul can sit at more than one computer at once. Yeah, and you know what I mean? So, it can engage multiple realities, multiple video games, and characters at the same time.<br>Host: Yeah, that’s a good metaphor. What are your thoughts on—I’m just thinking now that when I take clients through life-between-lives and the things they see sometimes—what are your thoughts on schooling there? You know, I don’t know—my mind’s exploding with all different thoughts, but I’ll go into one avenue. So, it’s this idea of learning while you’re there.<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, well, that definitely happens. Okay, so I have memories of some activities that I did in between physical lives, and some of them I would definitely call learning activities. And what I mentioned in the other video was I actually practiced surrendering to the veil because I had wasted that previous life, and I didn’t want to do that again. So, I practiced in this place that can be described as a room where it’s like jumping into a dark pool, and then it’s like a veil coming over you—this dark pool—and you go down, down, down in the pool, but you can cry uncle, and they’ll let you out because it’s not real. It’s just a simulator, so it’s for practice. You see how far you can go, and the real thing is much more difficult than the simulator, I remember.<br>But as for attending classes, what comes to mind is actually something that happened in this life. Okay, so when our bodies are asleep—I know this is going to sound strange to people—but when our bodies are asleep, we are still active. We go do things, and we don’t remember everything that we do because the veil is really good. It’s very effective at keeping us focused here, and we’re only remembering our day-to-day lives here. That’s what it does, and it’s super good at it. But we do go do things at night while our bodies sleep.<br><br><br>A few years ago, I had an experience where I visited a classroom as a super short-term visiting tutor or something—like a teacher to the—yeah, it was like just one very specific tiny lesson. And I was there with a friend of mine who is in this life with me now. This friend of mine—he and I are friends now as adults, but when we were in high school, this friend of mine was pretty mean to me at a certain time where he—I was interested in a girl, and so he approached this girl and had a romantic encounter with her kind of just despite me—just as a social positioning thing because humans do all sorts of crazy stuff like that.<br>So, anyway, in this experience, he and I were there in this classroom, and the classroom—okay, so in thought-responsive environments, the environment appears to match the energy of what is being taught. So, this environment, the way I perceived it, was black stone—very bleak and curved and just really lacking any comfort. Everything was black stone, everything was just the most basic cold material, just kind of trying to get the feet wet of these beings who were basically aspiring to incarnate and to come this deep and to do this type of deep experience. <br>So, all we were there to do is show them, “Look, we’re an example of what friends do on Earth—even friends.” Because we’re friends, and we were sharing with them, “Look, what this guy did to me—isn’t that kind of funny?” Because everything—everything’s just to say that from the higher perspectives, everything is really funny because we take our lives so seriously here, but they’re really okay. It’s just the play. We don’t take it so seriously.<br>But anyway, in this classroom, we were simply communicating to these beings—I don’t want to use the word “students” because that implies hierarchy, and it’s not hierarchical—but these beings who were learning, and we were basically just saying, “See, Earth is so hard. We’re even friends—friends. Well, even when friendship is close, and you only have so many friends, but even friends do this.” And they were like, “Oh, like that doesn’t make any sense. Friends are—because our friendships go so deep into the recesses of time. Like, we all have ancient, deep, deep, deep relationships that we temporarily forget while we’re here.” Yeah, anyway, that’s just what comes to mind about your classroom comment.<br>Host: And so, to jump off that—what about soul groups? Because I hear a lot—I see people go through it. What are your thoughts on that?<br><br><br>Christian: So, I don’t have any in my pre-birth memory. I had no interaction with that concept, but since I’ve been here, I feel that I—okay, I intuitively sense the soul family thing and who is in my soul family. And I’ve had two times in my life where I’ve come across someone who I did not know very well, but I was instantly certain they were in my soul group. Oh, yeah. And one person, I did not discuss it with because it would not have been appropriate within the human circumstances, but the other person, I ended up talking to her about it, and we had a bit of a non-physical exchange. <br>I don’t know—this doesn’t usually happen. I mean, I’m a pretty normal guy. I don’t usually, but I had a non-physical exchange with her higher self in a way that I was able to prove to her and I that it actually happened. And I think that was possible because her energy was very easy for me to feel. So, sometimes I feel the energy of people or places—like who they are, a little bit—just a little bit of who they really are. <br>And her energy was very easy for me to engage with because we were so similar and connected. I don’t know—there’s like certain qualities I could even probably try to point out about my soul tribe, and so it’s easy then to interact with a soul member. But I don’t know much about the topic in a tangible way beyond that. I just sense that soul families, soul tribes exist. I can’t explain how or what that means. I just sense that it’s real.<br>But the thing is, we’re all family though. Like, I don’t want to—okay, like, because here on Earth, we love our tribes, and we love us versus them, and my family versus your family, my nation versus your nation, my political group—who we truly are is so much beyond that. We are beings of love and connectivity and freedom, and there’s no boundaries to that. We are all brothers and sisters, and none of us are strangers to each other in a true sense. We’re strangers here on Earth because we’re veiled, and we have to play the roles and all that good stuff, but truly, we’re all connected. So, I don’t think it’s that pertinent to necessarily draw a distinction between a soul tribe or not. I think it’s just groups within groups within groups, but it’s all—we’re all connected.<br><br><br>Host: Yeah, absolutely. Like, the collective consciousness of humanity as a group, for instance—like everyone who’s participating in the human experience is lending their energy into a pond—an ocean of energy that is specific to the human experience. And that pond energy exists in higher thought-responsive realities as a thing—as a place—and within it is all of the context of everything that’s been thought and considered in the Earth environment, especially ideas or experiences that many of us have focused on. So, I’m just pointing that out in the context of your question because it’s very complex. There are collective groups, and so like even just the collective consciousness of humanity—like that is something we are all a part of, but it’s also its own thing.<br>Christian: Wow, absolutely. No, that makes sense.<br>Host: And while we’re on souls, I also see a lot of people struggling with—I’m not sure if you can speak to this, but I’ll ask it—I see people struggling with the thought of, “Okay, I have a higher self that’s put my personality into this body, but when I get back to that higher self, are they just—you know, what is that higher self? Do I merge back into that higher self and then forget everything? And who is that higher self? Are they existing right now with us along the same lines?”<br><br><br>Christian: Yes, so yeah, okay. So, you are the higher self too, and you are already on the other side right now. That is a really important idea because we—okay, so small children and babies—even though they’re veiled, they come and go quite frequently. They’re much more aware of the spiritual realm. I’m going to tie this back to your question because they’re not yet deeply associated with the identity of being human and the identity of being separate and the stories—the ego stories and the personality stories and the identity stories and the thoughts. We create this huge amount of thought momentum about who we are, what our problems are, and what we’ve got to do and all this stuff.<br>So, that thought bubble is what being human is all about, but your consciousness is already on the other side right now. It’s just that the veil helps you to be immersed without distraction. And when you are able to fully release the thoughts and the association with form, then the awareness that you really are—it’s beautiful—it can rise up on its own, and you’ll find that peace and joy and love are what you already are. And that’s not just an idea. Like, you don’t sit down and meditate, stop thinking, and now you get a new idea. It’s not an idea. It’s a tangible state of being that is known within the body of your awareness itself. And the you that you really are is that body of awareness. It’s not that you’re separate. It’s that the body of awareness that you are—you might think of it, to put it in earthly terms because we love breaking things down into pieces—but an earthly term that’s like the higher self takes a subportion of itself and allocates that into a veiled experience, and the rest of it is still on the other side. That’s an okay way to think of it.<br><br><br>In fact, there are no boundaries except the ones that we’ve lost ourselves within. So, that’s why meditation can be so helpful, by the way, as a tangent because as one meditates, one becomes increasingly familiar with what one really is, which is awareness itself, and the thoughts lose their oomph because you’re regaining your ability to not prioritize listening to them. You now focus power of focus, and when the thoughts lose their oomph, it means the ego stories lose their hump because there’s no—because now you’re not listening. Now, thoughts can’t save you from your own fears. What I’m trying to get to is that your fears may rise up, and they can seem silly on the surface of the thinking mind, but anything that’s stuck—anything that’s down there that you’re afraid of—self-perception, a perception about the world—can rise back up to be felt now because you are no longer lost in the story. And that’s good. That’s a good sign.<br><br><br>So, I’ll just leave it at that because I don’t think I can say anything else. I just know that it’s important to take the time, and taking the time to do this is very powerful because not only—and then people sometimes say, “Well, what do I get out of it?” Well, first of all, it’s kind of an Earth way to think, but what I was going to say is what you get out of it is that which is more valuable than anything you could find in an object. That is, if you even experience a small taste of the true peace of your being—and again, you didn’t go get it, but it can rise back up on its own when you’re fully present with the now—when you’re fully alert and aware and present and not judging and allowing all—then the peace that was always there can just reveal itself, and oh, it’s breathtaking. <br>It’s the most beautiful, precious—it’s the nectar of life. It’s like the bliss of being. There is no value we can put on that. And then, of course, immediately the ego will jump in, “Oh, what’s that? I gotta get more of that. I don’t want to lose that.” Yeah, okay, that’s okay. You know, that’s okay if it happens to me. That’s pretty normal. But still, one taste of that—one knowing of what we really are in even the smallest moment—it can be life-altering. You know, like, you can’t go back because you’ve made that connection, and it’s experiential, and it’s there.<br>Yeah, and yes, we can go deeper into the world of form. We can go back into focusing on form things and get lost in association, and we can come back. You know, there’s this waxing and waning that can take place, and that’s fine, but the value of that is beyond some achieving some end. You would find, though, naturally, though, at least I found that if I experienced that—when I experienced that—it’s everything in life. Like, all the things that were terrifying aren’t anymore, and all the limitations don’t matter. I don’t know—they’re beautiful. In fact, everything becomes so beautiful. <br>Yeah, like, you can look at a straw or a stone, and you’re not making it up because you’re high or something. No, you see this is beautiful. This is a form of existence, and you’re seeing it in a way that is not obscured by the thinking. Now, thinking is like being in a dream, and actually, thinking is like being in a pretty painful dream. Yeah, thinking can hurt. All the thinking—thinking, thinking, must do, must you, must do, must find, must still hold, must be the thing—I’m not good enough. <br>Oh my gosh, I heard what’s this pain? What did this person say? I mean, you know, that hurts. It’s not peaceful. Yeah, so it’s really wonderful, and it’s natural then as we do that, the ego can rise up even stronger sometimes. I’ve definitely experienced that because now, basically, it’s life—to put it in dramatic human terms—the ego’s life has been threatened. I mean, I’m being a little dramatic because it’s not like it doesn’t need to be dramatic at all, but the ego’s life has been threatened because you’ve begun to remove the pulls in the tent. Yeah, so the tent’s starting to come down, and so then the part of you that’s afraid will rush forward, “Oh, we gotta put this tent back up. We gotta put this tent back up. Where’s the tent going?”<br><br><br>That is a worthwhile journey. It is a very worthwhile journey because it’s basically the facing of fear, and that’s one of the reasons I love Tom Campbell’s work so much. His big core reality model focuses on love. <br>Love is the reason we’re here. Love is why we’re here, and in Tom Campbell’s model, conquering fear is synonymous with love. And that aligns so very much with what I experienced in my pre-birth experience and choosing this life. I knew that if I could integrate this fear—if I could meet it, face it, heal it, be fully present with it—then the native being of love that we are could expand in such a powerful, amazing way. Love is what we are. <br>We are already loved. Everyone is already of love. Everyone already wants love, needs love, loves love, loves giving love, is of love. Love and freedom and joy are the substance of what we are, and fear is—again, we’re so right now in duality, so we’re talking about duality like opposites as if they’re real, but even duality is a creative tool. <br>It’s not actually fundamentally real, but while we’re here, we experience fear because, like I said, we haven’t integrated this experience. We haven’t fully actualized our true loving nature here. So, when we meet fear and overcome fear, that’s so powerful because we’re liberating our true selves, and we are participating in the expansion of being simply by integrating the fear.<br>And so, that ties into the meditation comment because, like I said, if you meditate and if you really become aware of your own crap—you become aware of your own crap enough—you find that we have fear. We have deep, deep fear. I mean, this trauma that I experienced in my 20s—I had post-traumatic stress for eight years. I couldn’t even remember my life before the age of 22 very well at all. That’s how traumatized I was. Yeah, and I went through years of EMDR therapy with a therapist, and I found layer after layer after layer of fear. Fear—if you’re here—and I kept thinking, “Oh, that’s got to be the bottom because man, that was flipping terrifying.” <br>And oh my gosh, I can’t believe it. It kept going and going and going. Eventually, I did find the root moment in my life that was so painful and so terrifying that I had locked it away to save myself—I thought—but I didn’t save myself. I just locked it away. Locking away doesn’t actually heal it. Yeah, to heal it, we have to be willing to feel it. We’ve got to be willing to actually face that crap that’s down there—face our own darkness—like fully let it be. Let the pain be felt. Let it rage. Let the negative perception—the negative thing that we’re trying to resist—let it happen. Let it be experienced without fear because the light of your awareness—the beacon, the light—when it goes into those places, it has a profound healing power. <br>Not because you’re going and fixing a problem—you’re not doing this to go fix something—you’re going this to honor how you actually feel and to feel how you actually feel and to fully meet what you’ve actually experienced. That is what we’re here to do. That is what we’re here to do. We’re here to be human, to have that experience so that we can meet and integrate that experience. And that is the very crux of what makes this human experience so valuable and powerful.<br>You know, it sounds—I know all that sounds really scary to the ego and maybe even completely unacceptable. I get it. I’m not making light of it, and it’s okay. Like, being afraid is okay. Yeah, it’s okay to be afraid, but you have a choice then. Yeah, what do you do with the fear? You can ignore it and try to go on with your life and talk over it, or you can say, “You know what? I’ve had enough of the fear. I’m going to go feel it. Show me what there is to be afraid of.” Like, there’s a—and I know we’re a little bit over an hour already, but I just got to say this. <br>So, my father—when my father was a small child, he was afraid of his closet, and he would lay in bed and look at the closet, and every night he was terrified to go to sleep because of what he imagined was in the closet. Yeah, and he got so worked up, and it was so uncomfortable that eventually he said, “You know what? Whatever the hell is in that closet, it can’t be worse than this fear that I’m experiencing laying here every night.” So, he got up, and he charged into his closet, and he pushed his way through the clothes. He was being aggressive about it. He fought his way in there, and he sat down on the bottom of the closet, and he said, “Okay, monsters, eat me.” But they didn’t eat him because there were no monsters.<br>So, it’s a simple metaphor, and it sounds so silly, but all of us have that closet. Yeah, we all have that thing we don’t want to face. We don’t want to feel. Is he afraid of monsters in the closet anymore? No, there were no monsters. It’s not like he had to then tell himself, “Okay, now I’m not afraid.” No, he just knew there were no monsters because he saw, and so it was experiential. It wasn’t just an intellectual thing. That’s how we need to be with our fears, our darkness. There’s nothing to be afraid of down there except feeling it itself. You’re afraid of feeling it, but walk into the closet. It may feel like it’s going to destroy you, but it won’t. Yeah, no, that’s not true.<br>Host: That’s a good story. Oh my—well, I could talk about this all night—hours—but we’ll wrap it up. Thank you so much, Christian, and your information will be below this video. If you want to contact either Christian or myself, all that information will be below.<br><br><br>Christian: Okay, thank you so much. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks for the opportunity. It’s been a great conversation, and I just want to say one last thing. So, whoever’s listening to this today, I just want to encourage you for a quick moment that you are a beautiful, powerful being who has come here to do this. Okay, you’re in your life. You’re deep in your life experience right now. I may not know you. I can’t see you, but I’m telling you, you are a brave being for coming here. Thank you for being where you are in your life. <br>Go easy on yourself. Have fun today. Just be encouraged because it’s not easy going on this walk, but it is powerful. It is meaningful. It is a precious opportunity, and we are powerful beings that aren’t going to die. There’s no such thing as death. Just gotta say that. There’s no death, so we can live in accordance with that. And I really hope that someone can be reminded of that here while we are in the middle of our walk in the physical. That’s the name of my website and the book that I’m about to finish—A Walk in the Physical—because we’re just going for a walk. That’s right. That’s it. We’re on a walk around the wilderness. We may have forgotten, but we’re just on a walk. And so, it’s important that we remind each other of who we really are and remind each other that there’s nothing to be afraid of.<br>Host: That’s right. That’s beautiful. All right, thank you, Christian.<br>Christian: Thank you so much. Have a wonderful evening. Thank you again for the opportunity. I appreciate it.<br>Host: Okay, thank you.<br>Christian: Thank you.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2021/pre-life-memories,-spirit-realm-&amp;-dispelling-fear-from-our-life-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2021/Pre-Life Memories, Spirit Realm &amp; Dispelling Fear from our Life with Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:03:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why We Come to Earth - Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2-aSwVLGY  <br>17 SEP 2021<br><br><br>Karen Swain:<br>
Doing that was the primary aspect of my life. It was extremely likely that I would go down that kind of trajectory because that's exactly what I wanted to do. How that played out? Well, here I am. It played out in a way that I don't know how it's laid out in comparison to the original review. I don't have full access to it, but we're all doing something like that. We're all nudging the probabilities all the time, not just with our choices and our thoughts but with our intent. Our very expectation is constantly nudging how things will unfold.  <br>We're very powerful creative beings. Consciousness is first; the physical is subsequent to consciousness. So, what goes on in our own minds and hearts is actually very important. That's why shows like this, where we're engaging new ideas and trying to basically realize and feel again that deep love that actually is real and actually exists for us—when we do that, when we touch into that, it's actually part of the solution. You may not see an immediate physical effect, but just that resonance, just the resonance between individuals focusing on that love or facing their own fear or getting past ignorance—some kind of ignorance that's held them up their whole life—somehow, our own journeys that happen internally are a part of the ultimate way to heal our world. The ultimate solution? Consciousness is first. Yes, the physical stuff will happen second.  <br>You've got to relax and situate the positive. I feel good.  <br>You're listening to Karen Swain, teacher of deliberate creation, accentuating the positive, showing you a way to a better life. Accentuating the positive—it's not just a fad, it's sanity. Who in their right mind would accentuate anything else?  <br>Hello and welcome to another show of Accentuating the Positive with Karen Swain. As always, such a blessing to be with you all today. Please remember, if you're liking the shows, to hit that subscribe button and the bell button if you're listening on YouTube. I have started uploading some of my videos to other platforms—just a bit of variety. Odyssey—I'm checking out Odyssey. I'm checking out quite a few different streaming platforms.  <br>I'd like to introduce you to the gorgeous Christian Sundberg. Welcome to the show, Christian.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Thank you, Karen.  <br><br><br>Karen Swain:<br>
One of my friends, followers, listeners—Gloria—sent me an email. I don't know if she was the first time, but yeah, she might have been. She sent me an email and said, "Check out Christian." That was back in April. It's so funny—when I saw you, I had seen you come up on YouTube so many times in the side videos, and I thought I was looking at—what's the guy's name?—Edward Snowden.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
I have not heard that comparison before. Really? Has anyone ever said that to you?  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Your face came up, and I kept thinking it was an Edward Snowden video because it just kept coming up. I think the universe was trying to say to me, "Check out this guy, Christian." And I just dismissed it, thinking, "Oh, it's Edward Snowden." And then, when Gloria sent me your video, I looked at you and went, "Oh my God, that's the guy that keeps coming up on YouTube." So, there you go.  <br>Let me tell people a little bit about Christian. You've been doing a lot of shows of late, haven't you?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yes.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
And you're probably over-repeating your story over and over again.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Oh, it's okay. It's an important story. It's very personal, but it's important to share.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
It is an important story, and hopefully, we'll speak about other things that other shows haven't. But when Christian was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While that memory left him completely at around six years old, for most of his early adult life, it spontaneously returned when he was around 30, as he took up a meditation practice and went through a personal awakening journey. It was around this time he also began to remember his out-of-body experiences.  <br>Can you do those deliberately? Can you deliberately have out-of-body experiences, like sit on the couch and just—  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
No, I can't. But they happen.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, and you started remembering them?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
I think we all have them all the time, but we just have no memory of them. But at this point, when your memories came back about who you were before you came to Earth, you were also starting to remember what you're doing when you're out of body.  <br>Yeah, I began to have conscious out-of-body experiences that were very eye-opening and shocking. That actually began to happen first, and that was very worldview-altering at the time. Wow. And so, as that was happening, I began to have these memories return. They were always there; they were just being uncovered. And I was like, "How did I ever forget that?" It was the most natural thing in the world, but they had been veiled, of course, which is quite natural while we're on Earth.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, it's amazing how much information we're storing in our subconscious that we're not consciously aware of. So much, anyway. You've written a book called A Walk in the Physical, which attempts to succinctly describe the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey.  <br>And you've worked as a project manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing projects. So, what did that entail? You've been pretty sort of left-brain-oriented in your work, was it?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Manufacturing, yeah. So, for 16 years, I worked for a manufacturing company. We manufactured valves and pumps that went into the power industry. For 14 of those years, I was a project manager for the complex projects—the nuclear valve and pump projects. Some were design projects; most were manufacturing engineer-order manufacturing projects. And yeah, it was quite an interesting career—definitely different than this type of material. But actually, I think it was helpful because I was able to use the left brain, as it were, to such an extent that I think that really helped in being able to create a framework for the content in the book.  <br>Which, of course, can't be put into a framework—there's just no way. But I do feel called to try to create a framework, create a context that is helpful—hopefully helpful—for people to understand the place of the human experience within the larger context. It's imperative that we understand that at this time on planet Earth. It's imperative that people start remembering and waking up to the truth of who they are. We can't go on with the forgetting and the—you know, what's going on on our planet right now.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Well, to finish your bio, it says today Christian speaks publicly about his memories as he wishes to remind others of who we truly are beneath the human play. And Christian was just sharing with me that you're no longer doing your corporate job, so you're in between jobs at the moment.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yes, that's true. And we'll see where it leads.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Well, I was just thinking because we had a bit of discussion online about how many times you've shared your story. So, is there any coincidence that so many people have been interested in your story? It's like you put it out online, and it just exploded, didn't it? Like, people are really—it really did, right?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, no, I'm very humbled. I'm just a normal guy, and I don't feel like I'm special. We all have this incredibly rich context, and I've been able to share it. And I've been absolutely amazed at the response of this sharing—this very personal story. You know, when I first shared it, I thought, "Well, five people hear this, and it'll be great." You know, at least I can let it out because I felt for seven or eight years I didn't share this at all. I felt like it wasn't the right time. So, when I first shared it, it was like, "Okay, I've said it. It's out there now."  <br>But I have met so many amazing people. There are so many people out there who have similar experiences. And, you know, we just live in a world—well, we live in a society—which is difficult sometimes to share these types of experiences in a way without sounding crazy. You know, yeah. And it's all—I've been just very blessed to meet so many amazing people. I mean, every day I'm meeting just really, really amazing people. There's so many just very loving, evolved people out in the world. And it's just such a great blessing to connect with them.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Isn't that beautiful that there are so many loving people in the world?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
It is. I think we think the world is dark and terrible all the time because, like, news tends to—you know, our mainstream media tends to focus on the negative. But there's so much goodness out in the world. There really is. And there's so many incredible people. You know, I've been doing this show for like 12 years, but I've been showcasing new and old teachers for about 25 years. There are so many incredible people on this planet. It's just awesome.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
I want to say something to you. We need teachers that don't feel like they're special. Let me tell you—we need teachers that feel like they're like everybody else. I mean, the world needs teachers like that—that you know, that don't think, "I'm any more special than you." Because none of them—I mean, Jesus said the same thing: "All of you can do as I've done." You know, "I'm not special; I'm just teaching you what's possible." We need teachers like that—that don't say, "Hey, I'm special." There's too many teachers in the world that will tell you that they're special. They have thousands and thousands of followers. Yeah, we need teachers like you, Christian.  <br>The real teacher is the spirit that is within you. You don't really need an external person. Meanwhile, we're all just out here in the woods together, you know, out in the wilderness and the weeds. And that's it. We're just all in the weeds together. There's not like—I mean, we're all just here to help each other if we can. But the true teacher is within.  <br>You know, I like to try to constantly remind people that you are your own authority, your own power. And yeah, well, that's what a teacher is—somebody that reminds others that they too are the teacher or that they have access to their own teacher. But yeah, the teacher is the spirit within. But the teacher—that wisdom has to flow through a mind-body, you know, personality complex in order to be expressed in the world.  <br>And to finish your bio, A Walk in the Physical.com is your website. Okay, let's get into your story because it's just amazing, and I know you've told it a million times, and this will be a million and one.  <br>[Laughter]  <br>So, where do you want to start? What happens?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, I'll just dive right in, and please do feel free to interrupt if you'd like and ask any questions.  <br>So, before I begin to describe this, I have to just say that these things are not speakable. There's no language that can possibly articulate our higher natures or the nature of the higher realms from which we come because our true nature transcends duality. It transcends the limited context of Earth. And so, our language is based on our local context. You know, it's the symbols and forms of Earth. So, there's just no symbols and forms, no words I can throw at you that will possibly even remotely touch the richness and the complexity and the beauty of what we really are.  <br>So, I just have to say that up front. So, it's not possible to take any of this literally, and I just—you know, it's important to know. Okay.  <br><br><br>So, I remember a very, very long time ago, before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical. And I was deeply inspired by this being because I could feel from him the quality of his essence, his nature, who he really was. It was like—because there's like a telepathic exchange between individuals. It's not just language; you can actually feel you're part of them, and they're part of you. So, you can feel what they feel and who they are.  <br>And I asked this being, "My goodness, like, look what you are. How did you—what did you do to become this? Like, what could you possibly have done or known or experienced to be this?"  <br>And he shared with me telepathically that he had been physical. He had lived physical lives, and he shared one in particular in which he had suffered from some kind of physical ailment or pain. And this pain lasted for a very long time in his experience. And the way with which he chose to meet his experience allowed a certain refinement of who he was. It allowed a beautiful refinement—is the best word I can think of—a quality of his essence that was empowered and deepened by his knowing this experience and by how he chose to meet it.  <br>And I said, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I am going to do that." I was super—just deeply inspired, like, "Oh my gosh, I want to do that."  <br>And he said something to the effect of—and you know, it's just kind of not negative; it's kind of playful—like, "Yeah, that's what they all say. It's hard in a way. You don't know."  <br>And I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do that."  <br>He said, "Well, go talk to your guides."  <br><br><br>So, I did. And I lived many times, and I had many physical experiences. And I went and found him later and shared with him that I was in the process of doing this. And he was encouraging.  <br>Okay, so the majority of my pre-birth experience memories are of a time somewhat immediately preceding this life, where I had taken a long break. I had done many physical experiences, and I was in a state where I was resting. And this guide kept coming to me and asking, "Are you ready to go back in? Are you ready to go back yet?" Like, every once in a while, just keep pinging me, pinging me. And I kept putting him off for a while, saying, "No, I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not doing it yet." And then, eventually, I said, "Okay, I'm ready."  <br>And when he came to me, then I remember reviewing what I can only describe as like my state, my nature, who I was, and what qualities I knew. I don't want to use the word "developed," but it's kind of like the development of qualities. It's like the knowing, the experiential growth into certain qualities and knowing of certain types of experience.  <br>And when I reviewed this with him, it was very obvious the thing that I needed to do, the thing I needed to work on, so to speak. I don't like the words "work on," but it was clear the type of thing that I needed to engage. And it was this very, very low vibration fear that had completely bested me and overcome me in a past physical experience. And when I saw it, I was like, "Oh yeah, it was very obvious. It's like I've got to do something about that."  <br>So, okay, but I knew even then that the depth of this fear was so extreme that I knew it would be daunting to be able to meet an experience of this very, very low vibration and to integrate it—you know, to really come to terms with it and heal it and meet it fully. I knew that would be extremely difficult.  <br>So, I asked, "Is it even possible? You know, is it even possible within all that is? Has any being in creation ever done something like this—met a fear this low, come to terms with it?"  <br>And the guide said, "Yes, and you have all time available to you to do so. There's no hurry."  <br>And I just knew from that state of being, "Well, if it can be done, I will do it." Like, from a human standpoint, it doesn't feel quite like that to me now because I know right now the challenges of being human and the pains we can have. But at the time, I knew what we are, what we all are, and the true strength and immortality and power of the spirit and the fact that there is nothing to fear. And I said, "Well, if it can be done, I will do it."<br>
So, they brought me a life that was a physical life that was very perfect, very appropriate for this intention. And I reviewed that life, and I accepted that life. And that life was not this life as Christian; it was just before this one.  <br>And I remember accepting the veil. And this is the thing that is most in the forefront of my mind—this experience of—it's very hard to explain. It's like having your true nature obscured from you and diving down from a place of all connectedness and knowing, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, super low into a place that feels separate and there's no knowing. And it's like being super dense and super—like, almost like going to a vacuum of space where there's just no heat.  <br>You know, but I like to describe it like an amplifier that produces a sound pitch. I think this is like the best metaphor. It's like, you know, you're in a very high vibration; your being is connected to all things. And then you turn the knob, and it goes down. And then when it gets to the bottom, you turn it down more, and then you turn it down some more and more, and they keep turning it down more and more and more and more. That's what it felt like—the plummet down, down, down, lower, all the way into the vantage point of being human.  <br>And so, then I was there, and I was only there for a very short time. I was in the womb; I had not been born yet. I was experiencing being a body in a womb. And I said, "I'm not doing this. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I don't know. I lost everything that I am. I'm not doing this."  <br>So, I mustered my might, my strength, and I smoked the veil. I fought my way out; I pushed my way back past it. And I succeeded in doing that, but I became immediately aware that I had killed the fetus that was to be mine. I had inadvertently ended the life.  <br>And I had a life review for my very, very short life. I don't know how long I was there, but even in that very short amount of time, I had made an impact. And I became aware of how I had made the mother's journey more difficult because I had heaped grief upon her. And I saw, like, ripples in a pond away from the mother—hundreds of degrees, like hundreds of other people, and all these degrees out from the mother that would also be negatively impacted because of my fear, like right at the beginning.  <br>And so, from that side, I knew nothing was wrong. You know, because from that side, you can tell it's okay. It's just a play; everything's fine. There's not really a problem; it's just something we come to experience. But I could see very—like, almost objectively—like, "Oh man, I got a lot of fear. I've got to do something about it. This is not what I wanted to do."  <br>I had all these great intentions, you know. I went with all these really complex, wonderful intentions, but I had wasted that opportunity.  <br>So, I spent some time in a room that I call—I'm just calling this a term—like a veil acceptance simulator. It's a place to go where you can practice surrendering to the veil so that you can do it without reacting the way that I did. You know, like, basically, it's like being dunked under deep water in a deep pool and being plunged under the water and seeing how long you can hold your breath, so to speak. But you can cry uncle, you know, if you want out, you just raise your hand or something—not literally raise your hand, but you just call out, and they can light you up because it's just a simulator.  <br>Well, I can tell you that the real thing is more difficult than the simulator. I remember that because I was there for a while.  <br><br><br>And then, eventually, they brought me this life. Okay, so this life was very good. It was good enough, but it was not as perfect as the other one would have been. The other one was a really, really optimal match for what I wanted to experience, and the circumstances and the biology of that life were more appropriate for who I am as a soul. Whereas this life, it was less perfect, but it was good.  <br>And so, I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail. It was like if you laid a tree on its side and reviewed it—it was like reviewing a flowchart with millions and millions of possibilities of what may happen in this life and what it may be like to experience doing this in this life, being this person, Christian. And you know, there were events in there, but it was primarily about what would it be like to be me in all of these different experiences and all these different possible avenues that life might take me.  <br>And I knew that it was very likely that in my 20s—my early 20s—I would experience a trauma that would likely crush me and allow me to re-experience this deep fear that I wished to re-engage and heal. And I also knew many other aspects of the life. I knew that, like, for instance, my parents were very important. I knew that my father would instill confidence in me, and that confidence would be paramount to me having a rock to stand on to meet this fear.  <br>And I knew that it would be meaningful for me to be male, just because the male energy in this case would be helpful for me. And I remember asking some questions, like, I asked, "Is it okay if I be intelligent this time?" Because I knew that—well, it wasn't so much, "Is it okay if I be intelligent?" More like, "I want to be intelligent," because I knew that I had been intelligent in other experiences, and I appreciated that; I liked that. And they said, "Yes, you can do that."  <br>And I also asked, I said, "You know, I don't want to forget everything this time. I just want to remember a small, tiny little bit—just a little bit." And they said, "Yes, you can do that, but that will make the life more difficult." And I knew why it was because the contrast of this life is even greater when it's known in relation to where we come from because there is such a high vibration and so wonderful that being on Earth can be exceptionally painful to have some glimpse of that.  <br>It's one of the functions of the veil, then, to protect us—like, make sure that we don't get so homesick that we can't do anything else. But anyway, so I knew that even that contrast of having that awareness and feeling that extra contrast—I knew that even that—oh, and the sensitivity that would go along with it—I knew that I would have to be very sensitive. I knew that even that contrast—like all contrast—was an opportunity for growth.  <br>And so, I was very excited. I said, "Yes, I'll do it." And excitement is the key emotion. Like, it was just such an exciting process. I just can't express enough how exciting it is and what was—and is—I say "is" because it feels like the memory is not just in the past; it's kind of like right now. It's like a living thing—how exciting it is to be human and also what an incredibly precious opportunity it is because there's only so many slots. There's only so many chances to be a human, and Earth is such a precious place.  <br><br><br>And so, to be given a chance to be human, it's like, "Oh my gosh, it's like being given the most precious gift in the world." Like, this great honor. So, I was very excited.  <br>Okay, so then I remember being in this area. So, I remember there having to be a moment to say yes to the life, and I don't remember that moment, but I remember then being in a waiting area. And then this guy came to me and grabbed my attention, like, "Go now. Like, right now. Now's the time. Now." Like, almost rude—like, kind of like a slap—like, "You've got to go now."  <br>And then being with these beings in this room that I can only describe as like a—it's really hard to explain. It was like a room with a huge shaft—like, it felt like a pit, like a shaft. And below, somewhere below—not physically, but somewhere below—is Earth. And these beings that were there, I can only describe as technicians or tinkerers. They were very mechanical in nature, and they work with consciousness.  <br>And so, they're like mechanical with how consciousness can—with like consciousness technology or something. I don't know how to explain it. And they do this thing where they take the veil and they organically fit it to you. So, like, the body and the circumstances and then the qualities of your soul and who you are—they do this thing where they make it all fit.  <br>So, then I was there, and they asked me one last time, "Are you sure?" Because I knew once I said yes, I was in for the ride. It was like, "You're once you say yes, you're in the roller coaster. There's no getting off the roller coaster. You're in for the ride."  <br>And I said, "Yes."  <br>And then I remember this plummet as the veil came over me again—down, down, down, like I described before—lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. My knowing being cut off, my connectedness to all things disappearing, feeling the quality of who I was like vanishing almost to the place of like nothing—a place of just this very dense, dark, restricted space.  <br><br><br>And so, then when I was there, I just basically this time tried not to fight it because I knew that last time I had fought it, I had inadvertently ended it prematurely. So, I just focused on not struggling, not fighting against what was happening.  <br>And I let it take hold of me, and then I sent one signal back to the technicians: "Did it take? Like, did the veil take?" And they sent one message back: "Yes."  <br>And so, I knew I was here. So, I was super excited. I'm like, "Oh, I made it. I'm here. This is awesome."  <br>Okay, so then I was there for a while, and then I was like, "You know what? I am not doing this. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I am not tolerating this. This is ridiculous. What am I doing?"  <br>So, once again, I began to summon my might to fight my way out when this very holy moment happened for me. From the Great Spirit of God—or whatever word we want to use: Source, the Great I Am of all things—came to me, and it showed me the stars and the universe. And I felt all of it within me, and I felt this churning symphony of bliss within me. And I felt the sun—our sun—like churning and just the love and the beauty of it. And I felt so connected.  <br>And I knew that I was still that. And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this."  <br>That memory is the most holy moment for me because that's what we really are. We are that. And I was like, "Oh, that's still what I am. Oh, that's wonderful. Okay."  <br>Okay, so that called me, and I was able to let go and just be in the womb. And I was okay because then I knew it was okay. It was like there wasn't really a big problem.  <br>So, then the next memory happens of being born. I remember the shock of being born—the physical shock, the temperature, you know, the cold, the touching, the sounds. But I had no understanding. I didn't know what was going on. It was just this very extreme experience of suddenly being here.  <br>And I remember the nurses there, like, touching me and doing things to me. And I remember looking at them and being like, "Oh my gosh, who are these wonderful beings who are taking care of me?" Like, I didn't know anything. Like, I had no understanding. I just knew there was something happening, and I had love for those beings. And I was like, "What is going on?" Like, I felt such intense curiosity. I remember just looking around and being like, "Why is it this?"  <br>And I only have one visual image memory—that's like of the room. I remember where my mother was in the bed and where the heating grate was in the window. And I know that they say that babies can't see a room, but I remember this one visual image quite well. So, I don't know how that is, but I remember that. And I eventually drew the room for my mother when I got older, and you know, she confirmed, "That's right. That's where I was. That's where the bed was. That's where the doctor was."  <br><br><br>So, then as I got older, I used to cheat a little and drop into this memory up until the age of like four and five. By the age of six, I had no memory of this at all. But early on, I remember—especially before the ages of four and five—like, trying to look at the flowchart memory to see what was going to happen, you know, to like kind of cheat and just simple things like, "Who's going to come over to the house tomorrow?" or "What are we going to do today?" You know, just like very simple questions, just asking for so I knew what to expect.  <br>And that ability diminished as I got older. And I also remember feeling very strongly that certain qualities of the other reality would be true here. Like, for instance, I imagined—I assumed—that everybody would be able to feel each other's emotions here because that's very normal in other systems—that we can just share who we are, share our feelings.  <br>And that's not how it works on Earth. I also assumed that people who were in positions of authority or positions of—I don't know—teaching would be loving and wise, you know, because that's how it is in other systems—that beings who are in positions of leadership or teaching or guides are loving and wise. That's not always the case on Earth. We sometimes have leaders who are not so loving and wise.  <br>So, that memory left me completely by the age of five or six, and then I had no memory of that at all until the age of 30. My body is 41 right now. And like I mentioned, when it began to return to me, it was the most matter-of-fact, natural thing in the whole world. Like, "Of course, of course, this is what happened." Like, and it wasn't like a big "aha." It was just like, "Oh, yeah. Why did I forget that?" You know, I was just like, "It was always there, but some leaves had covered it up or something."  <br>Yeah, so I didn't share it for the first seven or eight years. I did share it a few years ago for the first time, and like we talked about already, the response has been amazing. There's a lot of people out there who actually have similar experiences. And it's—I love connecting with those people because I feel like there's this really cool energetic link and bridge that's formed when we can meet here in the physical and still have like a bit of a—when we touch that higher vibration, that higher place, and then touch here, and there's like a circuit almost made that's very powerful.  <br>Yeah, anyway, so that's a quick summary. I have so many questions. I just wanted to get the story. Look, I remember listening to you back in April, and the thing that stuck—I mean, all of it stuck—but the thing that stuck is I thought that the leaders of our world would be loving and wise, and that's not what I experienced. And I remember that stayed in my mind, and I kept thinking about that, like, "Who said that? Who said that?" And then when I was revisiting you last night, I'm like, "Oh, it was Christian that said that."  <br>That statement stayed in my mind—that the leaders of our world would be loving and kind. And like, go figure that the leaders of our world are so not loving.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, and it's pretty natural here because we are in an extreme state of separation by comparison. It's not true separation, but the experience of separation is so deep that there's so much fear and ego that rises from so much evil that rises from fear and so much fear because the constraint is so high that our way of interacting with each other is yet—we have a long way to go to fully actualize our true loving natures with each other.  <br>So, we live in a society that—like, our two real things that we have going—just a high level—we've got fear and ignorance. Too real—like, I say problems, but they're not really problems. But the two hindrances to why we don't have a society that is fully functioning with all love and wisdom as the priority is one, fear—we all have so much fear for making choices based on ego every day—and the other is ignorance—just that we don't remember. You know, we just grab onto all sorts of things and claim knowledge and then go and do all sorts—you know, we then use our fear, and we don't use that responsibly.  <br>So, when you take this to such a degree where our entire society—where we can barely even talk to each other, you know, we can't even communicate—it takes so much effort just to talk. You know, you take that whole context, it's no wonder that we have a weak—we can at times have an inefficient society.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, absolutely. Okay, I'm going to go back to the beginning.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, sorry.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Do you have memory—you probably don't—of where you were before you had physical Earth lives? Like, you know, when you said you met the being, do you remember what experiences you'd had up into that point? I mean, we're talking linearly, and it's not linear, but—  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, it's not linear. Okay, so the only memory I have is that memory where I was in a—okay, so it was like—words are so vastly insufficient. It was like traveling across a green, beautiful landscape—though it wasn't like an Earth landscape. It was like traveling across a landscape with many, many other souls, and we were all participating in one joint activity. We had one shared purpose, and this very evolved being was doing the same thing we were. We were going in the same direction.  <br>And I don't remember—you know, how I can't even tell you what that was—but we had some shared intention that we were moving towards that was—I mean, okay, so on the other side, there's so much activity that is rooted purely in love and creativity and joy—just like joy. So, there's so many ways that we examine that and express that and play with it and use form—which, like, this world is a world of extremely dense form. Form just means objects and things and energies.  <br><br><br>We do all sorts of activities that involve the use of form, ultimately for the purposes of love and joy. So, I don't know exactly what we were doing, but it was some shared activity where this being was with us, and I was like, "Wow, do you feel—how I feel you feel that?" That was how it started. It was like I felt so much joy coming from this being. He shared with me that he did.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, so was he in form? Were you in some sort of—you know, as I try to visualize this because I'm in a human form, I'm thinking, "Oh, you all look like humans," but you probably weren't human at all. You were like points of light.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
At the time, I perceived my own body—for lack of a better word—and the bodies of others as light—as living bodies of light. Right, yeah. So, it's like you're kind of these energy orb-type things, but you understand that you're separate and one at the same time.  <br>But his energy—yeah, you're not separate. It's more like you're individuated and one individual. Right, yeah. You're not—there's no separation, but yeah.  <br>But when it's okay—so like, you mentioned an orb. So, what we tend to do on Earth is we tend to take the objects that we've learned on Earth and try to understand everything from the perspective of less objects. That's all we remember. So, we think of things like, "Okay, what's one thing that I know that I can associate with it? An orb, you know, a circle." That's okay. You know, that's what we do as humans, but that's why these things are so difficult to express because it's not like that.  <br>It's also like the land—you're connected to the land. I say the land—you're connected to the environment and to each other too, and you feel it, and you know it, and it's a part of you, and you're a part of them, and it's all alive and full of energy, and like the light itself is alive. It's very hard to explain.  <br>And there's not just one place either. You know, we like to think of the other side like on Earth—we think there's Earth, and then there's the other side. Well, no, there's actually many, many, many, many reality systems, all with their own constraints, their own rule set, you know, with how we engage them, what we experience. So, I can't possibly from here—I don't know how to relate that experience to everything else. I simply don't have any ability to do that.  <br>I know it's mind-boggling to think of, really. It's absolutely mind-boggling, but we won't get too stuck on that. I could talk about that for about two hours.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Sorry, no, I could, but—I was just thinking of—you know, I had this beautiful woman, Naia Yvonne Ballard, who was an author for one of my books, who just left her body recently. She had the most extensive NDE experience, and you know, she said that often what happened to you often happens where souls kind of go, "Nope, can't do this," and they exit the body either in utero or when they're young babies. And we call that SIDS—often, you know, that's sudden infant death syndrome.  <br>And I've often wondered about that question. I haven't really heard that said many times, so that's interesting that someone else is making that comment. It stands to reason for me, right? You know, because I can't be the only one with a lot of fear. So, it stands to reason that because of the extreme nature of the separation that we experience on Earth—it's so alien—it stands to reason to me that others might react in a similar way.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, this is a really hard world, and coming here takes a brave—like, takes a courageous—again, I'm speaking in human terms, but that's you know, what are you going to do? That's what we've got. That's what we've got to work with. It takes a courageous soul, and some kind of go, "Nope, can't do it. No, no, can't do it."  <br>I remember listening to another woman who'd had a few NDEs, and she had memory of chatting to her guides too. And she said that in this life—she was, I think, in her 50s at the time she was speaking—it was an Iron thing I watched online. And she had died as a child pretty much throughout all her life because she just kind of reached a point where she went, "Nope, too hard. I'm out of here." And you know, there was just like trying to keep her in her body so that she could actually live some sort of length inside the physical form.  <br>I completely relate to that. That's so interesting. I can definitely see that happening.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
And what's so fascinating with what you say is, you know, the more memory you have, the more you experience the contrast, and the harder it is. So, the veil actually serves us in not remembering who we are. It serves us in anchoring us to this physical world and all that we experience as a physical being.  <br>And loving that—you know, loving that we don't remember, loving that word—we feel separated. And yeah, and finding it—it's not—yeah, it's not just that it's harder. I mean, it's also incredibly liberating too.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
No, I don't mean to pigeonhole, you know, that—I don't want to draw a direct correlation that less veil always equals more pain. That's not really because the thing is we're not actually like—we're experiencing being veiled, but we're not actually here all the way. We actually exist on the other side right now.  <br>So, it's not like you're stuck here. And I just want to highlight that because it's not like you should avoid it necessarily. Trying to find out how you are experiencing who we really are is an incredible joy and incredible liberation. But yeah, it does serve a great purpose to help us stay completely grounded, rooted, and focused within the human personality's perspective because that is the value. You know, that's where the value lies—being Karen, you know, being whoever you are today, getting up in the morning and eating your breakfast and going to work and, you know, whatever—going to the bathroom. You know, doing that from your human perspective is valuable.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
It's valuable. Yeah.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, ah—something. Anyway, I lost train of thought.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
When we entered the body—so as you speak about your experience, you're entering the body in utero, and yet some souls elect to like skip the utero process and enter the body when the baby's born. You know, like there's a variety of ways that we can enter this world, right? There's—I think that as I'm listening to your story, I'm chatting to my mob, and I'm thinking, "I guess it depends on the experience of the soul when they're going to enter the body." If you're kind of old hand at this, you can come in and out at will—like, enter, you can experience utero or not.  <br>What do you think about that?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Well, both the experience and the soul of the soul and the qualities and nature of the soul. And also, it's not that you're going into a fundamentally real object called a body. It's more like reaching a vibrational place in which you now engage from that body's perspective—something like that.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, like logging into a video game, maybe.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, and the video game—you log into a video game; you don't have to crawl into a body. You just log on, right? And it's so real at the time you're playing it that you forget that you're not it. Like, yeah, yeah, that you're not it.  <br>And the more that we associate with the content of the video game character—the story, the ideas, the thoughts—the more we do that, the thicker the veil is felt, right? So, like, little children—they're not deeply associated with it yet, so they can come and go a lot easier. When they see things that we don't see, they get there, go out, and come back—no big deal. Whereas us—"Oh, I've got to pay the bills, and I've got to go to work, and I have pain, and you know, this person made fun of me, and you know, all the things"—is constantly cycling those lower vibrational associations tend to make the veil feel very thick, right?  <br>Which is the crux of enlightenment, really. It's what I teach constantly—that when you identify with your human personality-body-mind complex, you suffer. But when you identify with spirit having an experience—"I'm not this; I'm not my thoughts; I'm not my body; I'm not my personality; I'm not my experiences"—and you can don that witness—like, you're like you're watching—you know, you don't suffer. You can actually enjoy the pain. You can enjoy the suffering.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, that's beautiful. I want to help add on to that by saying that that is not a process of disassociation. I can feel some listeners saying, "So, I'm supposed to focus on the fact I'm not my body?" It's not that you're creating a new division. It's more that you—so, I—okay, this is the word meditation. That's what this word comes up. It means spending time with moving your awareness back towards itself routinely so that you gain familiarity with that awareness.  <br>And so, it means then that the thoughts will be less—they won't have the same oomph. And so, it actually is experientially you move in that direction—like, you actually become more alert and much more aware of everything—all the pain, all the pleasure. It is an opening. It is an acceptance of knowing all that is actually here—not a rejection or a division or a new boundary.  <br>I'm just pointing that out. I think it's important.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
And something else that you said during your story is the benefit of experiencing the suffering that we experience here on Earth—like the benefit of it. What—do you want to go into that? Because I've had this conversation with my clients and my tribe often—you know, what's the benefit of suffering? Because as humans, we see the contrast that we experience as something to resist, to hate, to push away, and we don't understand that there's actually benefit in it.  <br>So, when you met this being of light, and he had lived many lives in the human world, and he had suffered much—I don't even know if he was human, actually, but you know—oh, really? So, he could have been human, but I don't know the type of physical life he lived. But anyway—  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Okay, that's interesting. So, oh, so he just led physical lives like in denser reality? It could have been human; it could have been human.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Ah, so what do you see the benefit of the suffering we go through here on Earth?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
So, it's not that suffering is required. That is not the way it is. It's that contrast is a powerful tool, and that's an important distinction because what we're doing is we're entering an experience of high constraint, not an experience of guaranteed pain. Pain happens—most of our suffering, I should say, happens—the differential. Physical pain is going to happen here and there, but suffering—which is the vast majority of our pain—is our own suffering about our context.  <br>That happens because of fear, which is our yet-unevolvingness—just means we have not yet fully integrated an experience of this level of contrast and constraint. So, our own fear gives rise to ego and all the suffering that goes along with all the association with form and all the thinking.  <br>Okay, so I'm saying it that way because I don't want to say the sentence, "Suffering itself is good." That's not an appropriate—I don't think that's a great way to say that. However, suffering, when it happens, can be very useful for several reasons.  <br>One, suffering tends to be a rather efficient way to nudge us in the direction of the growth that is optimal for us. So, if we're afraid of something and we resist it, we're going to suffer a lot. This is true in my own case. I was very—I've known a lot of fear, and fear is hell. Like, you're afraid all the time; you don't even know why. You're just miserable all the time, and everything in your life becomes like a slave to trying to satiate and avoid this fear. That's not—it's a very painful way to live.  <br><br><br>So, that type of suffering is actually like a huge signpost that is pointing you towards the fear that is the root of why you're in pain so that it can be integrated and healed. And why is that valuable? Because if we can fully know that here and integrate that here, there's this expansion of being that takes place that is so profoundly powerful and awesome.  <br>Like, if Source is this—just a crude dualistic metaphor, and we don't even—duality is not fundamental; this is a metaphor—if Source is here, and you can go vibrationally this far away or maybe as far away or maybe this far away—really far away—and if you can integrate this experience and actually fully come to terms with it and know it all the way—like, fully know it in your being, like fully experience it, fully being—then there's this huge growth of being all the way to here now, which is the growth of because love and joy is what we are. So, this growth is an expansion of love and joy—like lasting, permanent, forever love and joy.  <br>And so, the temporary experience of potential hardship is worth the work—worth it for the soul who wishes to know experience—for the soul which is to integrate experience and integrate contrast is powerful.  <br><br><br>So, I guess I mentioned two things there. One is that it points out where we have fear that can be useful to face, and the second is that contrast itself is creative. Like, if you—so here's an example—like, let's say you live your whole life like in a cage—maybe it's a literal cage; maybe it's a figurative cage. You live your whole life in the cage, and it sucks. It's really painful.  <br>Then, when you either in the life when you fully come to terms with it and discover who you really are or after the constraints are dropped and you return to who you really are already—in either case, now you know exactly what it's like to be in a cage, which means that you now fully know what it means to be free—the opposite of what you experience.  <br>So, we come to experience opposites intentionally—not because we're masochistic—but because they are very valuable to actually know.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Neil Donald Walsh tells a great story about this, and I'll paraphrase. There's like a little light in the big light. It's called the story of the light, and the little light says to the big light, "Oh my gosh, I am the light. I am the light." But the light says, "You are the light." And the little light says, "But what does it mean to be the light?" The big light says, "If you wish to know, then I can show you." And the little light is overjoyed. "That's wonderful. How can you show me? How can I know?"  <br>And the big light says, "In order to know what it is to be the light, you must know temporarily darkness. You must know what it is to not be the light." And you have to get so super—and that sounds so super exciting to the little light. But the big light says, "But don't worry, you're always still the light. You'll always still be the light."  <br>And that is a metaphor for a very broad, crude metaphor, but a good metaphor, I think, for the depth of contrast that we sometimes come to experience. I'm saying contrast rather than suffering because it's not just some—there is great suffering as one aspect of contrast. It's all aspects of contrast that are useful in this way—being cold or hungry, you know, whatever. Like, it's all useful.  <br>You know, there's been many metaphors around this topic. Food never tasted better than when you're absolutely starving.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Hungry, exactly.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
And I remember saying to a client once years ago who was a real corporate sort of person—she came for a session, and I said, "All they gave me this metaphor I thought was perfect for her. It's like wearing stiletto shoes that are killing your feet all day, and the relief you feel when you come home and take them off."  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, exactly. And then someone says, "Do you want to put those shoes back on?" It's like, "Well, in your right to say no." And yet, you do. Now I know what it's like to wear stiletto shoes. I'm not—I don't want to do that anymore. Exactly, but now you know forever, right?  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, yeah.  <br>The benefit of contrast—look, it can't be spoken about enough. I remember reading The Conversations with God books when I was a young healer and putting myself out there as a healer—as an energy healer. I'd been a studied naturopath and a masseuse, and now I was starting to see all this stuff and doing all these courses and very unsure about it—like, so unsure about, "Am I making it up? Am I crazy?" You know, just in this place of deep doubt.  <br>And I remember having this epiphany one day and thought, "Wow, if it wasn't for this doubt, I will never really understand that knowing—that confidence and that knowing because I'm experiencing this doubt. Then when I kind of finish with the you know, playing with doubt, I'm really going to understand my deep knowing."  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, because of the doubt.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
All right, okay. You said also that when you were playing with lives—as you were reviewing what lives that you wanted to experience—you basically saw the life kind of completely made before you came into the life.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
No, not completely made. Not completely.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Do you want to just explain that point?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Physically, I write down—are our physical lives pre-made before we live them? Like, but you—it's almost like you looked at everything that was going to happen before you actually—or could happen—probable realities like infinite—and then you said there were many infinite possibilities and probabilities—millions, not infinite, but millions and millions.  <br><br><br>Okay, okay. So, first of all, there is free will, and novelty does happen in the physical, which means choices can be made that were not anticipated, and so outcomes can happen that are—"Oh, wow, we didn't see that. We didn't think that was good. That's exciting. Now we've got to deal with that." That happens.  <br>Okay, so but from that side, what you can see is the full context. And what do I mean by context? Like, the all—because the system knows everything about the play. It's all known—like every prop, everything, every player. It's all known. The only thing that's not known is the free will choice-making that will occur with all the players, and that's a big unknown.  <br>Now, the system knows everybody really, really well, so it's pretty darn good at knowing—guessing—how things will very likely unfold. But it is a probabilistic reality, not a set-in-stone, not prescripted reality.  <br>Now, we do set up certain things for ourselves that may be very likely to happen. I'm careful to say very, very likely and not 100% certain. Sometimes it's very close to 100%, but if we try—if we want to engage something specific, often we can arrange it so it's very likely that we will be able to experience what we want.  <br>For instance, the trauma that I experienced when I was 22 in Chengdu, China—you know, I was 22 years old when that happened, but it happened. Though, interestingly, in my pre-birth experience, I did not see—I reviewed my life even in terms of numerical ages. I remember like going through it not in numbers, like very—almost intellectually, thoughtfully, you know, very detailed, and knowing that it was somewhere in my early 20s—not necessarily 22, but somewhere around there—where the energies would work out such that I would likely be deeply traumatized.  <br>And that it would basically kick me into a spot where I was—I had never been before. Like, it was the same fear, but it was like a new trajectory down a certain vibration that I would have to deal with.  <br>Anyway, so it's probabilistic, and the review of the millions and millions of things was what is likely to happen or less likely to happen depending on what I choose and what everybody else chooses.  <br>And also, there are these energetic themes that are running through both our individual lives and also the collective as a whole. So, humanity goes through like the play has certain acts, you could say. So, and the system knows that. So, there's a lot of energy—so to speak, not physical energy, but like thought energy, momentum—that is built up in the content of these great eras or acts that we are experiencing, and that is a part of what is playing out.  <br>So, and the system knows that too. So, yeah, I think that's the best way I can summarize that.  <br><br><br>Karen Swain:<br>
Would you call the probable realities different timelines?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
I personally would not. I like Tom Campbell—the physicist and consciousness explorer. I'm a huge fan of Tom. I like his model where he describes a database—that's what we call Akashic records commonly—a database where there are billions upon billions of unactualized outcomes that are stored, and there's one actualized thread for what has actually happened.  <br>And what—and because the database is so rich with all the data—you know, like, that means all this—everything, all the sense data, all the everything—it can be gone and experienced firsthand if someone is capable of doing that. And when you review it firsthand, it's very real. It's like going there in person.  <br>And so, I think that—I personally feel that the idea of all like infinite timelines is maybe—because I don't know for certain—but it may be because people are engaging the Akashic records and seeing they're super real. Everything looks exactly real, fully fleshed out, even things that never actually happened, and they think that might be an alternate living reality. But I think it's more like stored for the purposes of learning.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
So, why ask that question is I've spoken with many people who—both in childhood and in their adult life—have been contacted by angelics or extraterrestrials where—usually in their childhood—where they were shown probable realities of Earth, right? And then given a message like, "If you guys—you've got to fix your world because you're going down this trajectory. You know, you get there's mass destruction in your future and chaos, but it can be—you can change that by changing the way you're living your lives."  <br>So, and so they've shown sort of different probable realities—different timelines.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, so what do you want to say about that?  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Well, that's what I just described basically—is that there are these branches, and the choices that we make influence what branches actualize. So, we all individually are doing that, and then every individual is a part of the collective collectively doing that. That's very much what I was describing in my pre-birth experience. It was a probabilistic flowchart of all—you know, what was seen that would probably happen—right? So, that I would know what it would be like to be me and so that I would see the opportunities.  <br>I knew that past my mid-20s, I would be entering a—this is hard to explain. Okay, so imagine like—this isn't directly your question, but it's just a pertinent point—this is just a silly metaphor, but if you imagine that where you start is at home base in the middle—like a campground or something. You're a camp; you go back to home base, and then every time you journey out, you go so far in a certain direction—like, well, maybe you'll do it like circular like this, you know, like maybe go in a different direction.  <br>In this life, you might go really far out this way, and this life feeling might only go a little bit this way. Honestly, well, in this life, I was going very, very, very, very far in one direction—like way past my previous furthest stake. Like, there was a stake in the ground how far I'd gone. I was going to go 20 miles past that one, and because it was so far in that direction, I knew that it would be incredibly difficult for me.  <br>Yeah, anyway, so I knew that that was sort of go back to your original point—reviewing that was a primary aspect of my life. Like, it was extremely likely that I would go down that kind of trajectory because that's exactly what I wanted to do.  <br>How that played out? Well, I mean, here I am. It played out in a way that I don't know how it's laid out in comparison to the original review. I don't have full access to it, but we're all doing something like that. We're all nudging the probabilities all the time—not just with our choices and our thoughts but with our intent. Our very expectation is constantly nudging how things will unfold.  <br>And we're very powerful creative beings. Consciousness is first; the physical is subsequent to consciousness. So, what goes on in our own minds and hearts is actually very important. That's why—that's why shows like this and spending time like this where we're engaging new ideas and where we're trying to basically realize and feel again that deep love that actually is real and actually exists for us—when we do that and we touch into that, it's actually part of the solution.  <br>It doesn't—you may not see an immediate physical effect, but just that resonance—just the resonance between individuals focusing on that love or facing their own fear or getting past ignorance—some kind of ignorance that's held them up their whole life—somehow, our own journeys that happen internally are a part of the ultimate way to heal our world. The ultimate solution? Consciousness is first. Yes, the physical stuff will happen second.  <br><br><br>Karen Swain:<br>
God, I've got so many things going through my mind as I'm listening to you talk, Christian. I'm just thinking about my daughter, and as a parent—have you got children?<br>
Christian Sundberg:<br>
I do. I have two children.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
How old are they right now?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
They are 12 and 10.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
So, they're little.  <br>There was some parts where my daughter—she's 30 now—was going through some really dark nights of the soul—really trauma. And you know, the trauma that she was going through, she was doing to herself, but she was in a really bad place. And I kept reaching out to my guides, "What can I do to help? What can I do to help?" And they said, "She's choosing to go through this. This is part of her experience, and she's learning from it. Don't try and fix her; don't try and save her. Just remind her that you're there for her if she needs you."  <br>And it was the hardest thing to watch as a parent—to watch your child's suffering. But at the same time, you know, as she's come through it, she's so much better for it—so much wiser, so much—yeah, so much more fearless and just wiser for the experiences.  <br>And yeah, so I kind of feel like it's the ego that denounces and rejects. Now, if there's some experience—I don't say that lightly because I know there's a lot of very, very extreme suffering happening in the world right now. I know that. Like, I can't imagine—as an example—losing one of my children, right? And there are people who lose their children, and then I can't possibly know how do you come to terms with that?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, but still, yeah, if we are rejecting reality, it is a vehicle. It's a fear. Yeah, and so it's very important that we learn to meet reality exactly as it is and fully feel it and accept it. And when I say feel it, I mean like everything you actually feel—feel. If you're mad, you're mad; if you're sad, you're sad. Feel it all.  <br>But the feeling—not just the story. It's too easy to get wrapped up in story, story, story, story, story. I'm talking about find out what however reality is arriving to you. Look at it with open eyes. Be willing to feel it and know it, even if it feels hard at the moment. If we do that, those hardships that seem so terrible—those dark nights of the soul—we can very much expedite—not that we're trying to get past them because you can't have the mindset, "I'm going to—I don't like this, so what do I do to fix it? I'll open myself up to it."  <br>That's not the mindset I'm talking about. I'm talking about being completely willing to honor and feel it no matter what it is—whatever your life situation has been—accepting of it. And when you do that, whatever it came to teach you—so to speak—whatever it came—whatever vibration it's offering you—much more easily is integrated and processed and experienced when you let yourself experience it right without fear. Like, you don't have to be afraid.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, there is nothing that we need to be afraid of.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Spirit keeps agreeing. I get—I hear these little sort of like—it's almost like someone clapping. There's they sound like sort of computer glitches, but they're like every time you say something really poignant, spirit goes, "Yeah, good one."  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
It's like a high five.  <br>You know, I have a friend—a beautiful friend who's older than me, and she has adult children. And they're such beautiful, beautiful children—just beautiful-looking, amazing children. They actually live in the States, and she's Australian, married American. Anyway, she had a—she has a son. I had a son—has a son. He went off and just going through his mental trauma—mental trauma. I don't know how to—and he became homeless at one stage, and he wouldn't contact his—you know, she was desperate—you know, desperate and kept asking me, "You know, what can I do? What do you guys say? What do you guys say?"  <br>And the guides kept saying, "He'll be okay. He'll be okay. He's exploring contrast. He's choosing this. He's really choosing this." But as a mother, it was hard to tell her that. She just couldn't. "I need to find him. I need to rescue him." And I and the guy said, "You know, he'll come back."  <br>He did come back, and when he did come back into the family, he only stayed for a short period of time to reconnect with them all, and then he left. Then he left his body. And it was devastating for the family, but it's really—how do you honor that? You know, how do you honor his decisions?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
I think that yeah, it takes an enlightened soul. This conversation, you know, really helps people see—see like honor that life existence because that was the soul was benefiting hugely from that life.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, that can be really difficult for us and for our egos—like you said—to be okay with that. But like you said, just being there for them—like just being present and being a loving, fully accepting place for them to come to if they wish or whatever—just being there is really powerful. Like, just love—any amount of love is like a fuel to help someone deal with their own stuff.  <br>You know, acceptance is like the most—it's all acceptance is like a shelter in which someone can do what they need to do and deal with what they need to deal with, right? And then, of course, we judge, "Oh, that looks so terrible." It can be hard to honor what the real them is doing, right?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
I'm not making light of it. I'm really not like I understand it's very difficult, but like the being that they are does live on. As I love how you reference just leaving the body, and they're not—it's not like they die. I'm sensitive to the words like, "Oh, they died, and we're going to bury them in the ground." No, burying them in the ground.  <br>So, anyway, so it's if we can honor that part of them that continues on, that's powerful. Yeah, because that relationship isn't lost either. Like, the physical thing—the physical may be done for a while, right? And but love is what we are, so those loving relationships endure and flourish even and can be enjoyed further.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
And when I speak with her—because she's not always in Australia, so I don't speak with her that often—I always say, "How is he? Have you heard from him lately?" Like, as if he's still here. And she says, "You know, I've had some dreams with him." But she says, "More than anything, the grandchildren or speak to him all the time. Like, they see him around all the time—Uncle Shahi, there he is." You know, like they've got that's awesome.  <br>So, just to know that just because he's left his body, it doesn't mean he's left the family. I think that there was more of an absence when he was in his physical body and he had left the family than the absence of him leaving his physical body. He's still with the family—very present with the family.  <br>Okay, we could talk about this forever too. I'm going to move on.  <br><br><br>The place where you go to practice forgetting—now, this was just fabulous. The place where you go to practice forgetting.  <br>I was speaking to some—names—people in South Africa, and his name will come back to me in a minute. He channels the archangels, and I was quizzing one of the archangels through him about the astral worlds, and he was speaking about—I said, "When we experience karma, can we work out our karma on like a denser physical-type astral world?"  <br>And he said, "No."  <br>And I said, "Well, what happens there?"  <br>And he said, "Well, you can kind of practice on those worlds what it's like being human. It's kind of like a dress rehearsal."  <br>And so, your story very much speaks to what he was talking about—that place where you can practice forgetting.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, no, it is like that. It's I resonate with what you said about a place on the astral where you can experience a physical—like, you know, it's physical, but it's not. It doesn't have the same constraints as being fully veiled and being fully human. But what I described was not that. It was a veil acceptance specifically. It was about practicing veil acceptance.  <br>I don't think I can describe it more than I have, but it's that was like an exercise in surrender—an exercise like there's a—like a lot of us have a fear of surrender, a fear of lack of control. And that was the energy of what this place was. It was having something come over you—like it's almost scary—and then can you let go to it?  <br>You know, metaphorically, can you let the shark eat you? I mean, it's not like that. I just mean that's like just an Earth metaphor. Something scary arrives, and this was like it was a plummet in vibration, and now you're dark. Oh, and it feels scary. You feel fear rise—fear rises up, and then how do you meet it? And it was practicing the ability of letting go and being fearless and accepting of it.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
How do you think the veil is created? Like, how do you apply the veil? Did you get more insight?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
It's a question that I've asked my guides many times. They said it's involved with the DNA of the physical body and that you can program the DNA as to—you know, how you were talking about the technicians were sort of like fitting it and sort of—and it was specific to each person.  <br>I've asked them this question often, so listening to your story, it's like, "Oh, a bit more of the puzzle piece of the answers to my questions." Like, how does the—how did—how do you make people forget? How can you make this as well?  <br><br><br>Yeah, yep. So, first of all, the veil is—I'll leave you—first of all, leave the DNA thing aside for a sec. That the physical is a different layer.  <br>Okay, so consciousness pre-exists, and the veil is kind of like a consciousness technology. It's like a way in which you can really have a certain perspective so that you can grow through it.  <br>Okay, so how can that possibly work? Well, there is no way for the soul to be bound against its will because the soul is sovereign. It's a part of Source. There's no greater authority. There's not like—you know, it's not like here on Earth where somebody can throw you in a cage or something, and you can't do anything about it. No, you are powerful. You are a sovereign, free-willed being.  <br>So, in order to be veiled, the only way to be veiled is to allow yourself to surrender your own self to it. And then that—I call it a technology because I don't know what other word could possibly speak to this—but it's like a technology that has developed even—I can say over time. The universe is not the first one where a veil has been used.  <br>And they—these technicians do the thing then. So, when so you—so they're like the mechanics or the appliers of this veil technology. They're like super, super good at it.  <br>And so, I don't know what DNA might have to do with it, but I do know that with the meeting of the body and the circumstances with the spirit, they made it all fit. Maybe there's some kind of physical effect on DNA. You know, I'd be postulating.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Well, all physical structure is first created in a subtle structure. So, there are subtle energy forms of the DNA. So, there's like spiritual DNA, if you like. Some people have called it spiritual DNA, where you're designing energetically what you'll experience physically.  <br>And then that, you know, creates the physical—what we look down a microscope and call physical DNA.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, so it's all sort of connected like this—just layers, different layers of the one energy. Physical is just another layer of energy.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, physical as a surface layer.  <br>You know, like, of course, you get one gene from each of your parents in each of the DNA segments. And I—they're—I—it's not—I don't think it's a very helpful to try to correlate that directly with, but I agree that there is a like a programming or something like a mating might be a better word of the spirit with the physical in a way that facilitates its success.  <br>And so, your soul and like the qualities that you are very much do influence the physical and shine through the physical. And the physical, of course, is a part of you now, and it influences what your experience, of course.  <br>So, like, if a different soul was to use this body, it would not have—it wouldn't be the same. But I don't—I don't know though. I mean, I didn't review anything about that. I didn't—I don't have any memory of like multiple beings reviewing one's one body.  <br>I do know that this body—sounds kind of funny—but I do know—remember—I do remember knowing that this body had a certain limitation that other bodies don't, and because of it, other—I knew that other beings would just likely pass it up. They wouldn't prefer to be this human because it would make the day-to-day experience hard.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
The human that you—that you are today?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, this body—this body right here.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
You thought that other beings—so was there an option for other beings to—  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Well, that's what I'm saying. I don't—I don't know, but I know because of that memory, I suspect that it could be used by others. But the thing is that every opportunity—okay, the guides are really good at looking at all the opportunities—you know, all the avatar slots or something. You know, that sounds silly, but it's true.  <br>Look at all the opportunities, and then they can feel there's an incredible energetic evaluation. It's almost like they can review beforehand a lot and then review you and your intentions, and they know how to fit it all. They're like, "Oh, that might actually work. That might—hmm, that's interesting."  <br>It's part, you know, and as for difficulty, you know, sometimes they—you know, guides might even have different ways to guide you. But in general, you know, they try to help you not bite off more than you can chew because usually it's us wanting to bite off even more because we know how much expansion is possible.  <br>But they, so they usually try to guide you into a way that is helpful—like the most helpful for you that they can be and to optimize your chances for success.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, yeah.  <br>Oh, gosh, we've been going for over an hour. There's so much to your story. What else did I write down that I wanted to talk to you about?  <br>Beings who've mastered or graduated life in the human experience universe are like gods in other systems. Like, would you—I loved that. That was fabulous.  <br>So, when you do come to Earth and have difficult lives or lives of contrast, and you master that or graduate, you're kind of like—you're like a god in another system—like a more highly evolved system that doesn't have as much extreme contrast. You're like the ascended masters in other worlds, right? When you've kind of graduated Earth school, those were the—that was the language of Bob Monroe that I borrowed there. He described a graduate of the physical universe as being like God in another thought-responsive system.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Well, if you imagine—okay, so we are consciousness, and so as we refine the quality of what we are—and that means as we integrate experience and master all the aspects of being—conquer, you know, overcome fear and learn how to express love in rich ways, real genuine ways—as we improve the quality of our intent—that's like the key of all of this is the quality of our intent based in love or fear.  <br>As we learn to do that, then that means when we are now applying ourselves into a reality system that is far less constraining because we've been able to wield a certain intent here in these contexts and come to terms with certain very, very dense experiences. And when we are in those less concerning environments, what we can do by comparison is extreme.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
I also heard you quote Seth—one of my favorites. One of the first books I've ever read. Physical life is like a bright light that you just can't look away from, but you can.  <br>Ah, okay, let's apply this knowledge to what we're going through on Earth at the moment. You know, my guides were saying through me the other day that what's happening on planet Earth with the controlled drama and the you know, the deadly virus and all the sort of stuff—it's not creating fear; it's revealing fear.  <br>They were saying that if you're scared of spiders and somebody shows you a spider, your fear will be revealed. But if you're not scared of spiders and somebody comes to you with a great big tarantula, you'll say, "Oh, let me pet it." You know, like the fear isn't there if you're so—what's happening in our Earth—on our Earth—so there's a sort of rollout of the propaganda of this virus that's going to kill you.  <br>And so, there's fear arises because you don't want your fear of getting sick or fear of dying, and then there's a new fear that's arising as they're mandating, you know, this certain allopathic treatment that those who don't choose it—there's huge fear in the community that they will be outcast. They will be, you know, there's just so much fear arising.  <br>So, how—those are all surface contexts, not with not fear itself. Like you—like you pointed out, fear of spiders isn't the spider isn't the fear. Our fear gets prompted, and fear just means the—I didn't interrupt you. I'm just—I'm sensitive to calling those things fear. They are neutral context—just like everything else in our world. We apply the meaning.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
So, what do you mean it's a neutral context?  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
So, if you're scared of—if you're fearful of spiders, that's not fear.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
So, no, so a spider is neutral. Yeah, it doesn't necessarily prompt fear, but if you're afraid of it, you will respond in fear, as you pointed out.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
So, I'm just saying that the coronavirus situation is just an element of our context—just like every other element in a world that's had drug abuse and heart attacks and, you know, and beautiful sunsets and all the things that exist in our world. It's all a context of form, and the form itself is not fundamentally charged. We apply the meaning to it. We respond in love or fear, and we buy into meaning about those things.  <br>So, I'm just highlighting that because I think it's important to not immediately associate some specific context with it being fear. You know, that's not—there's no—like an evolved being will respond even to great challenges without fear.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Said that again—a very evolved being will respond to very great challenges without fear, right? With love. And it's okay that the context is whatever it is, right?  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Like Byron Katie, who I feel like is like one of the most evolved people on planet Earth—you know, she doesn't suffer anymore because she doesn't believe her stressful thoughts. So, when context happens, as you call it, she gets cancer. She goes, "Wow, I haven't had cancer before. This will be interesting." She goes blind. "Oh, I've never been blind before. This is going to be a fun ride."  <br>So, she responds to the context without fear—like it's another adventure, another human adventure I'm having here on Earth—instead of going into panic and worry and fear and dread.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, and I'm not saying that's easy by any means. I mean, I have a lot of fear. I've experienced fear commonly. That's what I'm here to deal with. But I'm just pointing out that it's a very powerful realization because the power is in you.  <br>You know, we don't have to assign our power to the context. "Oh, there's this coronavirus."  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
As I'm watching life unfold on planet Earth at the moment, and I'm thinking about our authority systems—you know, the police, for instance, which is an authority system—we use fear to make humans do stuff. So, let's just look at what's currently happening in Sydney, Australia, at the moment. We are in lockdown. We cannot exist. We cannot go five kilometers away from our home, and if we do, we get put in jail or a $5,000 fine.  <br>So, then people are obeying these rules because they're fearful of having a $5,000 fine or being put in jail. So, they're actually obeying the rules. They could be obeying the rules out of fear, or they could be obeying the rules out of peace and love.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Well, you could—I'm just thinking about my experience. Like, my daughter's just arrived—no, I just mean all of it. I'm just trying to—I'm just trying to say that—well, I'm thinking about my experience. My daughter's just arrived back from being on a boat for five months, sailing the coast and up and down the east coast of Australia, and she's just arrived back, and she's more than five kilometers away from me.  <br>And so, if I go to pick her up, I'm going to be breaking the law, so to speak, and then I'm thinking, "I could be thrown in jail for that." Will I do it? Actually, I'm a fearless person, and I also know that I can kind of fly under the radar. But I could do that, and no police is gonna—if you're not too focused on what can happen, it doesn't happen.  <br>But it's just—it's just there in my face at the moment in all our faces as we go through what's going on planet Earth. So, it's an option. Yeah, I'm just highlighting—I don't make light of that. I'm just highlighting that the fact that you will get a $5,000 fine if you get caught more than five kilometers from your house is just an aspect of context right now, right? It doesn't automatically—it's not negative until you decide it's negative.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, yeah.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, or being thrown out. And then when we look at that, we go, "Oh, that's—I don't like that." You know, and then we—and then our ego rises up, and then we're part of the problem because, like, you know, we like to blame the authority structures. Well, the authority structures are just other people—you know, lots of other people making choices based on systems that have developed over hundreds and thousands of years.  <br>But we're a very young species—a very immature species—and like we already talked about, our leadership is not necessarily the most evolved and loving all the time. So, you've got a very imperfect system, and that's just—you know, that's just how it is right now.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, that's okay. It doesn't need to be—like, we don't need to assign our power to this great—like, I'm generally someone who is—I'm not a conspiracy theorist in general, just like as my personality type. I feel that in general, we there are a lot of people in the world who are doing either their best or they're overcome—you know, by their own fear and their own challenges.  <br>And there's seven billion of us doing that, and that's what's happening. You've got lots of—it's a very constraining system where we feel very separate from each other. So, that means we're going to make all sorts of contexts that are potentially challenging for one another. Yeah, we're going to treat each other poorly even if we don't mean to.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Right, because if you—I think I think of that often as I look at our politicians. You know, they create more and more restrictions and lockdowns and laws, and I just see—like I said to my neighbor, "If you look into the eyes of our premier—who's a woman—even before any of this stuff happened, all I could see was huge amounts of fear in her eyes."  <br>Like, I said, "I can't look at that woman. All I can see is fear in her eyes." How she rose to a place of power and politics, I never know. She's obviously very intelligent, and now she's placed in a position where she is on television every day telling Australians what they can and can't do. And the poor love—I actually feel really sorry for her.  <br>So, a lot of people are calling her the devil, and you know, they're demonizing this poor woman, but she's just someone living inside a lot of fear with a lot of responsibility on her shoulders.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, so when the journey is over, you might query the—or even not—or even before the journey's over, query the database. I'm just pointing out that it's not—it's not just that there's always a—we're always applying interpretation. So, it's possible that some of our leaders—and I think in many cases, it's true that many of our leaders are just trying to do their best to, you know, limit the destruction of COVID-19. It's not about limiting freedom, but a little freedom.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
So, then there's a choice. Well, they're—yeah, they're doing their best because they're believing the narrative. And if you believe a story, then you do your best to try and overcome it. But if you don't believe a story, then—  <br>I have a—I can't say a friend—she was an acquaintance. She was a healer, and she was a homeopathic naturopath, and she used to avoid all toxins. Like, you couldn't offer a cup of coffee or any food that was made with not organic food. Like, she avoided toxins her whole life. She was very strict about her health regime, and she taught that.  <br>And then she got cancer, right? And I remember speaking to her and her husband—who was a filmmaker—about her journey, and nothing that she applied to her own health helped her with her cancer. And so, she went to have chemotherapy, and she said, "The irony of sticking my arm out willingly to get an injection of a cocktail of poison in the name of health when I've tried to avoid poison all my life." You know, the irony in that.  <br>She did end up leaving her body, but she got the lesson in all of this—that it's not what we avoid—you know, what we resist—that kind of makes us healthy. It's what we embrace, really. It's how we love and what we embrace.  <br>And she was talking about being in the clinic and them offering her a cup of coffee, and a friend had said to her, "Oh, you wouldn't have drunk the coffee." And she said, "A cup of coffee offered with love is so much more healthy than avoiding, you know, the coffee." You know what I mean? Just—she got the lesson.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, she got the lesson. It was really interesting. But she believed that the poison—that life was poisonous and that that would make you sick. She believed that story, and so she lived her life according to that.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
So, if we believe a story—call it conspiracy theory or not—if you believe a story that you're in danger, that you're going to act accordingly.  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, our whole human experience—well, not the whole human experience—that I'll say that the vast majority of humans experience a deep story—a story, you know, like the life on Earth is a story, right? And the story is really paramount to what's happening because whatever you end up believing about yourself and about the world is how the world will appear back to you and what you will end up creating both.  <br>So, our stories are super important and powerful.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Yeah, it's all of it, isn't it? And love is the power.  <br>Oh, darling, I've been talking for almost an hour and a half. Is there anything else you'd like to leave with us before we finish this conversation?  <br>Christian Sundberg:<br>
So many more things we could say, but I hope that this really unpacks what life before life and life is all about for people. Just—I'll just make one—I can't possibly unpack all of it. No, no, no individual can, but just one comment to anybody who is listening: Please be reminded today that you are so deeply, deeply, deeply loved. You are so precious and so loved, and you are seen and known and understood right now.  <br>You may not be able to feel it all the time because that's part of the human experience, but to that, I want to just remind you: You're not human. You're having the experience of being human. You're the you that feels like you to you. You're your soul. You're you knowing what it's like to be a human. There's an important difference there.  <br>So, it's okay to not get so wrapped up in the story—you know, the context, all these things of what's happening in the world, what's happening to me. We can put that aside and deeply experience how reality is arriving to us and know that we are not just the story. We're not just the human.  <br>So, I hope that that's helpful because, I mean, when you know that, you know there's nothing to fear. So, please be reminded of that too. There's nothing to fear in this life.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
Beautiful.  <br><br><br>You know, I had Michael Tamura as our guest teacher in the Inner Sanctum at the beginning of the year, and I asked him the same question. I said, "Everyone's talking about what's going on in the world, and you and Rafael—his wife—do a radio show every week, and you don't mention it once. Why don't you mention it?"  <br>And he goes, "It's just more of the contrast of life, isn't it? It's like, it's just what we come to experience here on Earth. It's the contrast. It's like that's what happens. People get sick; people suffer. It's just more of the same. You know, no reason to really speak about it and mention it because, yeah, we can transcend anything that's happening on Earth when we remember."  <br>We can transcend even being limited within five kilometers of our home or whatever other—I have to say, as I thought about getting in the car and driving, I wasn't too worried about it, but it was a thought. You know, "I'm not supposed to do that. I could get pulled up by the police. I could get thrown in jail. Oh well, that happens."  <br>I would do it anyway. Like, I would do it anyway. If they want to put me in jail for going and picking up my daughter, then let that happen. Yeah, I would do it anyway. I wouldn't let fear stop me. Fear rarely stops me. I think I've transcended a lot of fears in this lifetime—few to go.  <br>Thank you, gorgeous. Thank you for the opportunity, Karen. I really appreciate it.  <br>Karen Swain:<br>
What a beautiful conversation with Christian. Wasn't that gorgeous? I was just having a big chat with him about having somewhere where people can go to engage with him on his Facebook or YouTube. I noticed last night when I was searching him that he has a YouTube channel—his name—but nothing's on there.  <br>And I said, "Start doing some stuff—doing some lives and getting people to ask questions." So, maybe you want to engage with him and follow him on his YouTube channel because the only way you can engage with him at the moment is read his book or send him an email.  <br>So, the book—if you look, he's actually provided it free on Google Books on his website. Obviously, if you want the physical book, you have to pay for it on Amazon, but he's actually provided a link on his website to get the book for free to read it on Google Books.  <br>I was trying—I did that last night, but I like to get my computer to read me the book so I can multitask, but you can't do that on Google Books. You have to actually sit there and read it.  <br>Starts like if they send me a PDF, then I just get the computer to read it to me so I can watch the dishes and do what I need to do.  <br>Yeah, a beautiful conversation. I hope you got a lot out of that conversation. We touched on some interesting parts, but basically, if you are less engaged with this reality being your truth, you can actually witness it from love and understanding—even the huge contrast that we're experiencing now at the moment.  <br>And I got this long email from someone this morning who's been seeing the control that's been rolled out, and she's just in dread and fear. But dread and fear don't exist when you're, as Paul Selig says, when you live in the upper room. And living in the upper room just means in contact with your soul—in contact with that part of you that is eternal. That's the spirit—the spirit of you, the soul of you, the higher self.  <br>And you understand that no matter what happens in this world, you are not what happens in this world. You are experiencing it for the benefit of the contrast. And how is it serving you? How is what is happening in this world serving you? How is knowing that you could get sick and die serve you?  <br>Interesting, isn't it? If you think, "I can get sick and die," then you start to appreciate the moments that you're not sick. Like, you start to appreciate the now more. There's huge benefits to the contrast we experience.  <br>And yes, it would be good if we don't experience as much fear in this world. That's what we're all here to do as light weavers—to lessen the fear that we're all living under and to move from fear to love.  <br>But as you move out of your fear and into love and into your—into an intimate relationship with your soul, your inner truth, your inner being—a part of you that knows—the part of you that doesn't fear—then you are a huge benefit to this world as you start to emanate love. Then that love wakes up other people to the love inside them, and that they don't have to be fearful either—whether you're scared of being ostracized because you're making different choices.  <br>Fear creates separation, and love unifies. So, stay loving. Love is the power. Love is the power. Love is the power. And Christian's story is really a beautiful example of how love is the power.  <br>All right, I'm going to play chat too much more. My daughter's coming home after—after—she doesn't live with me, but she's coming here after being months and months and months out to sea on an expedition. If you want to follow them, follow the Barefoot Captain on Instagram, and she's a new nerf fist on Instagram, and she posts all her beautiful photographs of her underwater adventures, above water, and her sailing adventures—new nerf fists.  <br>And how does she spell it? You know, I'll put the links underneath, and the Barefoot Captain is the boat that she's on—Barefoot Captain Dean, the Barefoot on the Barefoot. So, they've just arrived back from 110 days out at sea, and she's coming here soon. So, I'm going to go and squeeze my daughter for the first time in months and months.  <br>And remember to—who's coming up in the Inner Sanctum? I'm not sure. Go to the website; check it out. I'm not sure who's coming up this month. Let me just check the calendar, but I'm online every week.  <br>And if you haven't checked out the book Awakened by Death, please do so.  <br>Big love to all of you. Bye for now.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2021/why-we-come-to-earth.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2021/Why We Come to Earth.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:01:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Gift of Being Human – Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>A Gift of Being Human – Christian Sundberg<br>
<a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo2VRulzPGM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo2VRulzPGM</a>  <br>27 JAN 2022<br><br><br>Oh, you're sideways. Oh my God! What do I do about this? Hello. There you go. Hello. Hello, how are you?<br>
I'm good, thank you. How are you?<br>
Fantastic. Living the human dream.<br>
We are all very brave. We are all very brave for being here. I really hope that people who hear this can be reminded of who they, who we really are. You know, if we can do that while we're here, it's the coolest thing!  <br>You know, we really can use this life so much for the better if we have some sense about who we really are. I feel because we can be more loving, and we can be more fearless, and we can grab life, you know? We don't have to be afraid. That's something I'm going to explore with you today.  <br>Okay. Great. Wonderful. Was there a particular moment or something you always remembered since childhood? Can you please tell me about that?<br>
Yeah. I had no memory at all of my pre-human life between the ages of like 6 and 30. At the age of 30, I took up a long-term meditation practice. I was meditating every day, and I didn't expect anything, but I began to have non-physical experiences that were very brief at first but very eye-opening, very shocking.  <br>As that began to happen, I also began to have this memory return, but I realized I had remembered it when I was a kid, and I had forgotten it, you know? I knew it was there before. So, it was just like getting uncovered, and, you know, it was so natural. It was not like a big "aha" thing. It was like, "Oh, that's always been there. I just didn't notice, you know?" It was very normal.  <br><br><br>Have you asked to remember?<br>
No. No, I definitely did not ask. In fact, I'm thankful that I don't remember more because the veil is very helpful. Sometimes I felt called to focus physically so that I can deepen my own veil and be more physically oriented. Because having some of that awareness can be very painful. There's a huge contrast between there and here. It's just so big. So it can really hurt. It can really hurt, you know, to remember some of that.  <br>And I just miss it. I just miss it so much, but I know that this is a huge opportunity. So, I miss it so, so intensely, and some days I catch myself thinking like, "Oh, I just, you know, I wish I could be done," but immediately I reckon, "No, no. This human experience is such a precious, precious opportunity," and so I really want to use it the best while I am here. You know, I don't want to forsake it. It is a huge, huge opportunity. But yeah, having some of that awareness can just be painful because the homesickness is just very real.  <br>How did you say it? Do our best? Use it fully?<br>
Yeah.<br>
What's that for you?<br>
Yeah. Oh, man. I feel so much about this specific topic. There are a few really important aspects to it. One is that we really should do our best to try to meet life with love rather than fear. That's the main theme. And that means in any given choice, trying to make a choice that is based in love and all the things that love means, and not based in fear and all the ego reasons.  <br>And that alone unlocks life, you know? Just trying to act from love and vulnerability, and compassion and humility, and kindness and willingness. Just willingness alone. Just being willing to face our own crap, you know, face our own stuff. Just that alone is so powerful.  <br><br><br>Okay, so that's kind of the main moral idea or ethical idea. But in a very tangible way, I can feel the contrast of the physical. And what I mean by that is that like human life offers a counter pressure or a counter current, maybe. Like if there's a river with a current coming at you, you can swim into the current. It's kind of like that.  <br>Our circumstances are the counter pressure. So all the challenges of our life, you know, the biological context, and the social context, and the financial context, and the psychological context, all the contexts that we're working with and engaging every day, that is the opportunity. In those contexts is the opportunity.  <br>So how can we best use that? It really helps to not fight any of it and just to really, really experience. Really know, really feel all of it. Really allow ourselves to know it and not struggle against it, not fight it. Because even when pain arises, we actually don't need to fight the pain. I know this is hard to say we don't need to fight pain.  <br>Because even pain, when it arises, many times our pain is asking for our attention and our love and our feeling. And I like the phrase, "You feel it to heal it," because when we're willing to really sit with what is in us, sit with what's arising and look square at it without the stories, you don't need all the stories of the thinking mind. Feel. Feel what is there. Then it's very liberating.  <br>Because at first, our fear, because we avoid these pains because we're afraid, you know? We have perceptions that we buy into here that are not in alignment with who we really are. So we may buy into the perception of "I am not worthy of love." It's a common one on earth. Or the perception of "I have no power," or the perception "I am not free," or "I'm shameful." These are really big common themes on earth.  <br>But when we do that, we react in fear because that's not really who we are. Who we really are is powerful, free, we are joyful spirit itself. So when we buy into a perception that is not in alignment with who we really are, we can experience fear. And we're so resistant to feeling that that we lock it away under hundreds of layers of ego and story, and we try to.  <br>And then so much of our lives becomes, "How do we plug that gap? How do we fill that hole? What thing can I get? What drug can I get? What relationship can I get? What, you know, whatever." We seek, seek, seek all the time rather than fully allowing even our deepest fear and our deepest darkness. If it arises, we don't have to go find it. It will arise. If it's in us, it'll arise at one point or another.  <br>And when it does, just being willing to fully feel that and know it. So when you do that, it might feel like a tornado, like a windstorm that's going to pick you up and kill you, smash you. It's so painful, it's so fearful, it's so dark. It will just crush me. Well, it will feel like that, maybe. But after the tornado picks you up and throws you around and you hit the ground, you realize not only are you still there, you are free now.  <br>Because now the pain has expressed, and the wind loses its momentum and it can go away. And then it's just peace, and the joy that was always you is what's left. Joy is always on the other side of that which we fear.  <br><br><br>Okay, so this thing – being with the fear, right? So how long do you actually stay with the fear? So something transforms? How many minutes?<br>
Oh, that's a good question. Okay, so I experienced a trauma when I was 22. That was extremely traumatizing for me, and I had post-traumatic stress for 7 or 8 years, and I couldn't even remember my life before the age of 22, really. That's how traumatized that was.  <br>So it took me years of... I went through counseling called EMDR therapy, it's a form of counseling. And I found fear layer after fear, after fear, down, down, down, down, down. And every time I found a new fear, I thought, "Oh, that's got to be the root. That's got to be the real fear."  <br>And I'm saying this as a background because it took me years in earth time to go through all these layers. But... this is important. At the very bottom, the deepest, darkest, most terrifying fear, I only needed to really feel for a few seconds, but I really needed to feel it. But it took years for my ego to even let me find it.  <br>But then once I found it, it was breathtakingly low vibration, very fearful, but I didn't... when I found it, I just let it, and then after it's known, it's not... it's okay. You're still there, it's okay. Like, you're being... I'll put it this way: your consciousness, your being is deeper than the deepest fear.  <br>Wow.<br>
So it doesn't take long. Now, maybe it'll take more than a few seconds, maybe a couple minutes or something, but it's just about the act of being with it and honoring it and knowing it that can heal it and release it.  <br>Now, like I said, the ego covers it up, so it's not like you can just go sit down right now and say, "Okay, I'm gonna go face my deepest fear."<br>
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.<br>
But when you're willing and when you really are ready to do the work, so when you're ready to do this, the universe wants to help you because this is part of what we're doing here. Spirit will help you to face, to heal, and to face your crap.  <br>So when you're willing to really own your own issues, they will come up for you as you're able to handle them. The deeper parts of you know what you can handle now. So you'll get the next idea, which will be very, very, very hard, but that's okay. That's a good, important step, and it just happens very naturally as long as you're willing to always face and feel and not run away from you, from yourself.  <br>I say yourself because it's not the true you, the real you. There's nothing to run from in yourself, but in your own psyche, I mean, in human personality. The human personality gets identified with the story very deeply. And so we need to be willing to own our role in our own story. When were we the bad guy? When have I been afraid? How have I not been loving to the person next to me?  <br>Like sometimes someone will have a theme in their life, and someone will tell them, maybe 5 or 6 or 7 people, especially romantic partners. It seems to be where it's most easily discovered what your problem is. Your weakness gets shown to you, and most people go, "Oh no, that's not my problem." Well, if you really listen and feel and own it, then you'll have the opportunity to do that.  <br><br><br>Is it always safe to face all the layers?<br>
Yeah, always, always, always. Always safe. We are never not safe. The perception of being in danger is local to earth. It's something we learn because we're biological, and we see a world where the body can actually be killed. It's very, very extreme, right? And we feel pain, physical pain, you know? Somebody stabs us, my goodness, that really hurts, so I'm afraid of that.  <br>So we live in a world where we're kind of conditioned, not only in our lives but even in our collective consciousness over the course of thousands of years of evolving in this world. We live with the idea of danger very deeply, but truly there is nothing that is actually harmful to us, to who we really are, to our spirit. We can't actually be harmed.  <br>We may experience lots of pain temporarily. We may even be deeply damaged human personality for a while, that's possible. Many people get very damaged. But who we really are cannot truly be damaged. Who we really are is always free and full of all life – life with a capital L. And we always are healed in the end. There's no such thing as true damage.  <br>So because of that, when pain arises, we don't need to be afraid of any of it. <br><br><br>Do you remember it in your everyday life? Do you remember this? That you are all of this!  <br>I often forget. I have a sticky note above my computer. I wrote on it while I was in a state where I truly knew that this is all an illusion, and I wrote, "It is an illusion," on the sticky note and I put it above my monitor. And there must have been 200 times since then, but I look up and go, "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it's an illusion," because I get pulled back in like everybody else.  <br>You know, we get pulled in, pulled in, pulled in. That's normal. That's the way this world is to be, you know? We are immersed in the human character.<br>
I love that you wrote that note from that state, you know? So you kind of get that energy together with the note. It's not just a sticky note.<br>
Exactly. I love that. I knew that I would forget.<br>
Yeah, right. Because we all do, right? We all do. We are all in a state of forgetfulness to some degree while we're on earth, you know? That's just how it is. That's almost required for the earth experience because it's impossible to remember all that freedom, beauty, etc., and go through this, right?  <br>You wouldn't be the human you if you were the larger you. If you want to be the human you, you have to be the human. You gotta be the human. You gotta be in the perspective of the human. You have to forget all the rest and just be you, be Anya, be whoever is listening to that. You need to be this character that you think has your name, and, you know, you're a male or female, and you have a job or whatever. You know, you have to really be in that perspective, and that is the value. That's where the value lies, is in the rich context of being that character.  <br>And then later, when you're done, you can honestly say, "I was that. I was that human. I know what it's like to be in pain. I know what it's like to be forgotten, or to be treated poorly, or not have money to buy things, whatever. I know because I did it. I was there. Like, I really was that." That requires you to really be failed so that you can deeply be in that perspective.  <br>What was so fascinating is that when I heard your story, and your purpose was to come into this body to go through a specific type of fear, and that is the reason why all of this exists for you. Because we go for all these big things like, "Who am I?" and all of those: "I have to accomplish one million great things," and actually, actually, maybe that is really simple, that you are here just to have one particular experience.  <br>I don't know, tell me about this?<br>
Yeah, yeah. So, okay. So the human mind likes to limit things because we think of one thing at a time, and, you know, we're really good at thinking about one thing at a time. While the soul is not limited.  <br>So while that was definitely my primary intention to face, and integrate, and heal a very specific low vibration for the sake of expansion, while that was true, it was also so rich with possibility. All experience is beautiful, and all experience is a gift. So being given the precious opportunity to be the human and play the human character and have this experience, it's like, "Wow, what a gift."  <br>So that was my primary intention, of course, but there's so much more to it than just one intention. I will say though, on that topic, and this may be useful for some people, so as the soul evolves, its intentions for life engagement may become more specific. So in the beginning, any experience may be very useful, but then as we develop, it may be very specific things that, "Okay, now I really want to know that. Now I really want to experience that. Now I want to master that," and that just happens naturally as we progress, so to speak.  <br><br><br>Okay, this whole subject of purpose, right? What's that? What is the purpose? What is the purpose, right? The purpose is the expansion of love and joy through the process of evolution, which is the integration of experience and the ability to meet rich contexts like this with love rather than fear. That's one big long sentence, but that's the short. That's the easiest way I can put it.  <br>We're here to integrate experience and grow in love. And as we grow in love, which conquering fear – not conquering is a bad word – integrating that, coming to terms with fear and healing it, is synonymous with love because our true nature is love. So when we're not hindered by fear, love is naturally what we are, and we can shine it more brilliantly, more beautifully.  <br>So the purpose is to have a rich context through which we can make choices and integrate rich experience for the growth, for the expansion of love and joy. It's all about love. And also, we're super creative beings. We're very, very creative, like ridiculously creative. And we're so creative, and we're so bold in our creativity and our joy, that we even do this. We even come to be physical. It's like a work of art. Like being physical is like a living piece of artwork. I'll do that too, you know? It's beautiful.  <br><br><br>How does someone remember their purpose, do you think?<br>
I think that's so personal that I don't think there's any one thing that can be said. But I'll just say two things. Okay, so first of all, I think it's really helpful to gain familiarity with what you really are, which is your awareness itself. Not your thoughts. And that's why meditation can be so helpful for many people.  <br>You know, we talk about meditation like an activity. It's not really an activity. It starts as an activity, but putting aside the time to go look, go investigate what is your living consciousness itself. Go see, just go see, underneath the thoughts. It's okay if the thoughts keep coming, coming, coming. That's fine. Still, keep returning. Feel. What are you really?  <br>Gaining that familiarity with your awareness itself is really powerful because as you do that, the thoughts lose their momentum. As you practice meditation, thoughts lose their oomph. And then the larger parts of you rise up on their own. And so in that, it can be easier to discern what's really going on.  <br>Because while we're really wrapped up in the thinking, the whole world is just to think the thoughts, you know? Like, "I gotta pay the bill. I don't like how this person treated me. Blah, blah, blah." All the thoughts, that's all. That's like our whole life, you know? So we need to give some space and be alert and alive and present in a way that is beyond the thinking. Just be.  <br>So that's the first general comment. The second, more specific comment then is that most people's purpose, I feel, that most people's purpose is kind of made apparent to them because it keeps coming up over and over again in some way in their life. So if we come to deal with something, usually that something is like our biggest problem. Or it's a problem that – oh man, it just keeps coming back and hitting me over and over and over.  <br>I keep having the same feeling come back, or I keep having the same kind of relationship, or I keep having this same relationship with a substance or something, you know? Or there's a physical limitation that I've been dealing with my whole life, whatever. It's not always the case. I'm just saying that many times what we're here to deal with is very much a part of our lives, you know, because we're efficient with how we use our experience.  <br>So it can help to pay attention to the recurring feedback.<br>
That's good advice.<br>
But it's very personal because each person's relationship with the Divine is very personal. Each person, each being is so beautifully unique. Okay, I know when we look at each other, we see relatively similar bodies, you know? We all have two eyes and a head, and we got shoulders and, you know, other things.  <br>Each one of our souls is so unique, like a universe unto itself of new different colors, and sounds, and textures, and motivations, and history, so much history and so many qualities, and personality. Such a unique vibration, just put it that way. Each soul is known in a very, very, very personal, unique, never to be replicated way.  <br>So because of that, I say all that in the context of your question because of that, each person's relationship with the Divine or with themselves, with their Higher Selves, will be unique.<br>
Wow.<br>
One body is young, one's old, one's black, one's white, whatever. It's okay. We all are spirits playing these things. We're like playing characters on a stage. We don't need to... it's the ego that immediately says, "Well, I compared to you am this certain way."  <br>Why does the ego do that? Because now he's trying to claim power. You're trying to claim power so you feel better about this deep, deep fear.  <br><br><br>Another question is about inspiration. I mean, when I heard your story, I was like, "Gosh, this is just such beauty." What is inspiration in its very essence, like to be so inspired to do so much for that? Can you share with me what is inspiration for you and how does it feel?  <br>Yeah, yeah. Because I just think that you are the best person to talk about inspiration.<br>
Oh, thank you.<br>
So inspiration is what we feel when we are connecting back to our true selves. We're reminded of who we really are in a way that... because we really, really, really want to know and return to the total freedom and joy of what we are.  <br>So when we see something that reminds us of that true nature, our true creator or our true creative nature, some aspect of our true nature, when we're reminded of that, we feel inspired, you know? Like you might see a beautiful piece of art or hear a beautiful piece of music. Oh my Gosh, music inspires me deeply, you know? I hear music, and it's like...  <br>We are beings of vibration, you know? Consciousness engages realities through all sorts of different kinds of vibrations – sound, sight, even sight, you know, of course, is colors, is vibration. So when we feel it in ourselves and we feel a certain vibration, it reminds us, "Oh, I am that, you know? That's in me."  <br>It's beautiful. It's ineffable. There's no description for the power and the joy of what we really are. So we are inspired by things that connect us to that or remind us of that.  <br><br><br>How did you meet that being? I mean, how did this moment feel?<br>
Yeah, so the moment you're referencing is in my pre-birth experience. Long time, ancient, ancient times ago, long time ago, before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical, and he was so... Okay.  <br>In those reality systems, at least where I was then, you can fully sense and know the quality of the being of those you are with. Like, that's one of the things that we really love doing and that we enjoy is sharing our quality, feeling each other. And I felt what he was, and he was incredibly powerful, and free, and full of joy, and he had so much wisdom.  <br>And the quality of his nature was just so potent and rich and capable. It's very hard to describe. There's not a lot of good words at all for this. And so I was inspired because I sensed... like I asked him, "How is it even possible that you are this? How is that possible?"  <br>And he shared with me – I'll put it in a unique way that he had used the contrast of the physical. I mean, he didn't put it that way, but what I'm just saying that is what's important to know about it. Is that he had experienced a physical life, many, many physical lives, but in one in particular, he was very damaged. He had a lot of pain, and it lasted with him for years and years. I mean, just terrible pain.  <br>And the quality with which he met that experience allowed him to refine in the most beautiful way – not that the pain did it. It's that he worked with the pain, or his relationship with that moment was still in love somehow. And when he could do that, then what it meant was the substance of who he was was refined.  <br>It's kind of like... this is a very, very crude metaphor, but it's a very simple metaphor. I think it works okay. If you go for a run, you know, you put stress on your body. Your body gets stronger, and then when you go back home, now you are more capable, and you've gone and experienced something that is new, and now the couch is more comfortable in a way that it wasn't before, and you're stronger. You have more stamina, and you have more... like the body of what you are is just has been grown.  <br>And lifting weights is kind of like that, you know? Like, why would you ever lay down and push up a heavy object? Why would you ever do that? That sounds crazy. Well, it's because the contrast, the weight, the counter pressure of the weight makes your body respond in a way.  <br>So consciousness is kind of like that, where we engage the experience of contrast, and that contrast itself is the counter pressure through which we can grow if we were able to respond in love and if we were able to accept and integrate that experience.  <br>Sometimes we don't do that. Sometimes we respond in fear, and fear takes over, and we resist, and we fight, and we struggle, and then we don't make a lot of progress because this is hard, you know? Earth is super high contrast, but anyway.  <br>This being, he most certainly had done that. He grew in the most beautiful way. And I was very inspired because I was like, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I want to be that, feel that, know that." And so that set me down a very, very long path.  <br>And I had mentioned this story several times before. I heard this, but I'm reminded now of something that Bob Monroe, the famous out-of-body explorer, said. He said something to the effect of, "Many of us come and begin to go through the physical incarnation process because we come across a being who has graduated from the earth experience, and they're so powerful, and they're so full of knowing and experience and love and joy, that we say metaphorically, 'I'll do anything to do that. Show me, show me, show me what I'll do.'"  <br>And I relate to that. Like, I remember feeling like, "Whatever it takes, I want to go through that." Of course, now that we're here in the muck, you know, down in the contrast, it's hard, you know? And that was actually something that he communicated to me.  <br>At first, he kind of, you know, because there the communication is very honest, and there's not like social pretense. There's no politeness, you know? You don't have to play. So this message at first was like kind of brushing me off, like, "That's what they all say. It's hard in a way you don't know." Like, communicating, "You don't know how hard this is."  <br>And at the time, I was like, "I'll do it. I don't care how hard it is. I'll do it, you know?" I was super excited. I'm here now. We're here now. This life can be hard. I know, very, very hard at times. But it is in that there's so much opportunity.  <br>So that was the first inspiration. I'm just trying to speak to your question. I shouldn't say the first, first. That was my first inspiration before my physical incarnations. I existed before that.  <br><br><br>Does it mean that like all the bad things that are happening to us are actually not so bad? They're all opportunities?<br>
You know, we're not... okay, so it's not the correct, it's not the right way for us to act in fear and hurt each other. That is not our calling. Our calling is to be loving beings, not fearful beings.  <br>I'm saying that first because we're not supposed to make the journey more difficult for each other. We're not supposed to hurt each other. But when challenge arises, it is an opportunity for growth. We can use the contrast when it comes.  <br>And you know what? And it's even okay if we can't. It's even okay if there's a challenge that's too big at the moment. Actually, there's nothing too big for you. That's at the base level. Nothing is too big. But if it feels too big, if it seems too big, if it seems too hard, that's okay. Have mercy on yourself. Be gentle with yourself.  <br>This is not an easy journey, walking the physical.<br>
Is it necessary for you, let's say, to go through many years of some dark experiences in order to... or maybe it's possible to reduce? I mean, is it important to have much of that?<br>
I will never say that it is important that we go get suffering or that we go suffer. Suffering is going to happen because we have yet to evolve. That's going to happen already because suffering is what happens when fear happens, and fear happens when we have not yet evolved enough to meet this context with love.  <br>Loving beings, evolved beings, can meet a given context and not have fear. That's possible. But for those of us who have fear and the pain of it, it is an opportunity when the contrast arises.  <br>So I'm being careful how I say that because I don't want to communicate that suffering is good.<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.<br>
That's not the case because it's not necessary. It's actually not even necessary, but when it arises, why? What is it teaching? What is the fear that is allowing you to suffer? Or if it's a pain, what is your relationship with that present moment when the pain is there, like if it's a physical pain?  <br>Like a couple years ago, I had a very painful physical condition. My gallbladder was failing. It was ridiculously painful for about six weeks, and I was in tears throughout the day every day. And, you know, it's not my first very painful experience.  <br>But I tried to, when the pain was at its worst, look at it in a way that is not labeling, not interpreting it. It's just a sensation, a very strong sensation, but it's just a sensation that I put the meaning on. I get to assign what is this, what does this mean, and what am I feeling.  <br>And it's okay if it feels really strong. It's okay if it's hard. Be gentle with yourself. This is like seriously deep stuff we're doing here on earth. This is not like kindergarten. This is for the very daring beings who are willing to go through this much rigor. That's us. That's you, whoever is listening. You're a brave being.  <br><br><br>Now that we're here, how do you meet that moment? That's all you have to do is meet the moment. You don't have to worry about the whole thing. Just meet your moment, right now. If and if there's some kind of suffering in it, what is your relationship to it?  <br>Can you see it without labeling it, without grabbing it? Can you just know it? Can you just let it be in you, of you? If you do that deeply enough, you will, you may, and may and will even find an underneath it all, who you really are, the one that's knowing it, is always of joy and bliss, always.  <br>Now, you may not tangibly find that. Of course, I have suffered much. But it is possible to find when you accept all of it. All of it is taking place within that which is good and that which is fundamentally of joy. Like, we are always beings of love and joy.  <br>You take the darkest person on the earth at their deepest root. They want love. They need love. They are searching for love. They love love because they are love. Like, at the deepest level, that unity, that connectedness, that acceptance is what we all are.  <br>We're just pretty unevolved compared to how we might be someday. And so we make a lot of fearful choices every day. And we hurt each other all over the place. We are like a bunch of children running around. You know, the human race is at a relatively young stage in its evolution.  <br>And we are currently hurting each other, hurting the planet, you know? We're just kind of focused on these very short-term ideas, consumerism and materialism, and buy the next thing, and try to take the next, drink the next caffeine, or take the next drug, you know, whatever. Just... we are not as a species fully there yet.  <br>But when those challenges arise, it is an opportunity.<br>
Beautiful.<br>
And what is earth for you? Because you said somewhere that the earth is so beautiful, but it just felt there was more to that. What's your perception of earth?<br>
Yeah, okay. So there are many, many opportunities we can engage, physical opportunities, even just in our universe. And there are many universes. Very, very many, very, very huge, huge multiverse.  <br>And earth is like a tiny little piece, but earth is very precious and unique because earth is one of the most... special. I don't know, the words are really poor. I have felt that the earth is very precious in the opportunity of what we're doing in this play.  <br>Like, the human race, especially where we are right now, is in a very interesting time and a very interesting... the simulation is very rich and good. And now we're trying some rather extreme things. We're trying to integrate some extreme vibrations. We're trying to grow up in big step ways in a short amount of time.  <br>And earth is the place to do that. So if you are given a chance to play a character on earth and be a human, it is like the most precious gift. It's like me like... wow, really? I get to play? Oh my Gosh!  <br>Even though, you think a lot of humans, there's billions of us. There's way more spirits than there are humans, than there are slots. And so having the chance to play this character, it's just so precious, and it's such an opportunity.  <br>And you know, we often don't think about that now that we're here, and many of us are just trying to get through our suffering. I know. But it really is a precious opportunity.<br>
For everyone?<br>
Everyone. Absolutely everyone. Even being an animal on earth is a huge, huge opportunity.<br>
Really?<br>
Yeah, to be able to be a dog in someone's family and love them, and you know... wow, like, that's huge. It's all very significant.  <br>Everybody who's listening today is significant. Like, you really are. I'm not just saying. You're very significant, wherever you are. You're very precious and important. And what you decide to do with your time here in the small ways is very important and powerful and precious.  <br>If you can choose love over fear, if you can be your creative, if you can be yourself, your real self, in some way, some small way... wow. That's using this opportunity for what it's meant to be.  <br>It's amazing. Like, the only failure that we really can have when this is over is wasted opportunity. Like, we can't actually fail what we're doing here. It's a big play. We have fear. It's okay. On the other side, it's known. We're really trying something difficult. Everything is understood.  <br>We can't truly fail, but we can waste the opportunity. That happens, and that is a source of sorrow, so to speak. Not really sorrow, but it's a source of disappointment on the other side, you know, if you waste your time here.  <br>Wow. It's just so much. Like, I'm taking that in. You know, some moments, you just want to have that stillness and just really take it in.<br>
I love the stillness. I'm happy to have no conversation. Just listeners can't hear much if there's no speaking. Maybe feel much.  <br>I so love your message about small moments and how... and even you were sharing a story like how... well, in English, I won't be able to say the story as beautiful as you did, but there was a story of someone who was reviewing their life, and then they remembered that it was... the whole life... the most beautiful, celebrated moment of their life was...  <br>Do you want to tell the story?<br>
Yeah, when they watered a tree.<br>
Yeah, I apologize that I don't remember whose NDE this was because I keep mentioning this. I should probably look it up and remember, but there was an NDE where a person had a life review, and they were aware of how important it was that they had this one moment when they were young when their family was on vacation or something, I think they said, and they stopped, and their parents asked them to go take a bucket of water down to a river or a stream and fetch water.  <br>And then when they were carrying the bucket of water back to the car, they noticed a dry tree out of their way, and they took the time to go out of their way and dump some of the water onto the tree before making their way back to the car.  <br>And they didn't think anything of it, but they did it selflessly, you see? It was just unconditional. It was just, "I'm just going to water this tree." That's love.  <br>It's beautiful. Like, you don't even need to be with other people to meet a moment with love. The universe can hear you. You know, consciousness can hear you. You're a part of it. You are it.  <br>So if you can even... you're in your bathroom brushing your teeth, and you have a thought arise. Can you be merciful in yourself and can you love the person for just a moment? Recognize how someone is criticizing you. Why are they, you know, feel, I don't know, whatever small way, even in your own heart and mind, that you can choose love is beautiful.  <br>Like, we think in big terms while we're human. We think we have to move around all these objects and make money and buy things and own things and write books and all these things. We don't need to do any of that. We just need to be. We just need to be loving.  <br>If we can be in love with reality for even some time, we will have fulfilled our purpose.<br>
Really?<br>
Yeah, even appreciating a sunset or something like that.<br>
If someone has many gifts and has come here with great potential, does it mean that they are there to share it all with the world? Or does it mean that this design has to be fulfilled? Do the gifts have to be used?  <br>Yes. We are responsible for who we are, put it that way.<br>
Wow! Wait, wait, wait. We are responsible for who we are.<br>
I love that.<br>
So if you have a gift, you're responsible for using it.<br>
Right.<br>
Really?<br>
Yeah, but it's okay. I mean, I'm saying that simply in the broad sense that everything that we are, we're responsible for.  <br>Okay, let's say you have a friend, and the friend tells you something personal about themselves, and now you have some power over them because they told you a secret. So now you have to decide how you're going to use that new knowledge. You can use it lovingly and support them and accept their vulnerability and honor it. Or maybe one day you're feeling a little egoic, and you gossip about your friend, and it ends up hurting them. You're responsible for that.  <br>Right.<br>
So the same thing is that... so that's just a piece of knowledge, but the same thing is basically true of even our abilities. Like, as we grow, we become more aware, more capable.  <br>I'm being careful not to categorically say, you know, if you're good at this thing, you better go use it. I'm not saying that. You have total free will. You have total choice how to use your life. I'm simply saying that we're responsible for who we are, so do your best in all ways that you can.  <br>We should utilize our context the best way we can even if we don't know why the context is what it is, because of course, we don't remember our pre-life planning most of the time. So people will say, "Well, I don't know what I signed up for. So what am I supposed to do?"  <br>Use your contexts. That's it. What I mean is, if you're like... whatever, if you have health issues, or if you're in a certain family, or if you're in a certain country, or if you have certain abilities or certain weaknesses, just do your best to use that context and be the real you in it, and try to choose love rather than fear in it.  <br>If you do that, you'll find your way to what you are trying to do because ultimately, all this is about love. Love means so many things, and it means the exploration of so many kinds of experience. So I'm not just categorically saying one kind of love. I mean all the things that love can mean. If you are genuine, it's the best word.  <br>If you can be genuine and authentic with how you meet your experience and you own your own crap in your context, then that should be... so that is very powerful. And if you have talents that you came in to use, then you will be aware of those talents. You will have recognized them probably, and if you feel called to use them, use them.  <br><br><br>Another question is about communication with your Higher Self, with your teachers, your guides, your... how do you call them? And what's your way to like to establish that communication so that it really happens?<br>
It does happen.<br>
All the time?<br>
It happens all the time, whether we're aware of it or not is another story. I only rarely have those kinds of exchanges. I do have those kinds of exchanges occasionally, but they are very real.  <br>I'll just say two things for how we can encourage that exchange. Okay, first of all, you kind of lumped the Higher Self and spirit in general in one bucket. I'm just speaking in general to interacting with spirit, so other beings or guidance from the spirit or guides who are trying to help us, trying to perceive that.  <br>So two thoughts. One, I will re-mention meditation because if we're like totally listening to our thoughts all day, we're lost in the dreams of thinking. We're not going to get anything because we're too busy associating with the next thing all day long. We're caught up in a thought.  <br>So if we can spend time letting go of all that, all the thoughts, all the need to listen to the story, don't, don't. Just give yourself a period of time – 5 minutes or 20 minutes or 40 minutes or an hour – just block off time and just be with your awareness and give yourself permission to let go of the entirety of the story.  <br>So as you do that, there's this spaciousness that grows that you are, that you can feel. And in that spaciousness is a space for that communication to happen much more easily because you're not stuck, lost in the thinking.  <br>That's the first thing. The second thing I would say is... okay, vibrationally, we're like super low while we're on earth in general, but our vibration changes depending on what perspective we are entertaining.  <br>So if we're thinking, "I'm worthless, I'm powerless, I'm ugly," whatever, then that's a low vibration, and that makes the distance... okay, let's go this way. If source is here, and they're in the realms of... this is just not really how it is, but source is here, and the realms of spirit are, you know, maybe here, and we're all the way out here.  <br>So I'll move over a little bit. So if we are entertaining a low vibration perception, we are inadvertently increasing the distance vibrationally. Like, when you feel low, and you feel pain, when you feel fear, that is because you are vibrationally distant.  <br>The neurochemistry will immediately reflect it. I mean, it's in your brain too, of course, because you're physical. But I'm saying if you think, "I'm powerless," distance increases. But on the other hand, if you really feel grateful, or you recognize the love in the world, the love in yourself, or you appreciate beauty, you are naturally, automatically increasing your vibration back up.  <br>And I'm mentioning that in the context of this question because they are so high vibration. They have to like kind of come down. So if we can go up, and they can come down, there's a place to meet vibrationally in the middle.  <br>And so that is one reason that I feel that... I feel that mediums who are real and genuine are usually people who are very evolved. They've met a lot of fear, and they generally are very loving and real, you know? They don't do it as just like an activity or skill because usually if that's it's just like an exercise, that's usually a lower... you know, usually there's some ego service going on there, and that's not very high vibration.  <br>But if the desire to serve and connect is genuine, then the vibration is higher. So that's a place meeting, place for it.  <br><br><br>Oh, and one other thing, when your guard is down. That's kind of an example of the first one where you're not lost in thought. Like, a lot of people say like someone will pass, like a loved one will pass, and then two months later, they'll be in the shower or something, where they're just letting go, they're vulnerable, they're not thinking, they're just in the shower, and all of a sudden, they'll have like something like a message, or they'll feel their presence or something, you know?  <br>That's kind of common to hear that because their guard is down. They're not associated with the grief thoughts all... you know, this moment, they're just being, and there's a space.  <br>And by the way, while I mention that, this isn't your question, but I'll just mention this. The love that we have for each other is a very powerful bridge, very powerful connection. So when someone dies, not really a big deal in consciousness space. In the physical, of course, it's a terrible loss.  <br>But in the field of awareness itself and consciousness, we are very much connected to those that we love and those who love us. And even one loving thought, just one thought, is enough that they can kind of like follow back and come with us and be with us and maybe even try to communicate with us.  <br>Whether we perceive it or not is another story. We're in a super low vibration place, so we often miss it. We're too dense, so dense, but loving thoughts are like... I heard there's one channeled source I really love named Silver Birch. I love Silver Birch, and he said something like, "We perceive your loving thoughts like sound on the wind, that we can follow to you."  <br>Oh, I love that.<br>
And that is something I resonate with. That loving connection is a powerful bridge. So I'm just mentioning that for anybody who may be in grief right now, that you haven't lost those. We can't lose those we love. It's not possible.  <br>No.<br>
We can't lose them. We will grieve in the physical because we may not see them physically again for a lifetime, of course. But that's just a temporary play. This is like a dream. It's going to end. And when it's over, those relationships are still there. They're still real. We can still further them later. We still go do things together. In fact, the thing is, love is what we are.  <br>So and love is in relationship. So it's precious when we have loving relationships. Like, even a small amount of love on earth that binds two people together can feel very potent and strong in the non-physical.  <br>And so big relationships, deep relationships between spouses, or family members, or close friends, those are some powerful bonds. So it doesn't mean that everyone who we love... I mean, our relatives, I mean, people who have passed... so everyone who is no longer with us.  <br>So do we just send loving thoughts all the time? Do we send loving thoughts all the time?<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you can if you want. You don't have to because your true nature is known and seen. So they already know. If they want to come spend their time in that way... I mean, I'm putting it in a human way now because it's all... there's no linear time on that side. It's connected.  <br>But if they want to do that, then yes, they can see and sense and feel exactly like... in spirit, there are no secrets. There's everything is seen. Everything's known. Everything's open. You can't hide who you are, you know? And you can't hide how you really feel about people and how they feel about you. And if there's real love, it's real.  <br>Right.<br>
It's like... I just feel that we are trying to put like really big things, and I know, I know I hate trying to do it because trying to take words and like I shove these things into words, it doesn't work. But still, if someone who's listening can feel maybe what we're talking about, then that's awesome.  <br>But that raises the vibration like I was saying, you know? Just even you and I having this conversation, other people listening, it's like an energetic opportunity. You know, people's vibration gets raised, and then the non-physical friends, our guides, they can even use that. They can be like, "Oh, look, see, that's available now. That's good. That's great. Let's do that. Let's use that. Let's help nudge these people in the right direction and encourage them."  <br>So much encouragement is actually coming our way, if you can feel it or not.  <br><br><br>And if I ask you, what is the soul?<br>
Thus, so on earth, we like to think of reality like things, you know? Like, there's trees, and there's rocks, and there's tables, and there's houses, and cars, and bodies, and... so if you want to know what one thing, and then there's ideas too. So then we want to know if... what if there's this thing and there's this, what thing is this thing like? Because if I can correlate them, now I know. Is it like this or is it like that?  <br>Well, the problem is... well, not the problem, the situation is that consciousness itself, spirit itself transcends all of the form. It's bigger than all of the form, so there isn't really any form we can use to identify it.  <br>Okay, so but that being said, we'll at least try to use a parable or another metaphor because metaphors are the best way we can try to talk about these things sometimes.  <br>I like the metaphor of the ocean and the drop of water in the ocean. I write about this in my book. If the ocean is all that is, and that source, and we are, and then we are a drop in the ocean, so we are a part of it. Is there really a separation between the drop and the ocean? No, it's a part of the ocean. It can't really be separate.  <br>But in the ocean occur all sorts of things. Like, if you picture a physical ocean, you have currents, and you have changes in salinity and temperature, and there's lots of things happening in the water, but it's all water. And that is like how our reality is. It's all water. It's all consciousness. It's all being experienced by consciousness within consciousness.  <br>So what is the soul? The soul is the consciousness. It's the "I" that is knowing the form. It is the drop in the ocean.  <br>I love the Rumi quote: "You are not just a drop in the ocean. You are the mighty ocean in the drop."<br>
I love that so much. I love it because, you know, we think, "Well, I'm just a small little human who can't pay their bills, you know, whatever," or "I'm this person with illness. That's all I am." That's not all you are. You're just having the deep dream of being that for the purposes of love, joy, and expansion of love and joy through evolution.  <br>What you really are is one with the whole. We're all one. We're all connected to each other. We are both individuated – that means unique – and the whole. And so we just call the individuation a soul.  <br>So you, the you that feels like you to you, is your soul. You are the you that feels like you to you, not the human identity, not the human character, not the name, the forms, the feelings, the sense data. You're not... you're just experiencing and using those things.  <br><br><br>And is this something that I'm going to be with always? I mean, not the form of it, but like the essence? It's like always, always?<br>
Okay, so when you ask yourself that question, what answer feels good?<br>
Yeah.<br>
Yes, always.<br>
Because that's the truth. If you consider these big spiritual ideas, if it doesn't feel comfortable, something's missing. We resonate with, we feel the best when we consider the most hopeful ideas because they are the truth. They are the root that we've come from.  <br>And so yes, that's not the only reason. I'm just saying that's just a gauge. But the truth feels good, right? I'm just saying that the truth feels good. The truth always feels good, the ultimate truth. It feels good in a way that's not just ego story.  <br>Ego stories can feel a little bit good, and they can be tricky. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about deep being level, that feeling right. So I'll just say the soul is that individuation. The uniqueness of you is precious. It's precious to the whole, very precious. In fact, you are deeply, deeply, deeply loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, not just as a generic thing, but because you're you. You're loved. You're just so loved.  <br>So that, of course, that's going to be upheld. Of course, that individuation is precious, and yes, you'll go on. And when you are past the human experience, then you just are in a much, much, much less constraining environment. You're much more yourself. Like, this state of being human is the less you state, you know?  <br>We are bound by the chemistry of the brain and all the limitations and the pains, and that's the weird... that's when you don't feel as much like yourself, but you're still you. I mean, you're you right now, and you'll be even more you when the limitations are let go, when you take off the heavy spacesuit and step out. You're still you. You're just not in a suit anymore.  <br>So freeing. It's wonderful.  <br><br><br>How do you remember that you are loved? How do I remember or how do we remember? How do we... because you say this so beautifully. I mean, I know that just one thing to remember is to listen to you talking about that. It just immediately brings me back into this remembering.  <br>Beautiful.<br>
But how else do we remember that while we're living our lives, that we are so deeply loved? How do we know that?<br>
Oh man, that is a very difficult question simply because the veil is organic. The veil means the forgetting of the fact we've agreed to forget what we are while we're here.  <br>The veil is very effective. Of course, it's ridiculously effective, but it's also organic, and it's not a hard rule. And so first, I'm just saying in the context of the question, be reminded that you are already on the other side too. You're already there. Your fullness of who you are is already what you are.  <br>It's just we get wrapped into these stories of our lives. We believe so deeply in... especially the pain stories, that we don't feel that love actively on the human level anymore. So how can we feel it? That's a very personal question.  <br>Just like I was saying, the soul is so unique, that the path of any individual soul back to know who they truly are, it's a very personal, individualized path. But in general, I think some of the other things we've already talked about can be helpful. Meditation can be helpful. Practicing, examining your intention to see where you're building love rather than fear can be really helpful because if you're loving the person next to you, you will feel love. I mean, right, that's actually true.  <br>Or whereas, if you're being selfish and you're like trying to protect yourself, that hurts, and thinking itself actually hurts. Thinking all day long – think, think, think – that hurts. So that can be helpful too.  <br>Meditation is one. Choosing love over fear is another. And then, I'd say also, okay, the physical is like a big mirror that reflects back to us what we believe about it, okay? So but it's also a really cool toy. The whole physical world is like a big toy.  <br>So you can use the toy, and what I mean is, go play, have fun. Or you see something beautiful, go admire it. Wow, that's beautiful. Go look at that. Go spend time with it. Or I don't know, whatever experience you feel like you will most resonate with and brings you excitement, go do that, you know? Because that's okay. That's great. That helps us remember because when we are acting in love and in freedom, then we remember our love.  <br>Before this body, right? On the level of the soul, when I look at this life, when I plan, when I do, when I kind of design life, right? Do I do the details? How detailed do I do all of that? And then the question is, what if it's just out of my plan?  <br>So in my pre-birth experience, I had an intention first. The intention was to meet this fear and integrate this low vibration and to really grow in that way. So then they brought me a life that was appropriate, like it would work.  <br>It would be like they review... imagine like a database or something. They review it all, and they are skilled at, you know, taking like a package, like a life context, and being like, "Will that work for this for this being? Yeah. Is it hard? Yeah. Is it hard? Is it too hard, you know?" And they review all of it, but it's all tons of information is reviewed all at once, and then they bring it to you.  <br>And then I reviewed it, and as I reviewed it, I could see. I could simultaneously review what would all the millions of possibilities of what might happen, and what was very likely or less likely to happen, but I also was able to make requests. So they were able to tweak it, you know, tweak the package.  <br>And who are they?<br>
The guides. I don't know. I worked with a guide who is a very loving and wise being who knows me and knows... it's very wise. Wise is the best word. And so I worked with them. This one guide in particular, but them, a group of them. I asked for things, and I kind of... I made certain statements that I was just certain about, like, "I really want to be intelligent in this life because I really have appreciated being intelligent. I enjoy that quality. I don't really want to not be intelligent, you know?"  <br>That was one thing I mentioned, and they said, "You can do that. That's okay." And then I said like, "I want to not forget everything this time. I want to have a tiny, tiny, smallest sliver of memory. Can I do that?" And they said, "Yes, that will make the life more painful, more difficult," because I knew that the contrast would be even greater. I'd have to dive even deeper, and I'd have to be even more sensitive is the right word. I'd have to be very sensitive.  <br>So but I knew that even that contrast was an opportunity for growth, so I accepted that. I said, "That's okay. I'll do that." And I knew that this body had a limitation that other bodies don't have, a biological limitation, a genetic limitation that would make my day-to-day experience difficult in a way that it's not for other people, but I knew that would actually be very useful for me because I knew that it would kind of pressure my ego or something. It would make sure that I didn't go too far on an ego path because the day-to-day limitation would humble me, which would be helpful so that I didn't turn into a monster, you know, that kind of thing.  <br>I mean, I'm speaking generally. It's not... it's hard to put a lid on these things.<br>
I get it completely somehow.<br>
Yeah, okay, good. That's very, very complex.  <br>So it was like a tree being laid on its side with millions of possibilities, and I knew that it was very likely that I would be crushed in my 20s by a trauma, and that happened as I mentioned. And I also knew that this lifetime I would be going much further out in a certain experiential direction than I had ever gone.  <br>Like, this is a poor metaphor, but if you imagine like... imagine a home base in the middle, and then you go out into the wilderness like in different directions from the home base, and then you have little states like how far you made it out in all these different directions, something like that. Like, you went that way for two miles, and you went that way for five miles, and you went that way for six miles.  <br>It's not exactly like this. I'm just using a metaphor. It was like there was one direction I was going to go that was way past the state that I already had, and I'm there now. Like, I'm at a place now that is very, very much further than what I could previously had. I have tolerated, but I've learned to do it. I'm trying to.  <br>So I reviewed all that context, so I had some input, but it was like the context existed. The body, the parents, I mean, the life was going to happen, and it didn't have to be me playing this character, but I was a good fit.  <br>And actually, this life was not as good of a fit as the previous one that I attempted to use. I mentioned in my other talk that I inadvertently had ended prematurely because I responded in fear. So this life wasn't as good, but it was... it was still, it was good enough, you know? It was good. It was appropriate. It was like... I'm just throwing numbers out there, but if the first one was 99% appropriate, this one's like 86% or 87%, you know, whatever. Not perfect, but it's good.  <br><br><br>But do you just live this life as it is, or you create things that maybe were not planned?<br>
Yes, you do create things that were not. So all what you're signing up for is a context, and then once you're in the context, you have free will. And that is what makes the physical experience so valuable, actually.  <br>Is one of the things... there's a lot of things that make it very valuable, but one of the things that makes it so valuable is it provides novelty. What I mean is, unanticipated things happen because we're all making choices, and so the system is really good at predicting what's going to happen ahead of time. It's really good. It knows us really well. It knows you really well. It knows me really well. It knows all the information in the whole universe really, what he knows.  <br>But the choices are free will, so things can happen that didn't maybe anticipate originally, and then you got to deal with that, and wow, that's exciting, you know what I mean? Because now you got to deal with like something, and you might make different choices once you're here, of course.  <br>You know, the soul plan has made it higher at the soul level, but you as an individual, you are still your soul playing human character. So if you do it in a deep enough way... yeah, I mean, yeah, we do alter. We do make changes. So yes, we have freedom once we're here.  <br>And so it's possible to create so many great things that at the end, you're just like, "Wow, so my lifetime is even better than my soul has planned."<br>
Yes.<br>
Yes, yes, exactly.<br>
Yeah, absolutely.<br>
I would love that.<br>
I would love that too. I really would love that.<br>
That's awesome. Maybe we're doing it right now together while we're having this conversation. Maybe it will right now. Maybe it will help nudge somebody.<br>
Wow, to have that freedom.  <br>And, you know, also this moment when your life has stopped unexpectedly, right? When you stopped your life in a previous lifetime, it's an important question. I was thinking about that like because many people leave before maybe they are meant to, and so does it mean that... it's like, let's say they're depressed, or it's like temporary experiences are so overwhelming that they choose to go, but actually, there is so much beauty waiting for them just around the corner, for example, right? And meeting people, meeting all the opportunities, having so many contracts. Tell me about that.  <br>Like I said, novelty is valuable. It is possible that plans are made, and they just don't come to fruition, and that's okay. If that happens, well, maybe we'll try again later. That's all right. We can do that. But meanwhile, the experience that remains is also valuable in a different way that may have been unanticipated.  <br>Right.<br>
But also, I kind of want to say to the people who feel low or thinking of those kinds of thoughts, I just want to tell them that around the corner, there might be a completely different story.<br>
Yeah, absolutely.  <br>What happens is, the more we're in fear, the smaller and smaller our... this is a term from Tom Campbell, the consciousness explorer... our decision space gets. In other words, the more that we focus on fear and pain, we tend to get to have less and less and less choices that we see. They're there. There are many choices there. And conversely, when we act in love and in vulnerability and in fearlessness, more and more choices become available.  <br>So they may not see what's around the corner. I will also say this is very important for anyone who's suffering with deep, deep depression or feels suicidal. I have experienced incredible biochemical lows myself. They can be unbelievably painful, and when you're in the middle of them, it feels like it will never end, but that is a lie. The feeling that it will never end is a lie. It's the story of the fear and the story of the pain and the biochemistry.  <br>Here's the thing – having a brain and a body is very persistent and limiting. If the brain has a certain biochemistry going on, it will affect, of course, very much what you experience. Like, if I take almost any medicine, any drugs, I cannot tolerate it. I will feel like I'm losing my mind, and I will be in a lot of pain, neurochemical pain, for a long time.  <br>But that's because my brain is in that's... the energy state and the biochemical state of the brain. But I want to communicate to anyone who's in that deep, deep pain – it is not who you are. The pain is an experience you are having. There's a big difference there, and the you that is experiencing the pain can and will experience other much more wonderful things past the pain.  <br>And it takes... I'm not making light of it. I'm really... I know how deep, deeply painful it can be, and I even understand. I do not condone suicide. Suicide is not the way out. It's not. But I understand how people would reach that point when the pain seems like there's no escape.  <br>But as you pointed out, there is always beautiful opportunity there waiting for us at every moment. And so we need to have an incredible amount of bravery to pick ourselves up off the ground and be like, "You know what? I hurt, but I'm gonna go live some life right now in whatever form that means." Maybe the only thing you have the strength to do is watch a TV show. That's okay.  <br>You know, like, spirit knows you are. It's okay if your context is very limiting. That's totally okay. You get to choose how you meet that context. That's the key. The power of your intent, your choice, for this small, small moment, are you going to choose love or fear? Even self-love. Are you going to choose self-love or fear in this moment?  <br>And if we can do that, what happens is we begin to change the momentum back towards the freedom and love, one bit at a time. Like, another thing is our one last comment about that. Our mind is very powerful because we're framing the entire experience. So if you decide, just decide, put your foot down. "I am going to reframe this experience right now." Decide. The pain is yelling at you: "You're terrible, you know, you the world is bad, you're stuck, you're worthless."  <br>NO. Use your intent. Use your will. You are the master. You're the captain of the ship. Your ship may be falling apart. You're the captain of the ship! Stand up! Claim your power. Reinterpret your experience.  <br>There's so much power in that. There's so much power in that. Our whole world is our interpretation of it, and we can change the momentum. I know we build up momentum of interpretation. If we look at the world in a certain way for a whole lifetime, our interpretation gets super deep.  <br>But now is the moment of power. Now is the time you can change that interpretation and start a new momentum towards whatever new person is around the corner or whatever new joy is there waiting for you.  <br><br><br>If we talk about communication with our guides on our higher powers, right? So it's like if you are really low, we can't meet right, and it just feels like if you are really in the wrong place, then and it feels like you don't have the power to even say that's my intention.  <br>I know, I know, but it may feel like that, but that is... that's after thousands of light of deepenings of that type of perspective, whether someone else put it upon you or whether you put it upon yourself. You always have that point of power to choose something more free and exciting or fun or relaxed or not judgmental or loving or whatever the pause, you know?  <br>You get to choose how you meet and how you frame any choice, no matter what it is.<br>
Right, that's the rule. That's it.<br>
That's it. You get to choose like do you choose love or fear in any... when I say the word intent, I don't just mean a goal of action. I'm talking about the move. I'm talking about the movement of consciousness itself when you... how do you meet your moment? That's what I'm talking about at the deepest, deepest level. How are you meeting your moment? The choices, then, are decisions we make within the context. That's kind of subsequent. What's first is we intend, and then through our intention, we pick choices. We make choices, but the intention is first, deep intention.  <br>Beautiful.<br>
Beautiful, Christian.<br>
It is beautiful. I'm really enjoying our conversation. I really appreciate it. You shine brightly. I hope you can affect many people in a positive way.  <br>Thank you. It's just so inspiring for me to speak with you because of everything you are and what you share and your message. And you know, I opened your book, and I'm like, "Gosh, there is so much, you know?" It just felt like electricity, and that's something I'm looking forward to read.  <br>It's awesome.<br>
Thank you. I feel that every one of us here is a deeply brave, wonderful being. We're all brothers and sisters, every one of us. We just are. Like, every person on the street, every person we meet is powerful and good and loving. If we can remind a few people that, that's powerful stuff.  <br>My last question, if there was such a thing as the soul's code... what do you think it could be?<br>
The soul's code is love. It's freedom, joy, creativity, and love. Love is the... endless love, boundless freedom, pure joy. That's the code of the soul. That's what we are.  <br>So can we do that here?<br>
That's the question.<br>
Thank you.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2022/a-gift-of-being-human-–-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2022/A Gift of Being Human – Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:03:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Angela Tomlinson Interview with Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>5 APR 2022<br>YouTube.com/watch?v=3Kwzw4JHtBU<br><br><br>Well, good morning, Christian. It's really nice of you to take some time out to have a chat with me this morning for me and this evening for you.<br>Yes, hello. My test, my mic. Is this better mic than the first one?<br>I didn't actually hear the first one. That's a very good mic, and I'm having mic envy.<br>Okay, how about this microphone?<br>They're both fine. Everything's okay because this one is the better one.<br>Okay, all right. Sorry, just kidding.<br>Yeah.<br>So, thank you for taking the time. TED Talk sounds very interesting.<br>Yeah, it is an interesting thing for me to do because I don't speak openly about this kind of area of my belief system. I am going to be speaking to an audience on this. My alarm to wake up. I'm going to be speaking to an audience who are perhaps new to this kind of thing and opening their mind to the possibility that we are making choices well before we're born. So, hopefully, I actually feel inspired to share that because of some reading that I've done and exploration in that realm. I really think that it can make a difference to people's existence on this mortal plane if we approach life as if everything's been our own choice. That's really what I wanted to talk to you today about.<br><br><br>Yeah, I'm very passionate about this topic.<br>Yeah, it is true. It is true that we choose it.<br>So, can we just go back to the beginning for the purposes of maybe orienting people who might listen to this? Would you be able to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your background?<br>Yeah, sure. So, my name is Christian, and my body is currently 42 years old in Erie, Pennsylvania, United States. So, a few years ago, I began to share about what's called pre-birth memory. That is, I have awareness of time that I existed before I incarnated into this life as Christian. That memory returned to me spontaneously 12 years ago when I took up a long-term meditation practice. It was not expected. It was just very normal when it arrived. When it came back to me, it was the most normal thing in the world. It was just like leaves had been blown off of the ground, and there it is. It's like, "Oh, yes, of course, I remember." <br>So, not strange to me at all now, but up until the age of 30, I had no memory of it at all. Well, I should say that as a small child, I had some memory of existing before I was born up until maybe the age of five or six, and I assumed that everybody had that memory, but nobody else talked about it, so I didn't either. But then that memory left me completely. You know, as we become deeply associated with the forms of the physical and with our stories, it's quite natural for us to be veiled from that memory. That's the name of the game here. <br>So, I had no awareness of that at all until about 12 years ago, and then I didn't share it for maybe about eight years or so because, you know, I'm a working professional, and it's the kind of thing you don't really talk about if you want to be taken seriously. But I felt intuitively nudged that I really should share this, that the ground was fertile. This is about maybe four years ago now that I shared it, and I just felt like the ground was fertile, and it was time for me to share. <br>So, I did. When I first shared, I thought maybe five people will hear this or something, but no, it's become, it's taken on a life of its own, and I've been able to meet an incredible number of people from around the world who have similar experiences or some personal experiences they're trying to understand, and this has helped. In the process of that, I also wrote a book. I spent about six years or so slowly feeling. <br>So, this book that I wrote is not one I ever sat down and just wrote. I felt that I was intuitively guided piece by piece to create this book called "A Walk in the Physical." My intention is to try to share what the human experience is within the larger context because there is a much bigger, very real spiritual context. We use the word "spiritual," but it's just the higher context that we exist within. I have felt called to share that in a way that is digestible, not in a way so much that is stimulating for the ego because, you know, we like lots of stories. I do share some stories, but I think it's more important to help remind each other what we really already know deep down, you know, underneath the stories of the human life, that which the deeper part of us already knows. <br>So, that's kind of my passion, sharing that message. Like I said, it's been met very well. I cannot believe the amount of people out there who resonate with the message and have similar pre-birth memories. I've probably met 30 or 40 other pre-birth experiencers now, and it's just awesome because here in this place, we're in such a unique vibrational place during the human experience. So, when we can meet here in this place and connect in this way, it's really awesome. It's a very powerful opportunity.<br>It is interesting that in this sort of globally connected time, and probably more so because of the dreaded COVID, that people are having the opportunity to connect and find each other in ways that may never have happened in the past. So, I wonder if people with your knowledge have always walked with us on the earth or whether this is a relatively new thing because of the changes afoot that people are having these memories. What are your thoughts?<br>Oh, I think no, I think it's there's always been people who have awareness of who we really are. I'm not special in any way. It's just that we come from a higher context, and we all know deep down about that context. It's just that we are in a, it's like Earth is like a simulation or a virtual reality, you could say, and it's just the nature of this virtual reality that we don't typically remember the larger portion of ourselves. That's just normal. But because our true nature is what it is, there's always people on Earth who are aware and who have shared that message. Right now, humanity is going through a process that is often called the awakening. It just means that there is a shift in consciousness occurring, and so it is becoming increasingly common for us to have awareness in this way and to share with each other. That's awesome. It allows us to change the world for the better.<br><br><br>It's good. I am curious about following that line, but I do have some questions that I need to ask. Of course, if we have time at the end, maybe we can come back to that. So, Christian, talk to us about your extremely difficult life experience that you've had.<br>Yeah, so I won't recount my whole story for the sake of time, but I'll just say that I was aware in my pre-birth planning that I would very likely be completely crushed and traumatized in my 20s by a very difficult experience that would allow me to have the opportunity to re-engage a fear that had bested me in a previous experience. That is a fear that had overcome me, that I couldn't process, I couldn't talk, I couldn't integrate in the previous experience. <br>So, I knew that it would be very powerful if I could do that in this experience, if I could meet this fear and really process it, heal it, integrate it, and grow from it and not be overcome all the way. So, when I was 22, I had an experience that was very traumatizing for me. It was a medical event. On the surface, what happened on Earth was that I had a heat stroke in China. I was in a Chinese hospital for four days. I had bag after bag of potassium for four days. I was also weakened due to celiac disease. <br>So, somehow, the collection of these circumstances was such that after this experience, during and after this experience, I was in incredible physical pain, neurological pain. I don't know how to describe it other than just saying it was an agony that just would not abate. It was just impossible to escape this pain. It was terrible. It was a hellish experience. I experienced trauma from it. I had post-traumatic stress for about six or seven years. In fact, during that period, I could barely even remember my lifetime up until that event. <br>During that event, my mind blocked it off so completely that I could barely even remember my previous life before the age of 22 because this experience was so difficult for me. It wasn't just the pain. There was also a lot going on in my life at the time. Big life changes that I couldn't handle, familial life changes, graduating from college, financial things, everything all at the same time. <br>So, then I went through EMDR therapy for a number of years to face and process and integrate this, to heal this trauma, this damage. It was only after that that I was able to then have this spiritual awakening journey that, like I said, began at the age of around 30. I took up a meditation practice. At first, I just continued meditating because I felt relief from the constant bombardment of thinking and associating with thought. <br>But then, after a few months of that, I began to have non-physical experiences, short at first but very eye-opening, that kind of kept me going down that path because I realized, wow, there really is a lot more going on. But I don't think that could have happened until I had really met and deeply processed this trauma. I no longer feel that I, I mean, I still have fear, of course, but I have done so much personal work to fully come to terms with and integrate this fear and this traumatic experience that arose from and through fear. Does that answer your question?<br>Yeah, can you tell me what you mean by integrate? How does one integrate fear, and what's the purpose of doing that in our lives?<br><br><br>Well, that's a big question because what we are is experienced integrators. We are consciousness that engages context, and we become something. From the perspective of this limited person with a very rich, detailed context, we make choices, and then results happen because of our choice-making. <br>So, to put it at a more fundamental level, we wield intent. Intention is the primary action. It's not choice-making happens within a context, but the intent to choose something is that movement of consciousness to intend, which is our fundamental power. Being able to wield an intention that is more in alignment with love, which is reflective of our true nature, rather than fear, is the name of the game. <br>So, really, what we're doing here is striving to actualize love, to meet our experience with love, and all the things love can mean. Love is not just one emotion or something. It's reflective of the unity of our being. You know, because at our base level, we are individuated, but we are also one. We're one with each other. So, love is reflective of the celebration of and support of all the things that it means to be one, to be unified, and how we interact with each other in that state. Here on Earth is where we experience the illusion of separation very deeply. We feel so separate, and when that happens, fear arises, and then we have to deal with that. <br>So, love and fear are really the two. That's why so much spirituality is in discussion about these two ideas because really, it's what intention are we bringing to bear? An intention that is in alignment with love, or are we aligning ourselves with fear? That is the portion of us that is protesting and rising up against the limitations and the perceptions we've bought into about the limitations. You know, when we buy into a perception that is not in alignment with the truth, we suffer. <br>So, for instance, if we believe this all relates to your original question, so I'll get back to it, but if we buy into the idea that I am unworthy of love, that's a big one on Earth, or if we buy into the idea that I have no power, I'm powerless, or I'm shameful, or I'm not free, you know, these are some of the key perceptions we buy into on Earth that are not in alignment with the actual truth of who we are. Who we truly are is totally free, totally loving, loved and loving, totally creative and powerful. That's what we are. <br>So, when we bind a perception that is not that, that prompts us to experience fear, which means a rejection of and no way, I'm not okay with this response. So, what does integration have to do with all this? Okay, so integration is just the best word that I can think of, but the idea is that as we engage experience and truly grow towards love, past fear and towards love, we expand. That is, we grow in what we really are because consciousness is what we really are, and consciousness lasts. It lasts beyond any given context, including this context. <br>So, when it can meet a certain context and be put under some constraints and then work out that context, and that means really assimilated, you know, really like what is it like to be you, like exactly you, in this place with this body, with these health challenges, with this circumstance set, with your family and your background and your history and the demands of your body and their finances and all the things. What do you do with that? You know, that ability of consciousness to meet that context and then operate through it, shine through it, make choices through it, it is so powerful because it allows a growth or a refinement or an evolution of beingness. This is really hard to talk about, but it's kind of like the main point for what we're doing on Earth. <br>So, I'll just bring up a metaphor because I think it can help. Okay, so if you're sitting on your couch watching television and you're super comfortable and you've got access to food and everything's comfortable and nice, why would you ever voluntarily get up off the couch and go for a run outside? Like, why would you put yourself through that stress? <br>Well, because when you do that, the stress of the run allows a growth in the strength of your body, and in such a way that when you get back to the couch, you're stronger, and not only that, you can even appreciate the couch in a new way. You know, because now you can relax and wow, this couch is nice and comfortable. The food even tastes better. You know, that kind of thing. It's just a metaphor, but what I mean is when we can subject ourselves to incredible limitation and then if we can choose love through that limitation and come to terms with our fear and overcome it, and overcoming fear is synonymous with the growth of love because fear is the real limiter, if we can do that, then we grow, and we help. Not only do we grow individually, but the collective grows. All in fact, all that is expands. <br>So, in that way, being human is like fulfilling a, I don't know, the words are so limiting. That's one thing I just have to say every time I try to talk about this is that there is no language at all to discuss any of this. But we could say that it is a service to be human because we are helping to, hands-on, get down in the weeds in an extremely low vibration state of being by comparison and work through it. Working through it may be another way to say integrate. <br>Working through it so that our true nature of love can shine into it. And wherever we have fear is a sign that we have not yet fully integrated the experience, and that's okay because we are in a heck of a limiting experience right now. This is like a master-level class or something or climbing Mount Everest. You know, it's cold on Mount Everest. It's okay. There's not very much oxygen. Exactly. It's okay to acknowledge I can't breathe. I feel cold. Yes, that's the nature of being this limited. What do you do now? That's the key. It's not about being called unlimited fundamentally and in the end. It's about what you do, what you choose while you're in it.<br>Yeah, very good. That answers my next question though, the idea of what's the purpose of this sort of experience, the hard experiences. But you would come across people, I imagine, who have had some pretty traumatic experiences, and what do you say to people who are more resistant to what it is that you're saying? You know, people who would say, "I wouldn't choose to be raped or to have my child murdered," or those kinds of things. What would you say to them?<br>Oh, my. I totally would. I totally respect and honor that. First of all, I am not making light of the horrors of the world. I mean, I have personally experienced incredible pain. I certainly haven't even touched the iceberg of some of the potential horrors that can occur on Earth. However, it is the ego that rejects. The ego, which arises from fear, that is the case even if a great horror has arisen, and we reject it. And I reject things too still, of course. I'm still learning and growing like we all are, of course. <br>But there's always fear at the root if there is a rejection. If there is a judgment and saying, "No effing way," you know, whatever the explanation, "No way," that rejection always arises from some deep down fear because ego has arisen to protect the individual from this state, this context, which seems untenable. It seems unacceptable, and you know, just no, this is not okay. The moment we say that, we are in a sense turning ourselves against what reality has actually or how it is actually arisen. And rejection is a way of it's like a closing of the door, not a full opening, whereas love is fully open. <br>So, I don't know how else to comment on that because it's certainly not, it's not, it's one can't speak to it. But I can say that the love of what we are and the joy of what we are is deeper. It is deeper than the deepest pain, the deepest trauma, the deepest horror that can arise on Earth. The truth of our being, the love and the creativity and the power and the joy of our being is deeper. It's just we can't see it when we're wrapped within the pain, when we're wrapped within the perception and the story that hurts so much that, like I said, that perception that is not in alignment with that truth is with that we lose ourselves in that perception, and then we hurt. <br>We think about it, and then the thoughts hurt, and that's then that's who we are for that moment. That's, I mean, it's okay even that we do that because that's the nature of the human experience is to dive so deeply into these roles that we actually have to make hard choices. You know, like being on Earth is no joke. I mean, this is a no joke simulation, you could say, that is so deep that here we can experience even what it's like to not have power or to be physically harmed or to suffer loss that seems to never go away for a lifetime. You know, that's just the, but see, that is not a negative. It's actually a neutral context. It's just that the physical world is a neutral context that is extremely limiting. It's an extremely limiting context.<br>It's like wearing a very, very heavy, like, I don't know, metal coat or something, and then seeing if you can get up and walk around, and then someone is really having a hard time with the coat, and they say, "What if they say the coat's heavy?" You have, "Yes, it's heavy." But you always have the power to choose what to do with it, like what meaning you put on it. You assign the meaning. Whoever you are listening, you have the power to assign the meaning to your circumstances. The circumstances are not intrinsically charged.<br><br><br>How would a person get from trapped in the fear and move towards the love? How do we make that transition?<br>So, that is an extremely personal question. Each person's because that is the person, that is the one of the main processes that we're here to do. And we are all very unique individuals. You know, as humans, we look kind of the same, but as spirits, we are incredibly unique beings. So, each being's walk will be unique. I'll at least always make a couple of comments. Okay, first of all, we need to be willing to feel. I was going to say accept because it's really about we need to be willing to accept and allow everything that is occurring. That doesn't mean that we don't intervene when necessary. <br>That's not at all what I'm talking about at this moment. I'm talking about the state of being in which we meet the context. If we can totally allow and accept and not resist and not fight, our own feelings will rise up immediately to like the ego's protests will come right up, "No, I'm not okay with that," because this, I feel this, whatever is down there underneath all the layers of ego and all the pains and all the stories is asking for you to feel it and fully know it, fully face it. You know, like, it's what I'm trying to say is it's like when I experienced trauma after China, and I had hundreds of layers of covering from the root fear, I would find layer underneath layer underneath the layer over years of counseling of pain and a new negative self-perception, a new negative self-perception surely. Well, this one's really painful. Wow, that's got to be the root. <br>No, I mean, it was like my ego had built 800 layers of story on top of this one primary horrible fear that I knew in the certain moment in this hospital in Chengdu, China, and I was so rejecting of that that I locked myself away in trauma. The way, in my own walk at least, I can only speak for myself, but in my own walk, the way to actually heal that was to go into it, not away, but to actually feel it when it arose, fully, fully, fully feel it and allow it. That allowing is like an opening of the door of what you are so that your being actually experiences it and lets it up and out and through. <br>And if you do that all the way, there is like it feels like it will destroy you maybe, but after the tornado picks you up and swings you around and smashes you against the ground a couple of times, it feels like you're going to die from feeling what's actually down there. You won't die. In fact, you're set free because the consciousness that you are is no longer tied within, bound within, locking something away in resistance. It's open. And when everything can flow, and that fear can be felt and processed, it becomes integrated. And as it becomes integrated, there is a natural expansion of the potentials of now what you can know and feel that you couldn't before. <br>So, you don't go face it because you're trying to get rid of it. Like, you don't go, "Okay, I'm gonna heal this. I'm gonna go look in this dirty closet." You know, you honor yourself enough to actually feel what you feel and actually own your own crap all the way. That's a quality of intention. That's why I go back to intent. It's about the intention that you bring into that fear. So, I think that's the most succinct way I could say is a) feel, and b) what quality of intention are you bringing into the fear? <br>Now, the ego will spin great long stories. It's hard to find our way out of. I'm not making light of that, but if you are actually willing to feel and to own your own crap and, like, I mean, take responsibility for your own imperfect motivations and your own limitations and your own role in your own pain, if you're really willing to own that, you will be given opportunities because the deeper parts of you are working with what seems like, you know, you seem like you're not your deep report. <br>You are your deeper self. It's one being, but to the human personality, it may seem like things just are lifted up to be processed almost like they come from an external place. You just process them as they rise. You allow yourself to be willing to do that because your growth is success is the success of the whole thing. Like, the whole, all of spirit benefits when you succeed and actually growing. So, if you're really willing, you will be given opportunities. It just means that you are going to need to be willing to feel and to own, to own your own crap.<br><br><br>Christian, can I just get a definition in your view of what ego is because it's laden with inference that's quite negative in our use of that term currently, but I think you might have used it interchangeably with the phrase human personality. Can you talk to that for a moment?<br>Oh, no, yes. I don't mean to say that the human personality is ego. Now, ego though, so how I define ego is the portion of the self that has arisen in order to deal with fear and is birthed by fear. So, it's just the portion of the self that does whatever it can to fix this new big problem. <br>So, now that we're separate, that's a big problem because now I don't have my power. I don't have the love. What's going on? I'm in a world of pain, and where I got to do these things to survive, and oh my gosh, the ego is the portion of the self that does it, grasps it, whatever it can to tell a story and to secure beliefs that will make the individual feel better. <br>So, it's just the portion that is creating a story through beliefs and through self-identifications to try to fix the problem, I guess that's the best way I can. Whereas the human personality, the ego is just a term. It just means there's a portion of us that is acting in fear. So, as a simple example, when somebody is like, let's say they belong to a religious group, and they believe that by associating with this religious group, they are better than other people. Well, that's a very simple ego trick. <br>Look, now that you're a part of this group, and all I have to do is believe that this gives me value. See, oh, now that I believe it, your problem is solved. It seems the problem is not actually solved. It's a trick. It's an illusion, but we do that with so many things. Look, you have value when you have money. You have value, or look, you look attractive, so now you must have value, or you're lovable because this partner loves you, or you have freedom because whatever you can pick the brand that you like, you know, whatever it is that we're just grasping on to that constant seeking of next, next, next. That's when I'm just using as the ego.<br>Yeah, denying that we actually intrinsically have value anyway. It's not an actual act of denial. It's that we feel that we don't have value, and so we are frantically grabbing on whatever we can to try to find value. It has to do with naming, naming an illusion like naming a belief. Belief is not always egoic, but many times belief is at you going. You know, we're buying into things, and we're believing in them because it makes us feel better.<br><br><br>A slight change of tack here. You mentioned meditation. Are there any particular meditations? Are there any other tools that you can suggest for people who are on the journey towards away from fear and towards love?<br>Yeah, okay. So, I share a meditation exercise in my book, which is available for free through my website in part four of the book. I don't know if I put a name on it, but it's a verb. It's like a version of transcendental meditation, and I list alternative types of focus that can be helpful. Meditation is very difficult to speak to because we like to label things. Meditation is a move away from the labels towards a full awareness of the present moment itself. <br>It's not thinking a new thought, though it may start as that because we think so much. We're so addicted to thinking that it's okay if meditation begins as establishing a new thought to focus on for a while and just that thought. That's okay, but ultimately, meditation is not about thinking thoughts. It's about a use of one's intent to focus on the present moment fully and to fully be alert, totally alert, without the need to label or think, to just be fully aware. <br>So, there are different exercises that can lead one in that direction. I recommend a very simple exercise actually that still works for me. I recommend like setting aside time, maybe 40 minutes a day sounds like a lot, or you could take less time, but set aside a named amount of time and give yourself permission in that time to sit down, close your eyes, and only focus on a neutral object that you imagine in your mind. If you can visually imagine something, I like to pick like a shape like a square or a triangle and simply draw in your mind the shape and put your full attention on it, not just your thinking mind, but like your whole bodily alert present attention on drawing the shape. Thoughts will arise, especially when you start. What am I going to have for lunch? Or man, I really got to do this thing next week, or I have a pain in my knee, you know, whatever. <br>That's okay. That's totally fine. That's normal. Just keep going back. Go back to it, and you basically you're giving yourself permission to not care about those important thoughts for now, just for these 20 minutes or 40 minutes or whatever it is. Give yourself total permission to not attend to whatever the thought is saying is so important and instead to focus completely on this very neutral thing. Now, the reason this is meaningful is because what you're doing is training your, you're using your intention to train your focus to what you choose rather than being lost in constant thoughts that we dream through all day. You know, like when you think all day, there's only some awareness there. <br>The rest of us is stuck thinking, thinking, thinking. Whereas if we focus and we learn to be able to focus on what we choose without interruption, it opens a space. I like to use the metaphor. It's like standing in a river that's like the water's hitting you like thoughts just keep coming. Meditation is not stopping the water. You can't stop thoughts. Meditation is about standing still in the water, and it's kind of like in a whirlpool in a pool when you go around in circles, you know, and you're making water momentum, and you suddenly stop. <br>The water is going to hit you really a lot at first, but if you just stand there, it'll start slowing down because you're standing still. And so, the practice of meditation is very important and helpful and powerful because over time as you do that, the thought momentum slows such that you will have times when the deeper parts of what you are can arise all on their own. Like, what I mean is as you grow an awareness of what you really are, experiential awareness of awareness versus thoughts and labels, so you're no longer turning to ideas and thinking, you learn to fully feel the aliveness of your awareness itself. <br>And as you do that, like I said, the deeper parts of you will rise up all on their own, and there may be experiences that occur not because you're trying to go and get them necessarily, but because you truly do transcend the physical when you're not so deeply lost in all the thinking about it. The peace and the joy of who we really are can rise up, and even just one moment of really tasting that is worth all the time and all that effort or whatever. It's not ultimately effortful. I'm just saying it seems when you start like you get to put forward an effort. It's worth all of it.<br><br><br>That was kind of a long answer, but all right. There's much to be learned from a long answer. Thank you for taking the time. I have a really important question, which is pretty much the purpose of us having this conversation today, and I really want to know what the impact of knowing that you chose this experience has been on you being able to deal with, integrate, cope with the trauma of being in this physical life.<br>So, first of all, it's incredibly freeing to have no fear of death. I mean, I'm afraid of the dying process, but I have no fear of the end of the physical life. In fact, I'm very much looking forward to it. I don't mean that in a negative way. I'm just very excited. So, that is a big one because a lot of us are running from the idea of our own end. <br>So, when we know that there is truly no end, then life becomes an opportunity. It becomes just like a playground because you do get to use it as a playground. So, that is the first thing. The second thing is we come to find that the awareness that we are is deeper than the pains and limitations that confront us in life. So, and that is a big part of integrating this vibration, this place, is knowing it within who we truly are in a way that we are fully experiencing it and yet not overcome by it. There is an incredible freedom that can take place within one's consciousness as one knows what one truly is and feels that aliveness even as Earth is happening. <br>So, that can be very, very freeing. I'm on this path. I'm certainly no master, but I feel that I have been released from so many old fears and beliefs that I thought were so real that aren't. So many limitations that I thought defined me that don't truly. They're just an experience that I'm experiencing now. I do find in my own case that it also can be difficult in a way because we live in a world that is not very much aware. So, the average vibration, shall we say, is quite low at times. The average level of awareness is not as high as it could be. So, it can be painful to live in a world that is so full of ego and distraction when that is not, that's just so much of it's unnecessary. And also, it can hurt to remember even a small piece of home. <br>That's one of the things that the veil does for us is it prevents us from homesickness because it's very difficult to remain focused into this great limitation when we have some awareness of the incredible freedom and joy and total bliss of what we really are. It makes one miss that and yearn for it in a painful way. But yeah, but overall, it's incredibly freeing to have that awareness, and then as we do that, we're able to, like, as we, if we know who we really are, we're able to live more representation of that. You know, what we really are as free beings of love. <br>So, we can better be that in whatever context, in whatever small way, if we know it. And that sounds so simple like a wordplay or something, but no, that is the very nature of what we're doing on Earth is to try to actualize that love, to try to actually like meet this place and love each other and participate in creation in a deep, real, creative, authentic way. And so, when we have some sense of who we really are, we're much more able to do that, and we're much more able to then give permission to others to do that. And it doesn't even have to be that we perform some action that other people see. We're actually all connected energetically. Like, the collective consciousness of humanity is like one big pond or something. <br>So, when you awake and you process your fears and you bring love into your life even in the smallest way, you know, basically when you choose joy, you are giving permission to all the rest of the collective to choose joy too, even those that you can't see. And that is an incredible effect.<br>So, Christian, I've followed your journey, so I'm pretty okay with the story, your story, and you've talked about making the choices of this life that you're in and seeing the tendrils of choice when you were in between lives, if you like, and like an if-then kind of way of looking at the world. So, please talk to us about the fact that not only have you made a choice about this life and the experiences that you've had, but the fact that we still have some agency while we go along, and it's our fate's not necessarily sealed.<br><br><br>Absolutely. Yeah, so in my pre-life plan, I reviewed what I can only describe as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold. Like, if you laid a tree on its side and started at the trunk and went out to the branches, and I was aware of this. This is very hard to describe, but basically, what it would be like to be me, to be Christian, and to go through these paths. And I could, so there were, how do I describe this, probabilities associated with the paths. <br>Some paths were very likely, and some paths were much less likely, and what would make the path occur or not was my own free will choice-making and also the choice-making of every other player in the game. So, the intention, like I said, to bring down even deeper, the intention that I would wield and the intention that every other person would wield would affect how this might actualize. <br>So, you might think of it like a predictive technology or something like at the beginning of the life, spirit is extremely good at predicting outcome, but it's probabilistic. It's not deterministic. It's not an objective reality. It's a probable, it's an apparently objective reality. It looks objective when we're here, but it's a probabilistic reality that is nudged constantly not only by the actual actions we take but by each and every intention. Each intention that we wield inside of our own minds is actually nudging how the physical actualizes all the time, and we're all doing it whether we know it or not. <br>Some people call that manifestation. You know, that it's just that our consciousness is constantly pushing on the physical. And then once, so, what we're signing up for is a constraint set and a context, and the context will have certain limitations. You know, the body has certain limitations. The circumstances of your family have certain societal limitations, financial limitations, whatever. You know, the full context. You sign up for the context, but then once you're here, you get to make all the choices about how you're going to use that context, what meaning you're going to put on that context, which choices you're going to make. Are you going to make choices out of love or fear? And that free will ability always remains. <br>So, while there is a very clear pre-birth understanding or prediction, I don't really like the word prediction, but we'll use the word prediction, like a pre-birth prediction is seen, there's always free will. There's always free will agency to choose what we will as we go down these paths, and we're completely free to choose whatever we like. Like, it's not like you're totally locked into, you know, nothing is a hundred point zero zero percent. I mean, there's certain things that are extremely likely, you know, but you always have free will to choose what you're going to do with that, and there's a lot more power in that free will than we typically recognize.<br>Excellent. So, I wonder, and again, I'm following threads here rather than set questions, I'm wondering how much access you have to, I guess, the greater consciousness and the concept of why. So, you've addressed the why we're here on Earth, but there must be a greater why. What is the purpose of all this ultimately?<br><br><br>The evolution of love and joy is all is its own why because love and joy are wonderful. So, to participate in the evolution of love, to participate in the expansion of what one is and what all it is is wonderful, and that is a constant process. The process of evolution, spiritual evolution, doesn't ever truly end. I mean, we're constantly growing and refining because that is the nature of all it is. It constantly grows and evolves, and that is a beautiful process. I don't know if that speaks your question, but that's the most succinct way I can think to speak to it. <br>I mean, in my pre-birth experience, I remember coming across a being who had been physical before I had even been physical and feeling the incredible joy and love and power that this being knew and had and was like the quality of his essence was so incredible. And so, you know, what, so why do that? You know, why put ourselves through such incredible constraints to do that? Because we choose. It sounds so simple, but it, you could say because of curiosity even. I mean, it sounds maybe not sufficient, but nothing is actually required of consciousness, of spirit, but we choose to participate in ever and ever greater refinement of being, ever and ever greater evolution for the expansion of love and joy.<br>Christian, with all of this knowledge that you have, this understanding of the life experience and why we're here, is there any final wisdoms you would like to share?<br>I think it's really important, whoever you are listening, to remember that you're not actually human. What you are is you. The you that feels like you to you is who you are. Now, you may think that that you that feels like you to you is exactly your name, your body, your job, your limitations. It's not. You're wearing the context for now, and so while you're wearing that, it is so important to be reminded there's nothing to fear. We absolutely, in the ultimate sense, never have anything to truly fear, never ever ever.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2022/angela-tomlinson-interview-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2022/Angela Tomlinson Interview with Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:03:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Before Human Existence]]></title><description><![CDATA[

After today's interview, if you would like to continue the conversation of all things metaphysical, paranormal, and supernatural, feel free to join our private UMO group by clicking on the link in the video description.<br>Today, our guest is Christian Sundberg. Hello!<br>Christian: Thank you for having me.<br>Julie: Thank you! Oh, I'm so glad you're here. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. We have so much material to cover, so we're going to get right into it. If you wouldn't mind, Christian, can you just give us a little bit of background info on who you are?<br>Christian: Yeah, sure. The "who you are" question is funny because when we ask that question, we're really asking about the forms of your life, what history, what names, what activities can I relate to. Yes, but we are far more than that. But I'll share some of the earthly stuff very briefly. I'm just a regular guy. We're all just regular people having the experience. I worked for 20 years in the manufacturing industry, where I spent 16 years in a nuclear valve manufacturing company, 14 of those as a project manager. So, I'm kind of a normal working professional. That job ended last summer, and I took a new project manager position in January. I took six months off in between to publish a book. But yeah, it's super fun.<br>I'm a father of two beautiful children, a 13-year-old and a 10-year-old, and I'm a husband. I live the standard life for the most part in standard American life, except I am aware on a daily basis that we are not just this human story. So, I do not fully associate with simply the forms of the story, like the profession and the family role. I mean, I know that I am more, and we are more, and this is just something we're here to experience—a very rich, like a virtual reality or a deep play that we're experiencing right now. And so, I'm aware of that on a daily basis, I would say.<br>Julie: Yeah, cool. Okay, would you mind sharing a little bit about your childhood? I usually like to ask my guests if they grew up religious or spiritual, you know, spiritual practices in the home, that kind of thing.<br><br><br>Christian: Okay, so my childhood. When I was very young, I had pre-birth memory. I remembered existing before this human experience. That memory left me completely by the ages of maybe five or six. It returned at the age of 30 when I took up a long-term meditation practice. So, I'm tying that into childhood because that was something that I did remember at the time, but I wasn't aware of that for most of my adult life.<br>I was subsequently raised in a Lutheran household, but my parents were not super religious. It was just something that we did. But I did associate very deeply with that tradition for a while. I was actually an assistant minister in the church for 20 years and considered even going into seminary in my 20s. I always felt that it was difficult for me, however, to get behind a specific structure, and I understand much more why that is now because, after my awakening process at the age of 30, I really became much more fully aware of the limitlessness and the incredible boundless substance of our nature that transcends all of the form of the human experience. And so now, I do not need a form. I still do attend church with my family. We attend the Presbyterian church, and I speak routinely at a Unity church. But it's just a form that we utilize. I didn't understand that as I was growing up, but that's something that's plain to me now. So, that's just a very quick comment on the religious upbringing.<br>Julie: Aside from your pre-birth memories for the first few years of your childhood, did you experience any other kinds of unusual, out-of-the-ordinary, supernatural things—seeing spirits, premonitions, anything like that?<br><br><br>Christian: When I still had the pre-birth memory as a young child, I did have certain experiences that just seemed very normal to me, and I don't know how I would even pick through them to identify what was supernatural versus natural. It's all natural. But as I got older, there is one experience I had when I was 16 that I now understand was an out-of-body experience. It was so real and so lucid and so beautiful. That experience affected me for a long time, but I had no idea what it was. I didn't understand it as an out-of-body experience, but it was very eye-opening even though I didn't understand what I had experienced at the age of 16.<br>Julie: Would you mind just sharing a teeny bit about the OBE?<br>Christian: Okay, yeah. My body was asleep, and I was suddenly in an environment that looked like outside of my house. It was a beautiful summer sunset, and there was wind coming through the trees. It was so realistic and so colorful, and I was so lucid. I remember just walking around, touching things, appraising things. I remember picking up this little pebble off the ground and feeling it between my fingers and noticing how incredibly real it felt. In fact, I could almost discern detail that was even smaller than what I would normally be able to discern. It was so beautiful and so real, and I was just in awe, like, "What am I experiencing right now?" And I remember wanting to be across the street, and I was suddenly there on the other side of the street, which I now understand is quite normal to be able to move with intention in non-physical systems. That's very normal, but at the time, it was just a really beautiful and moving experience that I didn't have any context for.<br>Julie: Right, right. Oh, wow, that's amazing. So, you kind of go through life like every other person, and then around your 30s, you started meditating?<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, so I've always been a spiritual seeker, and I was studying the material of the physicist and consciousness explorer Tom Campbell. The short version of the story is, well, I'll just say one little tidbit. There was one sentence Tom Campbell said in one of his videos that sent me down this entire path of awakening. The one sentence he said was, "What you believe will not get you anywhere particularly important." He meant the nature of the belief itself is not self-justifying. It stung my ego a little bit because, at the time, I believed that my religious belief did give me value. So, when I felt that sting, I was ready to brush it off, but I felt this tiny little nudge rise up within me, which I now understand the way this feels. There's a very particular feeling I understand it to be, probably a guide, but it doesn't need to be labeled. It was just, "Why did that sting?" And I'm like, "Yeah, why did that sting? If it stung, there's a reason."<br>So, I ended up buying his book and reading his thousand-page tome over a period of two years with a pen in hand. But what was more important is that as I read it, he encouraged meditation, and I took up a meditation practice. When I started meditating, at first, I just continued because it felt wonderful. It was relieving to not be lost in thinking all the time. But after a few months, I had my first non-physical experience, and it was very eye-opening. It was like, "Oh my gosh, there really is something greater going on." And as those experiences began to happen more frequently, I also began to have that pre-birth memory return to me. It was the most common thing in the world. It was like someone had blown leaves off of the ground, and there was the grass underneath. Wow, it was just like, "Oh, there's the grass. How did I miss that? How did I forget that was there?" Very normal.<br><br><br>But now that I've had that connection, I think about it every day. I am keenly aware of the veiling process that I experienced when I incarnated, and I feel the presence of the veil now. Metaphorically, I like to relate it to, I don't know, in the cop shows when they have a person sitting in the interrogation room, and there's like a piece of glass, and the cops can see in, but you can't see out. You know, it's kind of like that in consciousness and in the body of my awareness. I can feel it. I can't see out. I can't see past it. I am still veiled. You know, it's there, but I feel it. I know it's there, and I feel that distance, that vibrational distance. And there are moments when I feel aspects of who I really am at times, and it is beautiful and wonderful, and it's hard to not be aware of it. See, because the vibration on Earth is extremely dense, and it's a very low and limited vibration by comparison—very limiting, very defined, very dense. And so, as we get lost in that vibration, it's common to lose sight of the higher context from which we come and to lose sight of the deeper parts of ourselves. But it's wonderful to rediscover that and to feel that, but it is quite a vibrational distance. It's quite like straddling the Grand Canyon or something.<br>Julie: Why do you think you were specifically allowed to have some pre-birth memories?<br>Christian: Well, it's not that I'm special in any way. That's definitely not the case. And it's not like "allowed." Though, in my case, in my pre-birth experience, I did ask the guides to have some memory this time, a little tiny bit. I wanted to not forget everything, and they said that I could do that, but it would make this life more difficult because the contrast between there and here would be even greater. That's one of the functions of the veil—to prevent a very painful homesickness because the higher element of what we are is so high vibration and so free that being veiled is very helpful so that we can completely focus down into this role, this perspective. So, I remember asking that. I still forgot after the age of five or six, like I said. <br>But I don't think it's anything to do with me being special or something. It's just that as we let go of fully our associations with the story of human life and as we fully feel everything that we experience and do not reject and do not block off, those larger parts of ourselves tend to rise up all on their own. You know, we all have a much deeper portion of the self that we typically don't have sight of, but we are absolutely still that. So, it is possible for anyone to be in touch with that at one point or another because it's what we really are, even though the veiling is very effective here. I'm not saying that. I mean, this is an extremely effective simulation going on on Earth, and I know how this sounds. You know, I know how crazy this sounds, but it is like an extremely effective simulation that we are not bound into. It feels like we're bound, but we're not actually bound. It's a deeply convincing vibrational place and set of perspectives, set of perceptions and thoughts that we tend to lose ourselves within.<br>Julie: Before I ask you some questions that I have on my mind, do you want to share a little bit about what you started remembering exactly?<br>Christian: Yeah, sure. Well, I'll just share some. I've shared it a number of times. I don't want to take too much time, but I'll just say that I remember, oh boy, okay, so this is very hard to put into language. I just have to disclaim this because there is no language to describe our higher nature or the higher realms from which we come because our language is based on our local world. You know, our language is basically forms and symbols and assumptions of Earth. There are certain assumptions on Earth that we hold to be absolutely true that aren't, like, for instance, linear time and discrete location. Those are two big ones. <br>We just assume all of reality exists in a way where we are separate from reality and we're in a discrete place, and everything else is too. That's not true. That's a non-native experience that we agree to have for a while. So, I say that before I say anything because language is so limited that as soon as we open our mouths and start putting our limited, crude symbols on it, it just ruins, to a large part, what really is going on. It's part of our limiting experience that we wanted to have rather than just have telepathy and send you my thoughts and images. Yeah, no, telepathy is the normal state of communication. We don't have that here typically because this place is a deep experience of separation. <br>That's one of the elements of Earth—the separateness that we experience. And so, being able to experience being separate means we feel like our thoughts are our own. Nobody else can see them or hear them. You're out there; I'm over here, and I have to throw words at you, and you have to throw words back. But the thing is, that's not really there. There's no such thing as separateness or privacy, for that matter. It's all seen; it's all known.<br>Anyway, so that is something we experience here, and that's particular and peculiar to Earth. Speaking is very frustrating. I commonly express my frustration with words to my wife, just constantly saying, "Why do we have to use life?"<br>Okay, so all that being said, I remember a long time ago, before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical and feeling in the substance of this being's nature this incredible power and joy and freedom. And I asked him—this is telepathic, not words—but I asked him, "My goodness, do you feel as full of joy and power and freedom as I feel that you were experiencing?" And he shared with me, yes, I could feel in him what he experienced. <br>And I said, "My goodness, how did you do that? How did you become this? How did you come to know this depth of joy and expansiveness?" And one of the things he shared with me was that he had lived physical lives, and there was one in particular in which he had been dealing with a very painful chronic condition of some kind. And the way that he met that pain, the way that he met that limitation, allowed this incredible refinement and expansion of who he was. And I asked him, "My goodness, were you healed?" You know, because I could feel how deeply he had been damaged in this life, and he shared, yes. And I felt the depth of the healing, and I said, "I want to do that. I'm going to do that." Like, I was so inspired, and he kind of not brushed me off but kind of said like, "Yeah, that's what they all say. You don't know how hard this is, and you just don't know."<br>Julie: Were you saying you wanted to have a human physical life or you wanted to suffer?<br><br><br>Christian: I wanted to have a physical life and participate in that type of expansion. It wasn't about wanting to suffer. It was about wanting to engage that type of limitation to grow and expand. Okay, also because the joy and the love and the power and the freedom that is knowable and expressible and actualizable grew so much in this being, and I wanted to know that and experience that and be that. It was about being more, you could say. Maybe that's not the right way to put it because our true nature—maybe I don't like those words—but something like that. It's about participating in expansion.<br>So, he told me, "Go talk to your guides," and I did. I don't have right after that, but I know I lived many times, and I went back and found this being later, and I shared with him, "See, I'm doing this. I'm on the path," and he was encouraging.<br>So, the majority of my pre-birth memories of enough time, somewhat immediately preceding this lifetime, I had taken a long break after a previous life, and this guide kept coming to me and asking, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And I put him off time and again for a while, and eventually, I said, "Okay, I'm ready." And then I reviewed with this guide what I can only describe as my state—like who I was, who I had been, what I had known, what I had done. <br>And it was very obvious the thing that I needed to—I don't like the words "work on"—the thing it was like, the state of being that had bested me, that it would be best for me to integrate a certain very low vibration, a certain fear that had overcome me that I wanted to integrate. And it was so profoundly low vibration, and I asked him, "Has it ever been done in all of creation? Like, has any other being ever integrated something this low?" And he shared, "Yes, and you have all of time available to you to do so. There's no hurry." And I just knew in that state, if it can be done, I will do it.<br><br><br>So, he brought me—they brought me; there's multiple guides—brought me a life that was very perfect for this intention, very high match. Okay, and this wasn't this life, though. It was immediately preceding life. All right, and I reviewed that life in great detail, and I accepted the life. And then I remember accepting the veil. Okay, the veil is just a word. It means the limitations in consciousness space that go along with having the physical experience. <br>And the way I can best describe this because this is what's like so close in the forefront of my mind now—it's like having, okay, imagine being so expanded and connected to everything and having all knowledge and all-knowing and all freedom and power at your disposal in the body of your awareness, and then having that plummet down in vibration and having all your knowing be cut off. It's like, so I like to describe it like an amplifier that produces a pitch, and then you turn down the dial, and then when you get to the bottom, you turn it down some more, and then more and then more and more, and then you keep turning down more and then turn it down some more. That was what it was like plummeting all the way down into this physical place, and it was like arriving to like the vacuum of space—just a metaphor—like a place with no heat and no substance and yet extremely dense and cramped and limiting.<br>And so, when I arrived, I immediately said, "I am not doing this. This is—" I had fear rise up, and I was so overcome by this fear, and I said, "There's no way I am living a whole lifetime in this state." I felt like I had lost all that I was. So, I fought back. I summoned my might, my strength, and I fought my way back out past the veil, and I had a life review because I became aware that I had killed the fetus that was to be my body. <br>I was in the womb, but I had ended that life, and I became aware of how I had affected the mother and not only the poor mother but hundreds of other people who were affected by the mother because I had heaped grief upon her by my own fear. And so, I couldn't believe that I had done that. You know, like I had these big intentions, this positive plan, this intention to help and to expand and to participate in a constructive way, and then this is what I had done because of my fear. And I said, "I really got to do something about this fear. I really have a lot of fear."<br><br><br>Okay, so for the sake of time, I'll just kind of jump a bit. So, I still wanted to do this, so they brought me this life, and this life was not as good of a match as the previous one, but it was pretty good. Okay, I'm just making up numbers here, but if the first one was like 99, this one was like 87 or something. I don't know; it's not really numbers. I'm just making up numbers to communicate the point, but it was pretty good. It was good enough. <br>And I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail, reviewing all at once millions and millions of possibilities in this huge, like I described, like a flow chart, like a tree that you laid on its side. Let's start at the trunk and move out to the branches, like a flow chart of all these possibilities of what could or was likely or less likely to happen in the life and what it would be like to experience being me in these branches. And I made certain requests. I asked for certain traits and qualities, and I knew that this life would give me the opportunity to re-engage a very low vibration fear and that I would likely be traumatized in my 20s and crushed by a traumatic experience, and that did happen.<br>Okay, yeah, so I accepted the life, and once again, I remember the veil coming over me and then plummeting down, down, down, down, and eventually arriving at this place where this time I just tried not to fight it because I just didn't want to reject it again. So, I held on and held on and held on, and I just focused on not pushing back, not fighting, and eventually, I sent one message, one ping back to the technician beings that had helped me accept the veil, "Did it take?" And they sent one ping back, "Yes." So, I knew I had made it. I felt really accomplished that I had even made it to the physical. It was like such a big accomplishment even making it.<br>So, I was there for a while, and then after a while, I'm like, "You know what? I am not doing this. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I am not myself." And so, once again, I began to summon my might and my strength to fight my way out again, and when I did that, this most holy moment of my entire life happened where the great spirit of God came to me and expanded me back out, and I felt the whole universe within me, and I felt our sun churning with bliss in me, and I felt just endless love and bliss, and the spirit said to me, "This is still what you are.<br>You can never not be this." So, I relaxed at last, like, "Oh, that's still what I am. That's wonderful because I knew that I didn't have to fight because I wasn't losing who I was. Right, I was still that." So, I let go, and I was in the womb for a while, and the next memory I have is of being born. I remember the shock of being born and the sensory experience but no intellectual understanding at all, just being super curious and looking up at the beings who were taking care of me, the nurses and whoever else, and just being like, "Wow, who are these beings? What is this experience?" And yeah, so that's a short version of the story.<br><br><br>I know people find that very interesting and fascinating, you know, the ego-like stories. I don't think it's that important actually. You know, I share it because I think it can be helpful. I think it's far more important to focus on who we really are because that—what I experienced in the womb—is what we all really are.<br>Julie: Can I ask you a question going back a little bit to the first one that you rejected right before this life? Do you have any ideas of why they didn't give you that same feeling to keep you going?<br>Christian: I don't know. No idea. I have no idea.<br>Julie: Do you think if they hadn't done that, you would have maybe pushed yourself out, and the fetus would have been in this life?<br>Christian: Yeah, this one. Yeah, if they had not done it, I suspect so, but I don't know because from that level, the understanding is profoundly different, and there's a breadth of seeing and that breadth of understanding that I can't possibly surmise what would have happened or what wouldn't have happened.<br><br><br>Julie: The fear that you felt when you were in the womb—what was that from?<br>Christian: Oh, well, it was from being limited and being constrained and having all of who I am be cut off. I felt like I lost all that I am. I felt like all of the—you could say all the treasures of my soul were gone.<br>Julie: Do you think we, maybe all of us, then go through something like that when we go into the womb?<br>Christian: Yes, I mean, I can only speak from my own experience, but it seems very likely to me that we all experience something extremely similar. We choose to forget all of the rest of what we really are. It's like partitioning a portion of the self, you could say, down into the human character, and the human character is like a blank slate. It's not that it doesn't have access to everything, but it's still the same you. That's the key; that's really important. It's still the same being.<br>Like, okay, so I once had an experience after meditation where I thought I was done meditating, and I sat down in my chair a few minutes later, and all of a sudden, I experienced all these orbs. I saw all these orbs, and I knew that every one of them was a life that I lived, and I was those people. It wasn't like I thought, "Well, if reincarnation is real, then maybe those are other people, and I'm them." No, no, no, this was like the me that feels like me to me like right now did other things, was other people. It wasn't like other people; it was like I have been a woman. That's pretty cool. Yeah, I have been a woman who gave birth, for instance, and that's the same me, even though right now that me, the feeling of me, is associated to some extent with the name Christian and with the story of Christian. I know that that's not all of what I am.<br>So, I'm saying that in a context because, yes, in order to have the fresh start and the new experience of this human experience, we become veiled to the rest of what we are so that we can totally focus here and develop a new personality, you know, free from the history of previous experiences, like being influenced.<br>Julie: These orbs, these other lives—are they linear, or were they going on all at the same time? I don't know if you can answer that.<br>Christian: Yeah, no, well, this might sound like a cheat, but I felt like it was both. I think it's all at once, but there's also sequence. So, I don't know how to describe that. Yeah, like my pre-birth memory also feels like all these events that I just described taking place all at once and right now, not in the past, but in the past too. They also feel like they're 10,000 years old. So, but there is sequence; there's like spirit sequence, but it's also all in the one now. So, I don't know how to describe that. That's a tough one.<br>Julie: And where all of these orbs—human lives on this planet Earth, or all over the place?<br>Christian: I only know specifically for three of them. I know I lived at least one as a human woman, and I know I lived at least one life as a not as a human but in some kind of civilization that was very advanced—okay, physical—some physical life. I don't know anything about it except for very limited imagery, and I know I lived one life as a non-human creature on Earth.<br>Julie: That sounds true. Yeah, I know that sounds super strange.<br>Christian: I remember being a bird. I know this sounds super crazy.<br>Julie: Oh, a bird? Oh, okay, a migrating bird. Gotcha.<br>Christian: Okay, I know that sounds super woo-woo.<br>Julie: No, that doesn't get it to me, probably not my listeners.<br>So, I'm curious if you know, and it's okay if you don't know the answer, just say you know, I don't know. I appreciate your honesty, but yeah, these other lives—do they also get the veil of forgetfulness, you know, on these other planets, for example, if you lived a life as an ET or a bird?<br>Christian: That's a really good question. So, I can only share what I know. So, I know that in order to be physical, there is some level of veiling, but the level of veiling is unique per body and per collective consciousness that one is a part of. So, there is some veiling. I don't know the difference. I can't possibly speak to the difference in veiling, but I know that, like, being human, for instance, is a very highly sought, high-opportunity context that is very limiting. <br>And like, when you come into this context, you're becoming part of the collective consciousness of the human species—all the thought objects of humanity and all the history, right? And there's a lot of low-vibration stuff in there, yes. And so, the veiling has to be to a certain extreme way.<br>I suspect—I don't know for certainty—but I suspect that for any other civilizations that might be out there that are higher vibration, I suspect the veiling is less, but I don't know that. I do know there are other universes that we could possibly engage, and that our physical universe is an extremely low vibration. When I say low vibration, I just mean extreme limitation, not negative. It's not actually a negative context of high limitation that we apply the meaning to. That's really important, but it is highly limiting. It's a very constraining experience, very highly constraining state of being to be physical in our universe.<br>Julie: Do you know if, because you got to remember some of your memories, some of your pre-birth memories, and you said that's a sort of a constraint or you said something about contrast—that's what you said—so it makes this life more difficult the more memories we have because of that homesickness? Now, I know plenty of people who have a homesickness, and they have no pre-birth memories, no memories of past lives, but they just have this deep yearning, like, "I don't really belong here, and I really want to go home. I don't know where that is." We so many of us feel like that for a good reason.<br><br><br>Christian: We feel that homesickness because this is an alien state. I mean, I'm not saying it's like getting in an astronaut suit and going into outer space. You can clunk around, but you're just that; you're not really your full self. You're clunking around in space. It's kind of like that. It's like the body is like a spacesuit. You could think of it like a way to engage a physical environment.<br>So, regarding whether or not, I just know that I knew that having some memory would create a very painful homesickness because the yearning to be there would be overwhelming. It could be prohibitive. Like, you wouldn't be able to get up and go to work in the morning.<br>Julie: Yeah, yep. You know, I wonder if it would decrease the population in a self-initiated way if everybody had all of their memories. I don't know, just the thought of past life memories or who we are in between lives. I don't know, but it seems that on some of these other realities—physical, non-physical—we do have more information.<br><br><br>Christian: Well, I will say that as we gain awareness, if we really are love—our true nature—so, I wouldn't necessarily say that that conclusion is likely because, okay, we know that there's value in this. This life is incredibly valuable and precious and not to be taken lightly, not to be thrown away. And when there's fear, fear is an opportunity, not something to be escaped actually. It is a sign of yet unevolvingness. It's just fear is a sign that there's some experience that we have yet to integrate or some perception that we have yet to integrate.<br>So, when there's so, I'm saying that because usually when someone wants to bring the experience to an end, there's a profound fear that's taken hold. I am not making light of that at all because I have come to face fear, and I've had a heck of a lot of fear in my experience. I had PTSD for a number of years in my 20s, and I've since integrated it very deeply, this fear. Okay, so I don't say it lightly, but I'm just saying that fear is a sign that there's some part of our experience we've rejected and not fully integrated yet. And ego, by the way, is a sign of fear. Ego arises out of fear. <br>So, where we are egoic and where we seek to justify the self at the expense of others, there's some lesson, there's some fear down there that the ego is trying to speak away, talk away, "Oh no, you have power because look, you can hurt this person next year, or you have value because you belong to this group, or you have value because you have money in your bank account or you're attractive or whatever." That's just the simple ego game that we play to try to get back that power or that worthiness that seems to have been lost in coming here but was never truly lost.<br>Julie: How many lives do you think we need to experience to, like, with the one guide that you kind of looked up to, I guess, so to speak, "Oh, I want it, I want that"? Is there a number of lives that we have to check off, or is it difficult?<br>Christian: Okay, so first of all, I say that we have choice. There's always choice. It's not "need to"; it's a bit like saying, "How many classes do you want to go to in college?" or "How many runs do you want to go on in order to get your body stronger?" You know, it's a little bit like that. I mean, it's a rough, very crude metaphor, so I'm just saying that we have the choice. The choice is ours.<br>So, but then how many? So, I mean, we won't do it forever. You don't go to school forever. You know, you don't go running all the time. Again, these are crude metaphors. I'm just saying we choose to come, and there is some limitation, but how many? I don't know. I'm not going to take a guess, but I will say that the way that we choose to meet this moment, this experience, is so profoundly powerful. I strongly feel that if someone fully utilizes this life, it is very likely worth many other experiences where someone is resisting and not integrating and not growing. I think we can accomplish an awful lot in one experience if we're willing to face our fears and grow in love, if we're really willing to own our own crap.<br>You know, this is not about, "Oh, I just need to learn some new idea, and then I pass." No, this is not about that. It's about who you are. It's about how you meet reality, and where you don't have joy right now, there is some opportunity for growth, even if your limitations are extreme. So, those extreme limitations just mean extreme opportunity. So, I'm saying that in the context of your question because we have a profound opportunity in our lives as physical beings to integrate experience and to grow towards love. That's what this is all about. This is all about love. It's all about growing towards love and expanding as creative, loving beings.<br><br><br>Julie: I'm gonna throw out a difficult question. I think it's a difficult question. If we're already love on the other side—that's where we've come from—why would we need to come here to learn it more? So, does that make sense?<br>Christian: Yeah, of course. Okay, so the substance of what we are is love. So, we could say consciousness itself is made of love, and it has no need. It has no requirement put upon it. It is what it is. It is what exists. Yeah, yep. Okay, so then, if there is to be expansion, if there is to be any growth, any growth of love and joy, then there is to be a process of evolution and expansion. That means—I'm trying to be careful because the language is really tricky—but it means that we can use contrast. We can use situations of limitation and context that are well-defined for the purposes of expanding that which really is. So, we're using a non-sense. We're using a non-real thing, and I say non-real like our experience here is real, right? But the objects aren't really real. The bodies aren't really real. Yeah, the thoughts aren't really even real. They're all forms, right, that we are using, and we're seeing how consciousness uses them.<br>Okay, so but then when we drop the forms and we're free, what we still are remains. We always were consciousness. We were then; we will be after, but now, through form, through the tool of form, through the tool of creation and contrast, we have learned how to do something differently. And what is that something? Use our intent. So, intent is the primary action. Consciousness, you can say, is the fundamental substance of what is, and intent is its fundamental action. And so, if you can engage form in a way that is more in alignment with the truth of our being, which is love and freedom and joy, even when the limitations are great, then that substance expands out to that.<br><br><br>I'm sorry, we're getting excited. So, if you take, okay, so I'll use a metaphor here. So, if the sun is source, and we're a piece of it, and we go out—get around the microphone stand—if we go out this far, yeah, or maybe this far, or maybe even all the way out here, really far away, and then we integrate this experience, yes, yes, and there is this expansion of being all the way out to here, and that expansion is not just an expansion of self; it is an expansion of all that is.<br>Julie: Well, what I'm hearing, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that source is evolving through our experiences, through every—<br>Christian: Yeah, the problem with duality and dualistic language that we're really relying on is if we say yes, that means that the no is not true, and they're both. But yes, it sounds like a paradox. Some of these paradoxes sound like paradoxes only because we believe duality is fundamentally real, and it's not. Yeah, so it's only from within the framework of duality that these things look like paradoxes, but yes, there is a constant evolution that is transpiring. All that is is ever, ever, ever becoming more. And what is—I think that's actually Tom Campbell's theory as well.<br>Julie: Yes, yeah, he speaks about, yeah, his acronym is AUM—Absolute Unbound and Manifold—that's what he calls the source.<br>Christian: Oh, and he calls that, uh, seer. I think the AUO is the some other acronym for the unexpanded source versus expanded source. He gets kind of technical about it, which is fine. Yeah, physicist. I mean, again, we're in duality, so we like to think, "What's the beginning? What's the end? What's the product? What's the goal?" We know, of course, that's right, and we know finish. <br>Where's the goal? Absolutely. Yeah, the thing is love and joy and creativity are the goal because that's what we—I like that—we choose because we're curious beings. We're curious, powerful, free beings. We're so free that we can choose to have an experience of incredible limitation where we even experience being not free. How crazy is that? That's crazy. That's what we're doing. Like, "What was I thinking? What was my higher self thinking?" It's like climbing Mount Everest. Not everybody climbs Mount Everest, but some people want to do that. Well, we are those who are doing that.<br>Julie: Yes, yes, we're climbing the Mount Everest of diving so deep into the experience of separation that we have forgotten we are unconditionally loved.<br>Christian: Wow, and mastering that perspective allows us to forever know—and when I say know, I mean understand personally and feel—what unconditional love really is, really means, in a way that beings who have never experienced that contrast don't know. Like I said, contrast is a creative tool. It's being used in a way that adds. It's an additive use, not just a limiting use.<br>Julie: So, I don't want to push this point too much because I want to move on to something else, but someone might say, "Some might find the Earth has gotten a little out of hand. Humanity has gotten a little too extreme with some of the, shall I say, unconscionable cruelty and violence. And aren't there other physical realities that you can have an extreme contrast and these limitations without all of this other stuff that's gone so extreme?"<br>Christian: Yeah, that's a hard question. No, it's gonna—that's good. So, okay, now, first of all, there, even a small act of inflicting pain on another is an intention rooted in fear. Even a small one of those is unacceptable in the context of total unconditional love and freedom and joy. And when I say unacceptable, I don't mean—okay, I want to be careful about that. I'm just saying that I don't want to draw a huge distinction and say, "Oh, the Earth is so bad, so if we just had it one-tenth as bad, that would be okay." You know, maybe four-tenths is bad is okay, maybe seven-tenths is bad, but eight-tenths, that's not okay. You know, there's—we love duality, so we love drawing spectrums and saying somewhere it's not acceptable. Well, guess what? None of it is acceptable. It's what you're saying ultimately.<br><br><br>Well, okay, but if it was totally unacceptable, it wouldn't be existing. Like, we wouldn't be here. There's a deeper process going on. Okay, so the reason I'm highlighting that distinction is because this is actually a neutral context. We apply the meaning to it, and this is just what we have done with this context. We who have a lot of fear—it's like several billion kindergarteners being handed scissors and being left alone, and then this is what happens. And in this case, this classroom is extremely limiting because they don't remember they're connected. They all have fear. Look at what happens. This is what we're doing. This is what's happening. So, I'm not making light of the extremity of the suffering. I am not making light of it. I'm just saying this is the natural result when you give free will beings who have yet to make love-based choices and they make fear-based choices in this context free reign.<br>And this is who we are. Like, the world is who we are. The world is what we are, and we love to blame the world, and we love to blame even spirit. "How can this be?" Yeah, we stab each other, and then we say, "How can this be?" Well, we hurt others because we're hurt, and we're hurt because they're hurt, and on and on in this chain down our species. But now, we are seeking to step past that, to grow, and actually integrate these fears and actually expand. That's what the awakening is. It's a shift in consciousness and higher vibration where we are seeking to actually engage these limitations in a new way and to overcome these great difficulties that have been so deeply rooted in our history.<br>Now, are there other realities that are less limiting? Yes, yeah, there are. Are there mountains shorter than Mount Everest? Yeah.<br>Julie: I've heard that Earth is one of the most—this is what I've heard—one of the most difficult realities to incarnate into. That was my understanding at the time.<br>Christian: Oh, okay. Was that—this is, I mean, I'm not—I can only share what I remember. I'm not saying I have all the answers. I'm just saying that I remember knowing, "Oh, like this whole universe is like taking it to like the most, the new most extreme level." Like, there have been universes before this universe, and they in-breathe and out-breathe, and each time, they're, "Oh, you can take it to a newer level." Okay, like leveling up in a game. Yes, it is like leveling up in a game, and right now, we're on a high difficulty level, and in this one, we're running around feeling separate as heck, feeling a lot of fear, and then we're like, "Wow, why are we all hurting each other so much?" Well, it's because of our own fear.<br>So, fear is the only—there's only really two problems: fear and ignorance. Those are the only real two problems. Limitation is not actually the problem. Limitation is just an opportunity. Yeah, that makes sense. Limitation is just an opportunity to experience and work through fear primarily. I say ignorance secondarily because right now, our world just tends to not be aware of the larger context very much. I mean, it's growing, but we don't have a super positive trajectory. I guess I should say positive, or we're awakening.<br>So, eventually, it would appear that when spirits choose to incarnate, maybe this won't be the hardest one anymore to incarnate onto. Maybe there'll be some other universe that's more difficult. I don't know. I think that's very likely, but I don't know. I just mean, if there's been universes before, which I remember, so that implies that may occur again. Yeah, but the thing is, whenever we talk about this, the human tends to think, "Oh my God, there's so much suffering. I don't like this. This sounds like bad news. I don't want more of this." Yeah, yeah.<br>Well, let me just say that it's important to recognize though that the suffering—our own suffering is, in many cases, not always, but in many cases, because of our own fear and our own yet unevolvingness. And so, when we feel that way in response to the world, it's a sign that we have an opportunity to grow because the very ascended beings, the masters, they can live even here with great joy and peace, and they can help many, many other people, even if they can't help every single other person in a physical sense, right? They live lives that are full, and they meet this present moment without all those burdens and stresses, and they help many, many people. And by the way, not just physically.<br>When we meet our own fear, we are helping the entire collective because we're a part of one like pond, and when you change your light, all that you're giving permission to everybody else in consciousness space that's connected. We're all connected. So, even if you don't physically go out and do something, if you meet your own fear on your own, if you make the loving choice—and love has so many things that it means: the compassion, the kind choice—if you decide to be brave enough to challenge your beliefs where necessary, if you take ownership for the way that you're treating your dog, whatever—you are a part of the solution. You are part of this solution of the whole thing. And now, I don't want to even say just part of the solution; that is the movement and the healing of the world.<br>But instead, we tend to get so lost in hopelessness and in the scope. The whole play around us is just a play. It's not even fundamentally real, but we feel so overpowered by it. The spiritual message is one of empowerment. It's one of knowing that you are absolutely powerful and free, and no matter how limited and extreme this may get, you have the power to heal and to meet your fear and to help the world and to find joy in this moment. Joy is our birthright. It's who we are. This is not just a world of cruelty and suffering.<br>Julie: Well, I cannot believe we are getting really to our time here, our time limit, and I don't want to run out of time before you have a chance to share about your book and maybe if you're working on any projects and how listeners can connect with you. I'm going to put all these links up in the video description.<br>Christian: Okay, yeah, thanks. So, my website is awalkinthephysical.com. The book is called A Walk in the Physical as well, and it is available for free on my website at the third link down on the book page. It's not about money. Anyone can access the book. I spent about six years writing the book. I felt intuitively guided through this process, and it is a reality model that helps to encourage the individual to sense and find who they really are and to hopefully meet reality in a way that is closer to the freedom and love of who we really are. So, it's meant to be a helpful tool.<br>You can also reach me by email. Sometimes I get a lot of emails, and so I really apologize if I can't respond to everybody, but it's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com</a>, and I'll try to respond as best as I can. I have a lot of one-on-one requests. I'm happy to do them, but I'm a bit behind, but I'm happy to meet with anybody who would like as long as I can find the time to do so. I don't charge anything. It's just to help.<br>Julie: Lovely, thank you. And there's a bunch of talks on—one last thing—I've shared many in many other videos, so if this is helpful, there's a talks page on my website with all sorts of talks I've shared, and so that's available also for anyone who's interested.<br>Christian: Wow, cool.<br>Julie: And what I like to do, Christian, before I sign off, is leave my guest with the last words. So, anything that you feel like, "Oh, I really wanted to cover this," or words of encouragement, anything on your heart?<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, so whoever you are listening today, I know this sounds super strange: you are not human. And what I mean is, you are the you that feels like you to you—that true you that is joyful and free. That's who you really are, and you don't have to take the human play so seriously. All the labels of the story—it's just a story. You get to decide what the labels are. You get to decide how to relate to your story or what story to make. You are free to do that. So, please be encouraged as you walk, as you go through life, to know that it's okay if you have fear. <br>You can meet fear, and you can actually heal it. And this whole thing is just a huge, fun experiment, and there is no death at the end of it. Like, we're so afraid of avoiding this death thing. You don't die. You're not going to die. Whoever you are listening today, you're not going to die. You're going to be you, and in fact, more you when all the constraints of the human limitations are just let go and released. You know, you're not going to die. Your consciousness seamlessly continues. So, please be reminded of that so that you know, as we remember that, I feel like we can meet life with just that bit more, and that bit more is a lot—that bit more of happiness and freedom. And you have the freedom to make those choices and to use your story or make your story however you like.<br>Julie: Wonderful. Thank you so much. Yeah, that's awesome. And thanks, Christian, for hanging out and spending time. I know you're a busy guy, so I appreciate it.<br>Christian: No problem. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.<br>Julie: Absolutely. And thank you to everyone watching. This has been Julie McVay with Unordinary Made Ordinary, and I hope you will join us next time for another fascinating interview.

 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=7PO-Op38o-k<br>3 FEB 2022<br><br><br>Well, thank everybody for coming. Okay, so I have a 30-minute slot, so we're gonna dive right in. There are four topics I want to discuss today. First, I want to try to put some words to my pre-birth memory itself, just as context. Then, I'd like to talk about reasons we come to Earth, why we're doing this. Two, why the veil is important, and that is why we become veiled and do not remember the totality of who we really are while we're having a human experience, why that's important and necessary. And three, why love is so important. You know, when we hear all this about love, why is love so integral to this journey? What's the larger conceptual context for that?<br>Okay, so before I dive in, I just have to disclaim: these things are completely and totally beyond language. You know, we, when we're on Earth, we tend to believe that all of reality is like Earth. We learn the context of Earth, and then we have certain assumptions we buy into, and we think those assumptions must apply everywhere, like assumptions like linear time and discrete location, distance, even separation itself. Those are not fundamental properties that apply to all systems. So, it's very difficult to take human language and try to put it on these experiences. It just doesn't do it any justice at all.<br><br><br>Okay, so long, long ago—and this seems so totally ancient to me, and yet it feels like it's happening right now—I came across this being who had been physical. This was before I had had any physical incarnations at all, actually. And I remember being completely overwhelmed by the beauty and the power of this being. His nature was so full of light and joy and power, and I felt it from him. And I asked him, "My goodness, like, what did you do to become this?" And this is telepathic; it's not words because, on that side, there's a sharing of information. There's just a sharing of the being of who one is, and you can feel what they feel, and they feel you, and it's a very complete and instantaneous sharing.<br>And I said, "My goodness, look what you've become. What could you possibly have done to be this?" And he shared with me that he had lived physical lives. And he shared with me, in specific, that one life he had suffered a long physical ailment, a pain or a sickness of some kind. I don't know exactly what it was, but an ailment that was very difficult for him every day. And the way that he chose to meet that experience allowed a—this is really hard to explain or describe—but a refinement of his nature. You know, who he really was was able to refine and grow through his integration of this experience.<br>And I said, "I want to do that. I'm going to do that. I want to do that." I was really fired up and inspired. And he said something kind of along the lines of, "Yeah, that's what they all say. It's hard in a way you don't know." And I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do it."<br>And then I remember reviewing with this guide what I can only describe as like my state, who I was, what I had been, what I had known. And it was very clear the thing that I needed to—I don't like the word "work on"—but the thing I needed to experience or do, the process. And the best way I can describe it in English is to say it was like a fear. It was a low-vibration perception that bested me in a previous experience and had led me into a place where I had become a very damaging person. And it was so dauntingly low vibration that even there I asked, "Is it even possible? Is it possible for any being to meet an experience of this low vibration, this much pain and fear, and integrate and heal it? Has it ever been done in all of creation?"<br>And the guide showed, "Yes, it has been. And you have all time given to you. You don't have to do it all at once." And so, I knew from that point of view, like, if it can be done, I will do it. And that sounds kind of foreign to me here, you know, as a human, because it can be very daunting at times. But at that point, I just knew I could do it.<br>So, they brought me a life, a lifetime, a physical life that was appropriate for this intention of mine. And I reviewed that life, and I accepted it. And I knew that that life and all of the context that was involved in that life was extremely appropriate for my intention. You know, it was just a really good match.<br><br><br>And so, I remember going to this place where I needed to accept the veil. The veil is just a term, but it's just the word we use for the constraints that one must surrender to in order to have the physical experience from the fully immersed human vantage point. And I remember so, I remember having this veil come over me. And I like to describe it like if you have an amplifier that produces a sound pitch, and then you turn the knob down, and then you turn down some more, and then when it gets to the bottom, you turn down some more, more and more and more, keep turning it.<br>That's what it felt like in the body of my being to plummet down, down, down, down, down, down, down from this place of all connectedness and knowing. Like, I just knew all of myself, and I knew all that is, and I just knew I was connected to everything. To have that feel like it was being erased and obscured for me and feeling like I was plummeting down to this very dense location where it was like there was no heat and no air. It was just like a vacuum that was also dense. That's kind of what it felt like to be bodily.<br><br><br>And so, after I did that, I saw that I was in the womb as an unborn child. And I was only there for a short time, and I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this." Because I had so much fear rise up immediately because I felt like all of who I was had been cut off. And so, I was like, "I'm not doing this." And I summoned my strength, my might, and I fought my way out again. I pushed back past the veil, and I was able to do that. I successfully returned to the other side, but I became immediately aware that I had inadvertently killed the fetus. I killed the body that was to be mine. <br>And I had a life review for that super, super short life. I don't know how long I was there, but it was super short. But I could see and feel and know how I had negatively impacted the mother, and not only the poor mother who was now in grief, but hundreds of other people, like ripples in a pond away from the mother. Hundreds of other people whose journeys were going to be made more difficult because of my fear. And I had all these great intentions, but I could see that I had only heaped difficulty on the journeys of these other beings who I so loved and respected. I mean, these beings who had the courage and the strength to be human. It was like I couldn't believe I made their journey more difficult.<br><br><br>So, okay, so I'm going to jump a bit. Okay, so that life opportunity was wasted, but I still wanted to do this. So, they brought me this life, this current life that I'm in right now. And this life was not as perfectly—you know, not a perfect match like the other one was. It was still pretty good, though. It was good enough. <br>And I remember reviewing what I can only describe as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold. It was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side, and it was thick at the trunk at the start, and then as you worked your way out, you got into the branches. It was kind of like that, except it was like what it would be to be me, to be Christian, the human, in all these possible avenues. And there were some that were very likely to occur and some that were much less likely. <br>And it was both my decisions and the decisions of all the other players in the game, the free will choices of the people that were involved, all of us that would influence how it would actualize after I got here.<br>So, I was super excited, and I remember asking certain questions and requesting certain things. I remember saying, "Well, I'd like to be intelligent in this life again," because I knew that I had been intelligent in past experiences. And they said, "Yes, I could do that." And I remember knowing that it would be important that I'd be a male because, just, it's a certain quality of energy. <br>I don't mean to say males and females are different in this regard, but being a male has certain qualities to it that were helpful to me to meet this fear that I was coming to face. And I knew that the confidence my father would instill in me would strengthen me and give me a rock to stand on so I would be able to meet this fear. And I knew that it was very likely that when I was 22—or actually, I'm sorry, the age wasn't known—I knew it was in my early 20s, and it did happen when I was 22, that I would experience a trauma, and it would crush me and allow me to re-experience that fear. And that eventually did happen.<br><br><br>Okay, so then, I remember there happened to be a moment to actually say yes. And I don't remember that moment, but I do remember just after that, being in this place where I was basically like waiting. And then this guy coming to me and saying, "Go now, like right now," almost kind of rude, like, to get me onto the Earth time or something. Like, I was in the state that was like not, and it was like really important I go right now. And so, then the next thing, I was with these beings that I can only describe as technicians or tinkerers. They're very mechanical in nature. <br>And they do this thing, at least for me, where they take, they match the veil to you. So, like, the soul has all these rich qualities, and the life and the body and the context have their own thing going on. And they do this thing where they, I don't know, they make it all energetically fit. And they did that, and they asked me one last time, "Are you sure that you want to do this? Because once you say yes here, you're in for the ride. Like, there's no getting off the roller coaster after you press this button." And I said, "Yes."<br><br><br>And then I remember once again the veil coming over me and my energy plummeting down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. And this time, just basically choosing not to fight, just surrendering my control and letting the veil come over me and, like, hold on to me and allow it to work through me the way that it would and not fight it. And I did that. And so, then I was here in this very, very, very low-vibration state by comparison. I felt like I lost all of who I really was. I knew I was here, and I sent this one message back through this little tiny window—it seemed like a window, not really a window—back to the technicians, "Did it take?" And they sent one message back, "Yes." And I was like, excited that I had made it, you know, that I had successfully been veiled.<br>Okay, so then I was here for a while, and then after a while, I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I don't—I'm not myself. I am not doing this." So, once again, I began to muster my might to fight my way out. And as I did this, the most holy moment of my life happened where the great spirit of God came to me, or whatever word we want to use for it, the light, you know, the source came to me. And it showed me all of what I really am, the stars and the galaxies. And I felt the churning of our own sun in my being. I felt all the stars. I felt so much bliss and endless connectedness and love. And it said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this."<br>I'm sorry, I just—it's so precious to me and very personal. I've shared it a lot, even though it's so personal, because that's what we are. Not just this human character, we are the being who is knowing being human.<br>Okay, so that really calmed me, you know. I was like, "Oh, well, that's still what I am. That's wonderful. That's beautiful." So, I relaxed into the simple existence of being in the womb. And the next memory I have is of being born and the shock and the trauma of physical trauma being born, but no intellectual understanding at all, no context at all. I was just like, "What is this place?"<br><br><br>Okay, so that's a quick summary. And I want to get right into, since we're limited on time, and so I still want to leave some time for questions, you know, why we do this. I mean, and again, I can't put words on it all the way. It's far more than what anyone can say, and we all know deep down, but I'll just throw some ideas out there that I think can be very helpful.<br>Okay, so what we are is integrators of experience. So, we are consciousness itself, spirit, and we grow, we evolve, we expand as we are able to have defined experience and know it, like really know it, and make loving choices through it, loving versus fear-based choices. So, when we integrate experience, we are participating in what we call, what we can call, the expansion of being. That is the growth and the refinement of what we really are, which is spirit, by going through a relatively high-contrast situation. So, the contrast of Earth, which is very high, it's a very dense system, very high contrast, an experience of uniquely very separate separateness, you know, while we're human. <br>That is actually a powerful tool, and it is a precious opportunity, actually, to come and be human and have this very high-contrast experience because, when we can do that, and when we can integrate that experience, and when we can make loving choices rather than fear-based choices in this context, that is when we can meet this life with authenticity and caring and compassion and kindness and selflessness and fearlessness rather than all the tools of the ego, all the stories, all the fear, all the judgment, all the ways we try to reclaim our power with ego. <br>If we can really do that, even in very small moments, it is the most breathtaking and powerful good thing. I can't even put words on it. It's not about big human accomplishment, even. It's about acting in love and growing in love in even the smallest ways because the Earth is kind of like a play stage, and these are just all props. And the props are going to go away. The play will pass because it's not fundamentally real. It's real; we're having a real experience, but it's also an illusion in the sense that it's not fundamentally real. It's like having a very super real dream. It will pass; we will wake up. And when we do, we get to retain who we really are. We really have been in that experience. That stays with us, even though the context may be very different.<br>So, we come to personally know specific experiential vantage points and to express and experience our true loving nature within those contexts. And because Earth is super dense and highly constraining, it was a very high opportunity for growth, like ridiculously high opportunity for growth. So, to summarize all that, we are here to participate in the expansion of love and joy through personal evolution, which occurs through love-based rather than fear-based choice-making and through the integration of experience. That's at a very high level what we're doing. <br>And that can mean really different things for different people. You know, everyone has different challenges, different contexts. We're all very unique. You know, humans may all look kind of the same on the surface, but the souls of we're all very unique. We have a very unique path, and so it can mean different things for different people and on different journeys.<br>So, just four very quick metaphors for this, since this sounds kind of abstract. Number one: going. So, having a physical incarnation is like getting off the couch and going for a run. You know, you can stay on the couch all the time. It's nice and comfortable. You can watch TV, you can eat lots of good food, whatever. Why would you ever voluntarily leave the couch and go outside and put your body under stress and go for a run? Well, because it's an invigorating experience. You grow in strength, and you can experience new things. And then when you come back to the couch, it's comfortable even in a way that you didn't know before because you hadn't known anything other than the couch. You know what I mean?<br>Second, another exercise metaphor: it's like lifting weights on a weight bench. You know, why would you ever voluntarily lay down and push a heavy thing up? Like, why would you do that? Well, it's because it's a counter-pressure for you. And the contrast of Earth is a heck of a counter-pressure. All the circumstances, all the pains, all the biology, the limitations of biology, that's one heck of a counter-pressure.<br>A third metaphor: being human is like getting into a spacesuit and visiting an alien environment, a very constraining spacesuit so that you can go into this place that's not native to you. We're not natively separate. We have to come into this kind of experience if we want to know exactly what it's like to feel separate and to be separate. This is what we got to do.<br>And fourth, as I mentioned, it's like getting onto a roller coaster. Yeah, because once you get in and the bar lowers, you're in. While you're strapped in, you might not like it halfway through, but you're still in. And that is the very nature. You get the committed, and then you can't just easily exit if you'd like.<br><br><br>Okay, so the veil. So, why is it important? Why is it necessary? It permits us to have this specialized experience of creaturehood and to have this particular and unique cognitive environment because, if you remember all the rest of who you really are and what you really are, you wouldn't be able to just be. You wouldn't be getting up and going to work in the morning and going to the bathroom and eating your cereal, you know, paying your bills. If you knew that you were, say, the sun, if you could feel the sun churning in you like I felt, you wouldn't be able to do these things because you'd be that. You wouldn't be you. <br>So, if you want to be you—and as a human character, I mean, not the real you, they're not the true you, the human character—then you have to be able to focus deeply into it. And so, it limits our perception and our memory so that we can completely focus in it. And that is itself additive because, as we do that, it's like having a clean slate each time, even though we do carry certain things with us from experience to experience. We have this new personality now. Now we get to experience what it's like to be someone with just this background, just this human. And that is very helpful.<br>And lastly, the veil prevents homesickness because, if you remembered all of what we really are, it can be very painful. So, it's protective in that way because that side is so high vibration, so loving, so free, so full of joy that we almost need to not be consciously thinking about that all the time if we want to have this type of experience.<br><br><br>Okay, so why is love the way that in all this? This is going to sound abstract, but this is, I think, really important. Okay, our true nature is unity and connectedness. We are all ultimately one. We are all a part of one ocean. And so, love is when we're acting in alignment, being in alignment with the unity that is true to who we are, whereas ego and fear arise from the illusion of separation. <br>Separation is not a fundamental state. It's not; it's an alien state. But we're afraid of it, and fear is what happens, what we experience when we have yet to evolve through this type of constraint. It's not even that the constraint is bad. When I say low vibration, I don't mean bad. I just mean highly constraining. We actually get to apply the meaning to our lives while we're here. But meanwhile, love is what we really are. It's the true power. Love is the only true power. Fear has no ultimate power. It only might have very temporary, short-term apparent power in the physical in some way. But the true power is love and freedom and joy and immortality and all the creativeness of our spirit. That is the true power. Fear is not powerful.<br>So, when we choose love, we are aligning ourselves even here, even in this very distant point. You know, we've gone so far vibrationally, we can actualize that love here and be that love here. There's this beautiful expansion of being that takes place, and we grow when that happens. Love is our ever-present true nature. That's what we are. And we are so loved that we are permitted to choose the experience of separation and to choose to experience not love for a while while we are here so that we may better know it forever.<br>So, why choose love? That is what we are. It's what the true power is. It's the immortal, joyful freedom of what really is. And it is the joy of our nature. So, it's what we're here to do.<br><br><br>Okay, so before I stop talking, a few minutes for questions. Three quick reminders. Number one: you're not human. You're you. You're the beautiful you that is having the experience of being human today. And there's a big difference there. You might think you associate deeply with human content, but who you really are is the you that feels like you to you. Your consciousness itself is who you are, not human. Human is just something you're knowing or being for a while or wearing. It's a temporary experience.<br>Okay, number two: you are loved. This is the most important message anyone can say to you, to remind you. You are deeply, deeply, personally loved, like loved so much that the universe is birthing love for you specifically. It's just—and I know that we feel so veiled to that while we're here, but I just hope that you can feel deep down in yourself somewhere that love because that is true. You really are loved. You really are that precious and powerful and important.<br>And three: there is nothing to fear ultimately. All of this experience is taking place within that larger context of love. So, we don't need to take the great challenges of our lives here so seriously. We don't actually need to be afraid. And I know that's not easy. I came to face fear. I felt a lot of fear. I was deeply traumatized in my 20s. I did a lot of healing, and I know, and I've been in pain, chronic pain. I know it's not easy, but ultimately, in the larger context of what is even more real than this, there's nothing to fear ever.<br>So, I'll stop so that we have a few minutes for questions because we have a pretty short time.<br>All right, well, thanks, Christian. We do have some questions. So, the first one is: another person has knowledge that she's a spirit having a human experience, but she still struggles with this even at age 57. Do you have any tips for her? And do we have a purpose? There's two questions. I'll start with the second one: yes, we absolutely do have a purpose. This entire play that we're engaged in is very meaningful indeed. It's not just some nihilistic thing that's happening in a corner of the creation. It's a very purposeful and beautiful creation.<br>As for how to find it, that's a very like—to find one's true nature again, that's a super personal question. I also get lost again in the veiling and in the stories of the human character quite easily. But personally, I have found meditation to be very helpful. I mean, the answer to the question is very unique and personal, but I'm just throwing out meditation as one mention because, as we gain experiential familiarity with what we really are, which is awareness itself versus what we are not, which is our thoughts, that larger nature can rise up on its own because we've created space, not so deeply associated with the story now. <br>And while we're not so deeply associated with it, and there's that space, that peace and that love can rise up. And when that happens, it's beautiful, and we remember that's what we really always were.<br>Okay, how does the experience of grief on Earth factor into our growth? What is the purpose of grief?<br>Okay, so love is our true nature, right? So, when we love someone deeply, and then they are absent from us, we experience grief because now we are experiencing what is perceived as the loss of that person, the loss of their presence. In fact, they cannot be lost. There's no such thing as separation. Those we love absolutely still exist, and we're connected to them right now. In fact, even just a loving thought is enough to bring them back to us in consciousness space, though we may not perceive it while we're human.<br>Grief, then, like so many aspects of contrast that we can experience on Earth, is an opportunity to experience some end. Yes, if we love and we have that connectedness in that relationship, what's it like to experience when we don't have that, when that seems to be missing? And if we can fully feel and know and process and heal that here, even to some small degree, that is actually an empowering thing because, then, when this is released, and we're back on the other side, and we see there's never a true loss, we cannot be separated. But now we know it better forever. We know more forever how precious it is to have those loving relationships.<br>I mean, I'm generalizing when I make that comment because grief is different for every person, and it's, of course, specific to the relationship that is lost. But, in general, it is an opportunity to experience that contrast so that we better understand the true loving connection that we have forever. Absolutely.<br>Okay, two more questions. Upon leaving this Earth plane, are we able to remember our true essence immediately and also all of our previous lifetimes on Earth and elsewhere?<br>Okay, so I can't speak to that categorically because each individual is unique. But, in general, I'll say that eventually, everyone will know who we really are because that is who we really are. And eventually, a given personality's journey must come back to the higher self. The higher self just means the you that's not obfuscated anymore. You are still you. You're always you. You're always your higher self. But to come back to full awareness of that, we always do reach that point eventually. <br>For some individuals, I think that's quite soon after physical passing. For others, I know that many individuals benefit from experiencing a very Earth-like experience for a while in a transitionary reality system, even until they're ready to take on the next step. But that's very personal, and it depends on the nature of the individual.<br>Okay, did you meet with your soul group or choose your parents to help you decide to be born in this life?<br>So, in my memory, I did not meet with an entire group, but I did choose my parents. I'm aware of my soul group to some extent intuitively, but I don't have active conscious memory of engaging with them. The parents were very important. I remember reviewing the qualities of them. I even had a sense of when they were meeting. And I knew they would be really good parents and that they would help me in really meaningful ways. So, yeah, I absolutely reviewed the parents. I knew both of them well before I was even in my mom's womb.<br>Okay, great. There's one more question that came in. When you were in that pre-birth state, was it a blissful, heavenly area similar to what many NDEs describe?<br>Yes, yeah. So, the state I was in before reviewing my next life path was what I would describe as a realm of golden light where I was perfectly free. And it's really hard to describe these things because we like to think in terms of earthly activities. There were activities that we could call creative in nature, and there's all sorts—we can't put one word on it.<br>There's like consciousness activities, love activities, learning, but in a completely different context. But anyway, it was a blissful state of all connectedness and knowing and freedom, just total freedom, like unbelievable amounts of freedom where you can just—I use the word "frolic" before when I shared this experience, like frolicking. It's the closest English word I can think of to just moving happily through wherever you want, you know, just rejoicing who you are. I remember being in a state like that before agreeing to, you know, to come and have this adventure.<br>Well, unfortunately, we're out of time. There are more questions coming in, so would you mind if I put your website link into the chat box so people can get in contact with you if they'd like?<br>Yeah, of course.<br>Okay, I'll do that. Well, we're out of time. Thank you, Christian. It was wonderful, and thank you for spending your time with us today at the conference.<br>Thank you. I appreciate very much the opportunity. Thank everybody here for being human today.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2022/christian-sundberg-full-2022.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2022/Christian Sundberg Full 2022.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:04:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Life changing Q and A with Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=5A3NTX90hCM<br>30 OCT 2022<br>See, fear and rejection is a closing-off action, whereas we are not actually separated from each other. So, when we're here in this experience of separation, we close off even more because I'm afraid. Oh my gosh, I need to close off. But love is open. It is totally open. It's totally accepting. It's so accepting that it even allows us to choose to come into an experience of separation for the opportunities. Like, it's not going to say no. Love accepts. It allows. It's totally accepting. So, surrender is an intention that is in alignment with that type of acceptance to life.<br><br><br>Hi, welcome to NDE Talk. I'm your host, Natalie Higgins. Today's guest is Christian Sundberg, who joins us today for a Q&amp;A session. It is a little different from the rest of the videos that I've posted previously. However, we thought it would be more important to shed light on topics such as why are we here, what is your purpose, and how can we help expand your consciousness. I will link in the description to his website that is full of many videos on his pre-birth memories and his book, A Walk in the Physical. So, please pause this video if you haven't heard of him before, watch some of the videos, read a bit of his book, and get to understand him as a person. Then, jump back onto the podcast and get ready for an amazing Q&amp;A that is sure to awaken many, many more people and expand your consciousness. So, without further ado, I welcome you, Christian Sundberg.<br>So, Christian, for the viewers watching, could you give them a little bit of background on who you are, where you came from, and how you are the you that you are today?<br>Thank you, Natalie, for having me on the show. It's such a funny question because we are not actually the human story. So, you know, when we ask someone, "How did you get here? Who are you?" we're asking, "What forms did you experience in this life leading up to this moment?" But, on the surface, you know, I'm a 42-year-old male living in the USA, and I have a beautiful family, and I work a full-time regular job and all that. But 12 years ago, I had an awakening experience in which, over the course of several months, I began meditating and began to have non-physical experiences. I had some out-of-body experiences, and I also had pre-birth memories return to me.<br>I've shared my pre-birth memory story a number of other times, but basically, I remember choosing this life and why, and I remember the process of incarnating into this experience as Christian, as this human, and why I came—the purpose of my coming. And it's been an amazing journey. Then, I started sharing that story only a few years ago, about four years ago now. Maybe I didn't share it for the first eight years or so because, you know, I'm like a working professional. It's kind of a thing you don't talk about. But I felt very compelled to share, and I did. I also worked over six years to write a book that I published last year, called A Walk in the Physical.<br>Congratulations. <br><br><br>Thank you. And I really felt spirit-led to write this book. I know I feel even that I didn't actually even fully write it. I just made it available. And it's done very well. It is available for free. It's not about money. It's not about selling the book. But I came to this moment here now in life where I just need to share. Like, I can't not share. After sharing my story and publishing the book, I've met so many amazing people around the world. There are so many people out there who are aware that we are not just this. We are not just this human journey. There is an incredible opportunity to help remind each other and to empower each other. You know, because when we know who we truly are, even in a little bit, we're just so empowered. Our true nature is so powerful and beyond all the limitations and fears of Earth. We are beings of incredible love and freedom and joy and creativity. That is what we are. Every day, we've just become deeply immersed in this human experience for a while.<br>Yeah, beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing that with us, Christian. So, for you guys who are watching today, I'm going to be doing something a little bit different, and that is a question-and-answer series with Christian in regards to his pre-birth memory. However, we're not going to go over his experience. So, if you do want to know a little bit more about this, please pause the video now, jump onto his website, which I will link below, check out some of the videos that he has, and you will be informed on his experience. Then, pop back over to the question-and-answer session, and let's see what we have for you today. So, thank you for sharing that with us, Christian, and I will start with my first question.<br>Okay, can we start by going right to the beginning and that is to ask, who are we really? And also, can we talk a little bit about consciousness as well?<br><br><br>Yeah, those two questions are very much related because who we really are is beyond description. But the closest word—so, okay, before I say any of this, I just have to disclaim that language is incredibly limiting. There are just no words we can use to possibly describe our higher natures or who we really are, the larger spiritual context, the nature of God. These things cannot be articulated because words are formed. They are symbols, and symbols are a part of the Earth play. They're part of our local context, and our symbols are based in assumptions of Earth that don't actually apply to our true nature—assumptions like discrete location, being separate, and linear time. So, I just have to say that up front because we really cannot possibly put words on it. But if we have to just put a word on what we really are, the simplest word would be consciousness or life itself with a capital L or spirit, which are synonymous.<br>So, the you that's listening today, you're you. You're the you that feels like you to you. You know, you're the most you you think that that you means the forms of life, perhaps the body and the story and the job and the kids and the health challenges and all the rest. No, actually, you are the consciousness experiencing those things. You are you engaged in that context of form. And that is a huge distinction because when we're not engaged in this context of form, the totality of what we are is so vast, so deep, and so beautiful. It's just that it's just so beyond language what we are. You could say that we are the substance of the stars—not just physically, but that which gave rise to the stars. You know, we're the substance of love and joy itself, like alive and capable of so much more than we see even here in the physical.<br>So, it's very difficult to articulate what we are, but we are multi-dimensional beings having a physical experience. That's what we are, in short.<br>Very well said, very, very well said, Christian. Okay, moving on to the next question. Now that we understand what we are and who we are, my next question would be—and it's a two-part question—why are we here? And also, could you explain a bit on how we chose to come here? So, not why we chose to come here, but how we chose to come here.<br><br><br>Yeah, okay. So, the human experience offers the opportunity for a very unique, well-defined context through which we can make choices. And through making choices, which is wielding intent—there's actually intent prior to choice. Choice-making happens within a context. Intent is the movement of consciousness in a context. We're here to wield intent, make choices in the context, and then grow through the integration of those experiences and from the results of our choice-making. So, you could say we're here to evolve the quality of our intention towards love and away from fear, to overcome fear, and to integrate experience. Those are the two most simple ways I think to put what the purpose of the physical incarnation is: to be able to make choices and see the results of those choices and learn about ourselves and to actualize our true natures in the context. And it's also to come to terms with these experiences and integrate them into what we are. We're like experience integrators, and that's like this is what we are. We go, we have experiences, and we integrate them into what we are, and we learn, and we grow. And as we do that, the learning, by the way, is not intellectual learning. It's a learning of the being by being.<br>And as we do that, we expand what we are, and we also help expand all that is because we're a part of all that is. So, when we, as a drop in the ocean, expand, the whole ocean actually expands. So, we're performing a service, you could say, by being on the cutting edge of physicality, and we dive into this very, very, very dense context of the physical to participate in that process. So, this is a very, very alien state, actually, by comparison to what we actually are because here we experience a very high degree of separation that is not native to who we really are. And that level of separation and the level of the constraints that we're wearing is very high and potentially very difficult.<br>And so, because the constraints are so high, the opportunity is so high. So, that's a short comment as to why we're here. So, how do we choose? So, I mean, we're all very, very unique beings. You could say we're each like a universe unto ourselves of rich history and qualities and capacity. Oh, it's so beautiful. We're all so unique. So, we each have our own reasons, our own purposes. But, in general, we come to participate in expansion, as I just mentioned, to grow in love and to overcome fear, which is also synonymous with participating in expansion, or to express love and actualize love in some way, perhaps even for someone else.<br>And the how is that we do that is to—okay, so in order to become human, we have to accept the constraints that go along with being physical. And the constraints—what I mean is the constraints that are worn by consciousness, by you. So, your consciousness, your spirit, adopts, takes on—it's like wearing a heavy cloak or something, like putting on a heavy cloak or maybe putting on a spacesuit of the body. But it's not that the body is fundamentally real. The body is just a part of this rich context, and we adopt constraints in order to engage this context. And we call those constraints, in part, the veil.<br>The veil is just a term we use for the fact that we don't remember while we're here—except for you, Christian. You have the exception. No, no, no. I only have a tiny little—no, no, we are very much veiled. And the veiling is like an obscuring of our true nature. So, we no longer remember the fullness of who we are, and we no longer have conscious day-to-day access, most of the time, to like all the other reality systems in which we're engaged, all the other portions of our self, of which there are many portions. You know, we tend to be totally focused on the human experience, but that's what the veil does. It enables an almost complete immersion into the matrix, if you could say, into the simulation of the physical.<br>Awesome. Yeah, Christian, do you believe in the Bible or religion, or is it simply a part of this reality which we are now? Because it seems to me that saying that there's a heaven and hell is like putting restraints on the other side. You know, yeah, and that can't be all that there is.<br><br><br>So, first of all, to your question about the Bible, I'm very sensitive to trying to speak to the religion of others because religion is very personal and very meaningful for very many people. And it's not simply a matter of categorically accepting or denying it. I will say that religion, however, is another set of human forms—that is, ideas, objects, rituals, dogmas—and through those forms, many people can potentially successfully pursue the divine, their relationship with the divine. Yeah, others may not. It has to do with how we use the form. You know, whether it be a hammer or a religion, we choose how we use our form. It's the quality of our intent behind it that is what matters.<br>So, do we do it in a loving way? Do we do it for the purposes of pursuing the divine and actually growing towards love? Or are we doing it for ego, which is fear? Yeah, you know, how are we using it? So, I'm not going to categorically throw one belief system in one direction or the other, but I will say that human belief, in general, can't possibly articulate the fullness of the truth of our higher natures. It's just not the nature of form. No words can do that. No set of beliefs can do that because we transcend form entirely. We transcend all of duality. So, how can something within duality be the full truth? It's just not how it works.<br>Okay, so as for heaven and hell, there are many, many reality systems, and I'm not qualified to speak to them. I've had experiences in higher systems and astral systems and different systems of reality that I'm careful to put language on. We have vastly oversimplified the richness and complexity of the other side. We tend to think there's Earth, and then there's the afterlife. Yeah, if there is an afterlife, you know, we know there's Earth, but if there's an afterlife, it must be this one other. No, Earth is like just one of many, many possible experiences you can have. Maybe just a couple crude metaphors, like tuning into a certain radio frequency on your radio or maybe logging into a certain video game on Steam. It's like a video game service. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You might have a hundred games in your library. You log into one.<br>You know, I'm just using crude metaphors. I'm just saying that the context beyond Earth is incredibly vast and rich, even just in our universe. Our universe is huge, and Earth is just one tiny little portion—tiny, tiny little portion. We're talking hundreds and hundreds of billions of stars and hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars. And Earth is one tiny little—and that whole thing is one tiny little piece of a much, much, much bigger whole. So, it's not so simple as to frame it as a heaven and a hell. There are very, very beautiful heavenly realms. There are experiences in non-physical systems that are thought-responsive that can be quite hellish, depending on our own nature and our own fear. So, it's okay that we have some crude metaphors, but it's much bigger than those metaphors.<br><br><br>So, Christian, let's talk about homesickness. And I don't want to bring you back to that place, yeah, but do you ever feel overbearingly homesick? Do you ever want to go back?<br>Oh my goodness, yes. No, absolutely. Homesickness is something I deal with very much every day. It's very tangible. I think we all actually feel it to some degree or another, whether it's more or less conscious. We all kind of yearn for a place we've forgotten. In my case, I very much feel it. I feel like that's one of the benefits of the veil, actually, is that it permits us to not be debilitated by homesickness because we're able to focus entirely here and not even remember the incredible beauties and freedom of the higher realms. So, I definitely deal with that every day, but I also am aware of the incredible opportunity of allowing and integrating the distance between there and here. So, now that we're physical, even my homesickness is something that is an element of contrast that I can use to allow so that I don't need to resist even being in this state of great limitation of being human. I don't need to. When I'm able to do that fully, there is that peace and that joy of who we really are can be even here, and then there's no homesickness, of course, because we are what we are. We always are what we are. But yeah, I definitely experience that, and I've heard that from many other people who have reached out. I've met so many people that experience poignant homesickness. I totally get it.<br>Yeah, that's not strange. I mean, we—for instance, I asked that because I also have a longing to feel what near-death experiences talk about—that all-loving, all-encompassing light, just the feeling of being held. It's like I want that. I want that.<br>Okay, so since you've been able to remember all-knowing, the all-expansive love and infinite source, to then a very low vibrational state, at some point, you would have had to just surrender. So, could you talk a bit about the importance of surrendering and letting go of what does not serve us here? You know, whether it be a bad relationship or that decision we should have made or whatever situation it may be, how can we learn to let go?<br><br><br>That's a great question. So, Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer, in his work, he has a model in which he talks about what he describes as three primary paths of spiritual growth. One of them is the path of knowledge, which is really getting in there and integrating things the old, messy, hard way. One of them is the path of service, which is focusing the quality of your intent on serving others. And the last is the path of surrender. I'm mentioning that because that model has really helped me. I didn't appreciate the importance of surrender early in my awakening.<br>Okay, so one of the main things we're here to do is to face fear. And the reason that facing fear is a primary element of what we're doing here is fear is—okay, so if we process fear, that is synonymous with the expansion of love because love is our true nature. Love is what we really, really always are—love and joy. But when we resist the physical and we resist the circumstance and the stories we've put on it because we're putting the stories on it, when we resist all that, we experience fear because the resistance and the fear are connected. Fear just means yet unevolved in this. It's just some aspect of reality we haven't fully come to terms with, either reality or some aspect of the perception and story that we've put on it. Like, "I feel powerless. I don't like that. I'm not okay with that. I reject that." And then the ego rises up, of course, to try to fix the problem. "Oh, you're not powerless because look, you've got money. Or you're not powerless because look, you can control this person next to you," whatever.<br>Okay, all that is connected to this important idea of surrender because surrender is moving your intention in the direction of saying, "I will not reject. I do not reject. I will allow everything—all that is, all circumstance, all story, all feeling, all the feeling that I didn't want to feel." And when we do that, it comes up because now you're not rejecting anymore, so you're going to feel it. But that's okay. That's wonderful. It's wonderful because that is processing fear. You see, because then you're no longer rejecting. You're allowing the feeling. You're allowing yourself to know the fullness of whatever it is that you've been pushing away. And when you do that, you open to reality and to all that is.<br>See, fear and rejection is a closing-off action, whereas we are not actually separated from each other. So, when we're here in this experience of separation, we close off even more because I'm afraid. Oh my gosh, I need to close off. But love is open. It is totally open. It's totally accepting. It's so accepting that it even allows us to choose to come into an experience of separation for the opportunities. Like, it's not going to say no. Love accepts. It allows. It's totally accepting. So, surrender is an intention that is in alignment with that type of acceptance to life. We don't reject life. We surrender to it. We allow it. And when we do that, life opens up to us in return because now we can feel again fully. Now, all of a sudden, everything around us may be very intense, especially for those of us who are more sensitive, but it's also full of so much potential, so much beauty, so much opportunity. That is a part of the expansion that we're here to do.<br>I felt that on so many levels. Thank you so much for sharing that. Absolutely incredible. Okay, so I'm going to shift gears here. All right, let's talk about belief systems and programming. So, we've grown up in a world that has programmed us to be a certain way—oh yes, to worry about what we look like, are we enough, did I earn enough in order to be a better person to society. How can we break away from these belief systems?<br><br><br>That question is very personal because each one of us is unique, and our path of meeting the physical will be very unique, very personal. And overcoming conditioning—and not even overcoming, becoming aware of conditioning and growing past it—can be a very personal process for each person. Okay, so it is definitely true that we are conditioned here on Earth. Form is handed to us, and we're told to identify with this form. I'm just speaking generally. The form could be some story. You know, "You got to get good grades because look, if you get good grades now, you've got value." You know, that was something I used to—I mean, in my early days, I believed. I didn't even recognize that I believed that, but I worked really hard to do well in school because now I must have value. I didn't realize I had a sense of lack of self-worth, so I tried to prove to myself that I had worth by doing the things my parents told me I should do. Yeah, you know, we all do. We do that, especially because when you're a young child, your parents are like gods. You know, your environment, and you take on what they hand you and what they teach you very deeply.<br>So, one comment I'll make, though, about how we can become aware of that to grow past it is a specific suggestion, and that is meditation, actually, because through meditation, we gain greater familiarity with what we really are, which is awareness itself—not the thoughts, not the stories. As we do that, there's this beautiful space that's created, not because we're trying to create a space, but just because we're growing an awareness of the truth of who we really are. And then we can see the stories more for what they are. As we also grow in the ability to feel what we really are, like the depth of consciousness itself is profoundly full of joy and worthiness and love and freedom. And I mentioned those words in this context because on Earth, many people's conditioning is that they're conditioned to believe they're not worthy unless they're not, they're not lovable unless they're not free. You know, all these negative self-perceptions that we buy into that are not in alignment with the truth of our spirit.<br>So, that's why we suffer, you know, because now we're buying into these stories that are not like, "Oh, I'm not free. I have to go to work every day. I got to pay the bills. I don't have money. I'm not free." And then that perception of not freedom takes you vibrationally even further away from the truth of who you really are because you're entertaining a perception of not being free. Now, that's okay. We're here to learn through that, to grow. Where else can you experience not being free? Here. This is where you do it. But our true nature is free. It's very free. So, as we meditate and as we gain in mindfulness, that awareness of who we really are grows in tangibility, and we simultaneously begin to be able to identify, "Oh, that conditioning—that's just a thought that I've had 27,000 times. I have it every day. I just have this thought. It keeps coming up: 'You're not worthy,' or a feeling, or 'I'm feeling attached to a thought.'" Whatever thought objects, feeling objects come up, and we're like, "Oh, I'm the experiencer of that."<br>Now, that step is a huge step because one of the main things we're doing on Earth is associating with form, for better or for worse. And so, the association with form hurts if the form is negative. And so, being able to take a step back and experientially find, "I'm not the form. I'm not the story. I am me. I'm the experiencer. I'm the knower of the story," that is liberating. It's profoundly liberating.<br>Yeah. Okay, and I wanted to talk a little bit while we're still there about meditation as well because some of the people watching may not have meditated before, or they simply can't meditate. They can't close up the monkey brain. What are some tips you could give us in order to help better quiet the mind?<br><br><br>Yeah, so when I first started meditating, I did it because I was listening to Tom Campbell's lectures and started reading his thousand-page tome, and he recommended meditation as a form of investigation—just go see what you are. I very much wholeheartedly agree with that. I recommend that now. Use meditation as a form of objective, 100% objective investigation. Just go look at your awareness itself when not engaged in thought. Just go look at what it is. But anyway, when I started, the monkey mind—oh my goodness. You know, I remember sitting down for 10 minutes, trying to focus on one neutral object in my mind. I realized, "A, this is very hard," yeah, for even 10 minutes. I actually had a little bit of just a tiny sense of peace, just a little bit, and I was like, "Oh, that's really nice."<br>So, Tom Campbell recommended to continue doing so without judgment, and I think that's very important because you can't see the bountiful rewards of meditation after 10 minutes or an hour or several hours or weeks of meditation. It's not how it works. You practice the use of your intention to focus on something neutral to start so that you regain the ability to choose your focus. Otherwise, you're lost in the stream of thoughts all day. All day becomes an unconscious stream of thoughts. It's like each thought is like a dream: "I have to eat lunch now. I have to pay the bills. I have to go pick up my child." You know, thought, thought. When you're thinking the thought, you are—forgive the language—just the being who's thinking the thought. That's the nature of a thought.<br>But as you meditate and practice focusing on something neutral, eventually, you can drop the object of focus and just be fully alert and fully present in this moment. And as you do that, you discover—I can't describe this because it's not a thought. It's not a new thought. You experientially discover you become the observer of yourself. Yes, you become the observer of the mind-body complex form that's going on now. That's not an act of separation because I think to the human, we might think, "Oh, that means I have to sit there, and my goal is to become the observer." No, actually, this is a very much unifying, fully present experience in which first you gain the ability to focus on something neutral for you, and then you put in the time—weeks, months. It's okay. Don't judge yourself for the progress. You just do it every day, 40 minutes a day, something like that. And you just put in that time, and then eventually, once you gain the ability to focus on something neutral without a stream of thoughts bullying you over, you can let go of the object and just look squarely at your awareness itself—your life itself, the living aliveness it feels like in your body, but actually, your body is occurring in it, in the aliveness. Yeah, so you just dwell in the aliveness.<br>And at first, when you first start this process, it may feel like you're going towards nothing, but in fact, that aliveness is full, not empty. That's the best way I can put it. I don't know if I spoke to your original question. I went kind of on a tangent there. I recommend setting aside time every day. I recommend a simple meditation exercise in my book that works for me. I highly recommend meditating. There's a phrase—I don't know where this originated; I think it's some kind of Asian phrase that I love. It's just this cute phrase: "Meditate for an hour a day unless you don't have time, and then meditate for two hours." Yeah, I love that. That's me. It's so true, though, because you think the story that's going on in your life right now is very important. It's okay. It's actually not as important as you think. You can put down the story and dwell fully in the present moment and in life itself. And that is very rejuvenating and freeing. The body heals, actually. There's just this energizing effect, not because you're trying, but just because as you gain—as you are no longer associated with all these dense, clunky, painful forms, and you're allowing a space for that aliveness, life rises up because life is what you are.<br>Beautiful. Thank you so much. So, I wanted to talk about another topic that is pretty huge at the moment. There's a huge energy shift that is currently happening here on Earth. Now, as we are going through transition and awakening of the collective consciousness from old belief systems, patterns, and into unknown territory—since all we know is now irrelevant—so this new awakening, things are getting a little bit rattled. And so, we've got some insights that you can share in order for us to keep our light during these times and during this huge energy shift. How can we stop ourselves from being overwhelmed?<br><br><br>Excellent. That's a fantastic question. So, there is an awakening going on on Earth. I remember being aware of it in my pre-birth experience. It was very normal. It was known. It wasn't—you know, it was just like, "That's the act of the play that we're in," kind of thing. There has been a significant shift in the energy of the human collective consciousness in the last 25 years, especially. It's very fast compared to the scope of what we're doing. It's quick per unit time. And as that happens, like you said, there is an incredible amount of thought momentum in the collective consciousness that is going to need to be processed. Yeah, and we have a lot of fear-based thought patterns that are deep in the human collective consciousness. We have a huge amount of "us versus them" ingrained into our collective consciousness—"us versus them" meaning all forms of it. You know, my tribe versus your tribe, my team versus your team, my nation versus your nation, my skin color versus your skin color. Yeah, that's just an example. It's just an example. There are many elements of this. That's just one that is a good example because right now, the vibration is getting to the point where we're not aligning with that so much now.<br>And so, all those old patterns of racism and sexism and, you know, sexual rights, you know, all the group judgments, they're coming up and being re-experienced and processed in a way that may seem very tumultuous. So, the play may seem tumultuous on the surface. This is the important thing because we're moving the objects around, and because we're dealing with a lot of—we're taking all these patterns in our collective consciousness and we're reevaluating them, and we're trying to really evolve as individuals, which means as a society. So, there's a lot of tumultuousness on the surface, but please, I would just say, don't—the surface level is not the true level. It's not the ultimate level. It's just the epidermis, you know, of what's going on. If you look deeper, away from the drama of the stage of the play, you may find that actually love is growing.<br><br><br>And so, I think a lot of people can take tangible, practical steps in their lives to move in that direction. One of them is—I'm not saying don't be informed, but I would watch less mainstream news. Just one recommendation. I don't watch mainstream news in general. I mean, I do go out, and I wish to be informed and know what's going on. Yeah, I'm the same. But there's a quality of messaging which is really important. Think about this: We are all powerful, creative beings. We're like little creation engines. Every one of us is like a little creation engine, and millions of people are tuning into the news. And the news—so one person made a fear-based decision and murdered somebody else, and then they put that on the news, and now two million people hear about the murder and think upon murder. So, it's—I'm not saying it's unimportant that that action happened, and we should do our best for that person if we have the opportunity. I'm not saying that. But there is a certain irresponsibility when two million people spend 10 minutes of their day focusing on murder because I'm just saying that our focus is powerful. We'll put it that way. And our focus is important. What we're focusing on is important. And we are—I say little, but we're actually not little. We're like galaxies, each one of us, who have come collectively to create this world.<br>And so, we tend to get lost in the focus of all the negative. That's what I'm saying. That gets put back up into our face over and over and over again. We could put that down. For every robbery, there are thousands of safe days. Yeah, for every person who is harmed, there are thousands of people helping other people that we don't publicize in the same way. You know, fear is stimulating. It sells. It's an itch, so we put it on TV, and now we sell commercials. Screw that. Yeah, right. They are powerful, loving beings. So, one of the things we can do then is choose where we focus, and then also we can identify what messaging are we putting on the tumultuous surface because we have power in the messaging that we label it. That's important. Okay, and one other comment—this is super, super important.<br>We tend to feel powerless because we think, "Oh, I can't go out and change the whole world. You know, I only have one vote. Whatever. You know, like, we don't think we have much power." Okay, here's the thing, though. This is super important. The physical is not primary. What's primary is consciousness. Consciousness is first, and the physical arises from it and through it. And so, the reason I say that is you are an important part of the consciousness of humanity, the collective consciousness. If you matter, imagine like a pond. You are a drop in the pond. And so, what happens in your consciousness is important and powerful. If you face your own fear, you are changing the light of your drop in the pond, and the whole pond can see it, actually. So, people may not be able to physically see it, but the thing is, your being is much deeper than your physical eyes. We are all connected energetically, or communicating energetically, all the time. I'll just give one quick example because that may sound like, "What do you mean?"<br>I participated in a mediumship circle one day where I was just in a state that was an altered state. One of the members of our meditation group said something about China, and I saw and heard and felt her thought reach around and touch China—like the body of what China was in the collective consciousness. Wow. And I was like, "Holy crap, her thought is a thing." Like, it really is. Like, I saw it. I heard it. I felt it. I was aware of how that energy nudged the whole of China—all of China got nudged a little tiny bit. So, I'm just saying that because it's like we think this is like—we can't see it, so it must not be real. No, it's real. It's just that it's at a level of being that is not commonly perceivable in the physical. So, I'm saying that because your thoughts are powerful. Your processing of your fear is powerful. If you move towards more joy and fun in your life, you are helping the collective heal. Like, it may not be obvious, but if you can—you don't even have to be around anybody. Just go smell the flower and appreciate it. Go pet the dog. Love the dog. Whatever. Be open to life in that moment. When you're open to life in that moment, that light shines down through your drop energetically. There's a pitch change. It's like the water changes temperature. Yeah, and when your drop changes temperature, the whole pond changes a little bit. And the higher vibration we are, the more empowered we are to face and process all that old crappy garbage stuff that seems to be so prevalent.<br>It just gave me a thought. Like, if there's something that I'm scared of, I'm gonna be like, "I'm gonna go jump in there right now, and I'm just gonna handle it face first. Just get in there. This is gonna be great. I'm changing humanity." You are. And I'm saying that because like we all feel like so many people feel so powerless. Like, "Oh, I'm just one little person in this big old world. I can't change it." You can change the world. You just—and when I say like you just change yourself, that may feel like, "Oh, that's so small." No, you are a part of the world. You are important. You really are important. But here we are in a world where billions of people have forgotten how important and how powerful they are, and we run around sloppily focused on consumerism and, you know, like, "Oh, I'm gonna wear nicer clothes than you," and, you know, physical positioning, whatever. That's all like whatever. That's a big distraction. The truth of the love of who we are is more powerful and more real than the superficiality that we've normalized. We just have to take our own personal step back in that direction in our own day, in time, like actually.<br>Yeah, yeah, absolutely. A message of hope. Yeah, definitely. <br>Another question I have—it may not be approved by some, but it's something that's been brought to my awareness—that is, we are eternal, limitless beings. Are we particles of God's source energy? And if so, could it be that we are God's source experiencing all potentials of possibility of creation?<br><br><br>Yeah, so like I said, language is ridiculously limiting, but to be crude about it, yes. Yeah, we are pieces of source. I love the Rumi quote. I put this in my book like three times because this quote is so powerful and full: "You are not just a drop in the ocean. You are the mighty ocean in the drop." Amen. It's not—and that's not a matter of arrogance or something. It's just what you are. Yeah, so yes, from your perspective, source is seeing and knowing itself and all of reality. All that is becomes more through you. It's beautiful. Yeah, really. It's a beautiful thing.<br>Yeah. A chapter in your book that jumped out at me—page 95: "I am, therefore I think." Such an incredible insight. This is sort of likened to the law of attraction. Now, I'm all about the law of attraction, but you say it's back to front. So, the law of attraction teaches you think, and then you put the thought into action, and then you know it comes to you, whereas you say, "I am, therefore I think." Could you elaborate on that?<br><br><br>Sure, yeah. The statement I made is just one more layer back. So, being—this is first. So, you are. You exist. You're conscious. That's first. Yeah, that beingness is full. We could say, from a materialistic standpoint, it's empty. I don't like the word "empty" ever in the context of spirit because it's not empty. It just transcends the form that is within it. Yeah, so transcendent beingness engages form, whether that be the form of a physical or thought objects.<br>Okay, so I know that when the law of attraction is discussed, we tend to focus on the idea of thoughts as things, and they are things. But there's something that precedes a thought, and that is an intention. And what I mean is consciousness has to move in some way. It's the best way I don't know what words to put on it, but beingness has to move in a direction, do something. Let there be layers of intention that lead to form, and then that can issue more intention, which is a huge cycle. It's a huge churning of creation. There are layers and layers and layers of form. So, the physical is not like there's the physical and then there's like one other layer, and that's it. There are many layers of creation.<br>Okay, so I'm saying that because beingness exists, then it wields an intention, and the intention in our reality might yield a thought. So, let's say that you really want—I'm just being a little bit facetious, but I've heard this said—let's say you really want a new car. So, you think about wanting a new car. Okay, well, it's true that thinking about wanting a new car is creating a thought form about a new car. But what the universe is listening to is not the object of the car. It's listening to your intent. Ah, interesting. So, your intent may be, "I'm afraid I won't be able to get to work. Mm-hmm. Please give me a new car. Oh my gosh, I'm afraid. Please give me a new car. Oh my gosh, I'm afraid. Please give me a new car." That's what the universe hears. Like, there's not a trick. You can't trick reality. Like, reality—your intention is your intention, whatever it really is. Like, whatever it really is, whoever you really are, that's who you are. You can't—your ego may spin all sorts of stories. "Oh, no, I want a new car because I'm abundant," whatever reason. Yeah, but the quality of your intention is what the universe hears.<br>Now, we are abundant, life-filled beings. That is our true nature. It is absolutely wonderful that we live abundant lives full of health and physical abundance and all of that. I'm not saying that. I'm just pointing out, though, that it's not just the mechanism of a surface thought. It's who we are that's pushing reality. Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Labs (PEAR Labs) at Princeton did a number of years of experimentation on psi phenomena—that is, consciousness affecting the physical world—for 25 or 30 years. I forget how many, but one of the findings I remember hearing about in their research was that people did affect outcome, but roughly half the people affected in the direction they intended, and roughly half the people affected it in the opposite direction that they intended. But it was measurable. I'm generalizing. I don't know the exact details, but Tom Campbell was talking about that, and he was basically saying because the people who pushed it the opposite direction, their intention was, "I'm afraid I won't succeed." Yeah, yeah. So, they pushed towards that direction of not what they were consciously—do you see what I'm saying? And this is one of the reasons why processing fear is first. Yeah, it's not just about getting the things. It's about who we are.<br>If you process your own fear, you're much more able to be in a state of clarity from which you can manifest. I'm not saying I'm a master of manifestation. I'm just saying that quality of being is first. Now, ironically, when you find the trueness of who you really are, you don't need much if anything. Yes, you just are full, and it's from that fullness of life that then life can express back to you what you are already.<br>This reminds me of another phrase that Tom Campbell said: "This reality is built to give you what you fear." A lot of people don't like that idea. Guess what? It's okay. It's not that it's masochistic or cruel. Actually, reality is not built on cruelty. But if you have fear, which just means yet unevolved in this, this is the place where it gets pitted. It gets engaged, and that fear will tend to yield certain experiences that will help you, give you the opportunity to face it.<br>Yeah, so like in my case, I came to face a fear in this life that was my main intention. There was a certain very, very low-vibration fear I came to process. I inadvertently had been nudging the probabilities for 22 years up until I was 23 years old for a great trauma that happened to me when I was 22. It was deeply traumatizing at the time, but now I'm able to see it was an opportunity, and it was an opportunity that I knew before life was—I know this is gonna sound crazy to the human ego—it's like winning the lottery. Like, being given the chance to play a human was like being given a lottery ticket, like a winning lottery ticket. Like, "Oh my gosh, there's like being given the chance to play a human is like the biggest gift." And even though I knew from there that I was going to be engaging a vibration that would be so hard for me, I was so excited at the opportunity because I knew the profound opportunity in it, a profound expansion that could occur through it.<br>Okay, so that was a really long tangent, but it's related to your original question. Oh, that's just awesome. Really, really. You're an ego, and you know, how do we let go of our ego and the resistance that the ego gives us? How can we let go because life has its way of throwing situations at us? How do we flow, so to speak?<br><br><br>Yeah, okay. So, again, I'll just disclaim that it's a very personal question because each person's walk is very unique. So, everyone's way of processing their lives, processing their fear, integrating their experience, and growing towards love will be unique. But, in general, the comments we made before about rejection apply. Like, you put it this way: Life is not your enemy. It's not your enemy. So, as things arise in life, you don't have to fight as a separate self against them. You can recognize you are always the powerful knower of the experience. You get to apply all the interpretation in every moment. You get to decide what you will do with this moment now. You may have a lot of momentum built up, you know, over a lifetime. We think the same thoughts thousands of times. We have this conditioning, like we talked about. So, we get this huge amount of thought momentum, interpretation momentum. We wear a deep path in the grass. The path is well-worn. So, when things happen, we tend to fall back into the path that we walked. Yeah, but the cool thing is, just like a path of open grass, you can walk right off the path. You don't have to stay on the path. You can walk in a new direction. You can choose a new positive interpretation, a new momentum. And when you do that, at first, you're walking through fresh grass. So, you know, it's pokey. It's pokey. It feels good, but it's also pokey, and it's like, "This is new." But in this moment, you can build up new momentum.<br>That meditation is kind of like that, too. You are learning—learning is a bad word—you are developing a momentum of focus. Like, at first, you're in the river. The river, the flow is just hitting you, hitting you, hitting you. You can't stop. You're just getting hit in the face with water all day long. It's like a whirlpool. I've used this metaphor many other times, but I think it's a great metaphor. It's like when you're a kid, and you're in a pool, and you go around in circles, and you create a momentum in the water. Yeah, and then you just let go, and you let the water carry you around in circles. Yeah, our momentum is like that. Our thoughts are like that. We just get carried around in circles. But what happens if you stand still in the water? The water hits you in the face, tries to barrel you over, but just by standing still, you are taking energy out of the water.<br>Okay, so meditation is like this. That's a related comment to how can we meet the circumstances of our lives because our interpretations get so deep, we lose sight that we're even applying them. Stand still on the water. Just now, don't worry about the whole thing. Just right now, stand still on the water. Change your focus. Feel the life in you. Feel the love you have. Feel the sensation of breath. Feel the aliveness in the air, the aliveness in your hand and your fingertip. Like, direct yourself to that just for a moment, and it changes the momentum.<br><br><br>Anyway, that's just one comment. He's such an incredible speaker. I just—I'm so glad that I got to connect with you today because the way in which you answer questions and explain in such good and deep detail is so good for everyone watching because now they get a little more understanding into why we're here, what's the purpose, how do we just let go and just enjoy life. Yeah, and I just want to encourage whoever's listening is, like, whoever you are, you are not just a story. You really are powerful. You really are loved. Like, you are so loved. It's ridiculous how much you are celebrated and loved and how precious you are. I just hope that you take a moment to just recognize that just a little bit, just tap into it even if you think it's impossible, even if you think, "Oh my gosh, there's no way. My whole lifetime has proven to me that I'm not worthy of love." No, you are worthy of love. Allow yourself to feel that and know that a little bit so that today, just you can just be more yourself. You can go have more joy. Take life with less heaviness just for today. You know, like, we have that power, and that's not specific to just only to any one of us. We all are that. We are all free, multi-dimensional beings. We're all brothers and sisters. So, we're in this together. You know, we do what we can with this very dense experience we've created here.<br><br><br>Thank you so much for the opportunity. Thank you for your work. I said this before. I know that your channel is relatively new. I feel that there's a real opportunity, and you're helping people and sharing this message and sharing the realness of our higher natures with people is so powerful and important. Like, here on Earth, I feel like there's only really two problems: the one is fear, and the other one is ignorance. That's it. We just don't know who we are, and we have fear. So, if we can share a message like this, we're getting right to the root of the problem by helping people become aware of who they really are again and also by reminding people they don't need to be afraid. Yeah, like, this is the real work—the work in consciousness space, the work of encouraging each other and loving each other and opening up a place where we can remind each other, "You can be accepted. You don't have to be anybody other than yourself." It's a really beautiful thing, and you're definitely serving that energy. So, thank you so much.<br>Thank you. Thank you so much for that. I do need that from time to time because, you know, as we spoke about this earlier, we are bigger than what we think we are, and so it's nice to understand that. And I am thankful for what I do, and I love what I do, and I also love learning myself as well. Yeah, so thank you for joining me and sharing your message to everyone watching as well.<br>You too. I love it. Thank you so much.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2022/life-changing-q-and-a-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2022/Life changing Q and A with Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:04:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pre-Birth Memories and Out of Body Experiences]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=ip9kwnn7zKs<br>28 APR 2022<br><br><br>Imagine knowing everything before you were born. This is Robert Manny, host of Guys Guys TV, and this week my special guest is Christian Sunberg. We're going to talk about his pre-birth memories. It all starts right here, right now on Guys Guys TV. You can also catch me on KCAA Radio in Southern California and Guys Guys Radio, my worldwide podcast. Guys Guys TV, Guys Guys Radio, thanks for your support.<br>Okay, Guys Guys Radio, it's special guest time on the show, and I've got a very fascinating individual today. His name is Christian Sunberg. Let me tell you a little bit about him. When he was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. If you can imagine that, with that memory, it left him completely for his early adult life. But it spontaneously returned 12 years ago as Christian took up a meditation practice and went through a personal awakening journey. He also began to have out-of-body experiences, also known as OBE.<br>He now officially speaks publicly as he seeks to remind others, in at least a small part, of who we really are beneath the human play. Professionally, Christian has worked for 16 years as a project manager for a complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturer. He's the author of the book we're going to talk about today. It's called The Walk in the Physical, which attempts to succinctly describe the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey. Welcome to Guys Guys Radio, Christian Sunberg. How are you, Christian? Welcome to the show.<br><br><br>So, let's start right at the beginning because I went through your book, and I saw some videos with you and interviews with you. It's an interesting what happened to you. So, let's start at the very beginning for our audience. What happened? How did you remember these pre-birth memories? And as part of that, where do you think you came from at the point where you were remembering having the pre-birth memories? In other words, you remembered having pre-birth memories, but where were you in that pre-birth state? Where had you come from to get there?<br>Okay, well, first of all, I'm going to try to share using language because that's what we've got. But I need to disclaim before I do that, language is incredibly limiting. It just has to be said up front that words are form symbols that are based in the context of our local world, and who we are just fully transcends this local context. So, I'll do what I can to speak to it, but it's just absolutely not speakable.<br>Okay, so that's just a quick disclaimer, and I think that is important to say because I think on Earth we often think, "Oh, you know, we'll just put this story on it, put this description on it, this understanding. Now I got to figure it out." Well, the larger context that we come from is very vast and deep.<br>So, to speak to your question, how did this return for me? So, as you mentioned, I had pre-birth memory up until the age of about five or six. As a very small child, I assumed everybody did, and that memory left me completely then around the age of six or so. I had no memory of that at all, like everybody, until about the age of 30, which is 12 years ago. I took up a long-term meditation practice.<br>At first, I was just meditating because I felt relief from the stress and the bombardment of thinking all the time. But after a few months of meditating, I had my first non-physical experience, a very brief but very eye-opening out-of-body experience that really compelled me to continue down this path. I mean, it was very eye-opening and shocking, and I was just like, "Oh my gosh, there really is something here." Not that I was even trying to find that, it just happened.<br>As I continued to meditate, then eventually these pre-birth memories just returned very naturally and unassumingly. It was just like someone had blown leaves off of the ground or something, and there's the ground. It was so normal.<br>What was the first thing you remembered?<br>Well, the first thing, well, it's hard to say what the first memory was. I mean, to get you into time anywhere to realize that you were having pre-birth memories, what was the first memory that triggered the fact like, "Oh, I'm having memories of who I was before I was born?"<br>When the memories returned, it was just apparent, and they were kind of all at once. These things aren't like physical memories where you just have one and then the next, and then you're going to the store and then you're buying groceries. It's not like that. I remembered many aspects of the pre-birth experience all at the same time.<br>Okay, and the primary element of it that has stuck with me and that I think of even every day now is what I would call the process of accepting the veil. That is the vibrational distance between our higher state, our true state, and this state as an incarnated physical being. That distance is something I feel now, and I remember taking that step, that huge step, which is I can describe it if you like.<br>But it's very difficult to put words on, but it's like imagine your being being connected to everything, all things, and being totally full of joy and love to a degree that cannot be articulated, and having all-knowing there, and going from that place down, down, down, down, down in vibration. I like to describe it as a vibration because it's like a vibration in the being, a vibration in the field of your awareness.<br>I like to describe it using a metaphor. If you have like a sound amplifier that produces a pitch, and then you turn down the knob, you turn it down and you turn it down some more, and then you turn it down some more, and then crank it down more and more and more and more, that's what it felt like. And having all my knowledge be removed and my connectedness disappear.<br>So, when the memory returned, I recalled taking that step and knowing that I was at that place now, as a part of the physical experience. I'm in this state of being limited in a way that is non-native, the non-native state of separation. I don't know if that speaks.<br><br><br>Yeah, absolutely. And today again, we're talking about Christian Sunberg and his pre-birth memories and how that impacts his life now on the planet. So, a lot of people say that they come to the Earth plane with a group of like-minded, if you will, soul family, etc. Did you have any inklings or anything about that when you were kind of reviewing where you were and what the next steps were in terms of entering Earth as a human being?<br>In my case, okay, so in my case, my primary intention was and is to integrate a very specific fear, a low vibration state of being that before had bested me. Since my intention was specific, this is a long and complex process, but the guides brought to me a life, like a life package, you could say, and that life package was appropriate for the intention. So, in my case, my focus was not on exploring certain relationships with others that I had known before.<br>My personal intention for this life was more focused on being able to integrate a very, very low vibration experience, a low vibration fear, because of the incredible expansion that would be possible in meeting and integrating that experience. And when I reviewed the life before accepting it, I did review my parents, but I saw them not just as the human characters they were. You know, they're the souls playing those characters. The mother and father human are not really all that they are. That's just like a role they're playing.<br>And I was aware of the true nature of my parents, and I was aware of who they are as humans even before I was born. But in my case, that relationship wasn't the primary reason for my coming this incarnation.<br>So, you say, so guys, who are the guides? Were they angels? Were they orbs of light? How many of them were they? Did they have names? How did you communicate with them? And are they with you now on your Earthbound journey?<br>Let's try one at a time. It's a good list of questions. So, first of all, in the human realm, we think that reality is made up of an external shared environment with objects in it. So, of course, the questions that we ask one another are, "Tell me the objects, tell me how many objects, tell me the shape of the objects, and what do they look like?" That's just the way that we are accustomed to perceiving what reality is.<br>But it is only one framework. Ours is a very specific and dense and consistent framework, the physical framework, but it is only one state of being. It is a very specialized state of being. So, while there are elements to this that certainly are visual and have quantities and things like that, it's very important to disclaim that that kind of nature is very difficult to speak to in a way that makes sense on Earth because our higher state is not limited in the same way it is here.<br>For instance, here we're limited to discrete location. There is no limitation to discrete location on that side. It's not like you're over there, and I'm over here, and I see that you're standing over there, and I'm only over here. No, our connectedness is known, and another being can be perceived and felt as a part of you. So, I'm just saying that as an example because it's like, how can you even speak to that when the limitations are so much less there?<br>Okay, but to speak to the guides, there was one primary guide that initially came to me many times to encourage me and kind of nudge me about moving to this next step of the incarnation process. And that primary guide assisted with bringing me a life packet. But I remember there being a group of guides, and I can't say the number. It wasn't a focus on the number, but there was a group of them that helped me review this life plan, you could call it.<br>I like to describe it like a flowchart. It wasn't really so much about events in the flowchart, but it was more about what it would be like to experience being me in this context. And I reviewed that context with this group, however many there were, telepathically. This is all an exchange of information that doesn't need to be spoken in words, and it's all very thorough and full and instantaneous.<br>Like, I reviewed this entire flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of what this life could be like all within the blink of an eye. It wasn't difficult at all to do that. And so, part of that review was asking questions about the life and asking questions about what I could experience or who I could be.<br>And there are visual elements to this. Like, for instance, just before I accepted the life, I was in what I would call a waiting area, and I remember there being this beautiful golden light and just being in a place that was so peaceful and enriched. And this being coming to me over what felt like my upper left shoulder now, but again, there's no orientation in that way. It's like a 360-degree awareness.<br>This being coming to me and saying, "Go now." But again, there's no visual element to that, but it was very clearly communicated. And then, just before I accepted the life itself, the last, and again, this isn't linear time, so I say last, but it's hard to put an order on it, but I could say the last moment before accepting the incarnation, I was in a place that looked like what you could call a shop or something, a mechanics area that had a huge pit in the middle of it.<br>And I was kind of hovering over that pit as an awareness, and these beings that were there, I like to describe them as technicians or tinkerers. I don't know how many there were, but they were very mechanical in nature, and I could feel their nature and I could feel what they do. And they do this process where they make the veil fit for you because the soul has so many unique qualities.<br>And they review your qualities, and they know, in fullness, who you are, and they also review the context of the life, including the circumstances and the body limitations and all the rest. And they do this organic process where it kind of makes it all jive and fit. So, that's yeah, so I don't know if that speaks to your question.<br>All of it does, all of it does, and more so. When, what was the point when you entered the body to be born? Was it six months before, and you were inside your mother's womb, or was it when you were being born, your soul entered that body, and out you came? Or do you know?<br><br><br>For me, for me, I perceived it as a significant duration of time before the physical birth. I don't know when in the pregnancy, I have no idea, but I remember being in the womb after accepting the incarnation. And at first, almost rejecting it once again, which I've shared in my other videos that I've participated in. But I was overcome by fear immediately upon coming because the vibrational distance between there and here was so significant.<br>And so, that was in the womb when that happened. And after that, I was in the womb for a duration, and I don't know how long that duration was, but it felt like a long time.<br>Okay, let me circle back to something I asked you earlier, and forgive me, I've asked you a lot of questions in a relatively short time. Soul groups, sometimes we've talked about, we've heard about groups of people who come to the planet kind of together, and they're in and out of each other's lives. You may not know it while we're here, but when we go home, if you will, then people say, "Hey, you played that role, you stinker, or whatever, you did a great job." And it might be something that was even unpleasant because we were learning a lesson through that individual. What is your sense of that, and did you have that occurrence for yourself?<br>So, yeah, I do. I am aware that that happens, that we do make plans to come and play roles for one another. In my own case, the only thing that I'm aware of now is, like I said, that review where I reviewed for this life all that huge flowchart with the focus on being the opportunity to re-engage and process this one specific fear. So, for me, the relationships and the roles were not my primary focus this time.<br>I mean, it's possible that I have made some agreements to have some roles with some individuals. Like, I have two children now. I don't know, maybe the higher portion of myself has been aware of that or made some agreement, but I'm not aware of that. What I'm aware of is, before this life, focusing on that intention of trying to actualize the experience of going very far out in one certain vibrational direction and having a chance to process that experience. But I'm aware that for many, that plan may certainly include certain roles or relationships.<br>When you mentioned that you had to deal with one of your challenges in this incarnation is focusing and overcoming a low vibration that's fear-based, I want to hear more about that. Was it fear of anything specific? For instance, some people, for whatever reason, and I do hypnotherapy, so I know that nobody's necessarily born with a fear of water, but maybe when you regress somebody, you find out when they were three years old, they were at the pool, and their mother was having a martini and flirting with the lifeguard, and you fell in the water and thought you were going to drown, and you've been afraid of the water ever since. It was something that happened here.<br><br><br>Do people, though, come into, and from your perspective, Christian, into this life, and yourself included, with fears of something specific that they need to overcome, whether it's heights or water or rattlesnakes or spiders or whatever? Or is it just, for yourself, was it just fear in general as opposed to love, and that's something you needed to address? So, it's kind of a two-part question. What was the process for yourself, and from your perspective, do people enter into the world with predisposed fear already baked into their genetic makeup?<br>Okay, so first of all, fear, when seen from that side, is not a fear of a specific object or thing or place like we experience here. Fear is, it actually theorizes when we buy into a perception that is not in alignment with the truth of who we really are. So, if we're in a state that we feel powerless, for instance, powerlessness is not in alignment with the truth of our true being. Our real being is just totally full of power and has no limitation.<br>But when we are engaged in an experience where we are suddenly very limited, maybe we're stuck in a place or underwater or something, or we perceive that I can be harmed or I could be killed, whatever the perception is that we haven't fully integrated yet, that prompts fear. And so, it is a perception, a vibrational perception, that is really the fear. Objects just trigger that. Objects are actually fundamentally neutral. It's just that we respond to objects and contexts.<br><br><br>So, in my case, the fear, the best way I could describe it would be the perception of being unable to escape agony, unable to escape pain, being powerless to escape pain, mixed with being too proud to suffer. Like, I'm too, I can't, I'm not, I can't tolerate this, I can't handle this, I can't escape this, and I'm, I won't let myself feel this pain. That's the best way to describe it.<br>And the way that that actualized in this life was a traumatic medical experience at the age of 22 in China. But in a previous experience, I'm aware, I don't know the details of all of this, but I'm aware I had lived an experience where that fear had overcome me, and I had basically grown into an egoic monster. I'm sorry to say, I had harmed many others, and I was aware of that after I'd returned to the other side.<br>So, before this life, I knew that, oh my gosh, the amazing opportunity if I could re-meet this fear and re-integrate it and heal it, then there would be an expansion of being into that distance. You know, I think of fear as like a signpost of an opportunity for growth. We're afraid of that which we have not yet integrated.<br>And so, fear is actually kind of like a sign, like, "Hey, there's still some part of you that is not fully integrated the depths of this experience." And being human is one heck of an experience. It's extremely limiting, extremely dense, extremely consistent, extremely far out on the separation scale or whatever. It's very unique in that way. So, it has the ability, the potential, to prompt very deep fear.<br>And that is one of actually the great opportunities of the human experience. It's not that we are shy. You know, we're actually very creatively ambitious, and we see the potential personal growth and growth of the whole that can happen if we are able to meet difficult experiences and overcome them and integrate them. We are integrators of experience. That's what we are.<br>And as we integrate experience, what we're really doing is growing towards love. Love is the bottom line. Love is our true nature. And so, as we process darkness, process fear, integrate that depth of contrast, that's like a tool that we use so as to expand the depth and richness and fullness of what we really are, which is love. Like, you know, when you overcome fear, you're able to express love better and more in a more thorough way.<br>Absolutely. I want to go back to a few more specifics if I may. And this is Guys Guys Radio. My special guest, Christian Sunberg, we're talking about a lot of stuff, but one of the things is his book. It's called A Walk in the Physical: Understanding the Human Experience Within the Larger Spiritual Context, and that's exactly what we're talking about now. And there's so many questions I have, so let me see if I can get to as many as possible, and if I can't, I'll invite you back. We'll do part two because this is fascinating stuff, and I think these are things that people need to be mindful of and need to be present and need to be more aware of.<br><br><br>Because when we talk about fear, I've never seen in my tenure on this planet and this incarnation the fear dial turned up so high to keep people absolutely paralyzed with fear these days. And I assume it's some type of controlling tactic, but whatever it is, it's certainly prevalent. But let me just shift back for a moment and talk about guides, if it's okay, Christian. Do you now communicate with your guides when you go into meditations while you're here being Christian Sunberg?<br>No, I don't. I'm aware of their presence occasionally, but their nudges are quite subtle. In fact, one time I asked a gentleman that also has some non-physical exploration experience if he could check to see if I even have guides, which I know I do, but I was being a bit facetious. And he came back later and said, "Yes, but they say that if they interact with you directly, you're so intellectual that you will take what they have to say too seriously and rely on it too much." Okay, which is probably true about my personality.<br>Well, let's go back then to your pre-birth. Do you recall any other incarnations, whether here on planet Earth or in other places in the universe, the solar system, other planets, you being a different type of being, who knows, a reptilian, an insectoid, a blue avian, whatever, though you know that we read about? Do you recall any other incarnations as human and also in other areas and other places?<br>I, yeah, I have only three specific memories about that, though I know that I have lived at least hundreds of times because after meditation one time, I became aware. I saw these spheres of experience that I, that are me. I am, I was this. It's the same me that feels like me to me that has done all these things, not different people. But anyway, I'm aware of one experience where I was a woman, a female human, and I had given birth.<br>And I remember the childbirth being extremely painful and then having this same fear that I'm dealing with in this life arise because I was pregnant a second time, and I had fear about the pain of having to go through childbirth again. And I don't remember much about that experience, but I do remember this setting being very simple, you know, technology-wise or whatever, very simple.<br>And I also have one experience of, I know this is going to sound strange, and it's going out on a limb here, but I remember being some kind of migrating bird. I know that sounds crazy, but I remember this extremely spiritual feeling experience actually of being and a very physically stressful, like physically demanding experience of flying and feeling very compelled to stay with the group and a very different cognitive experience of that, you know, in that experience.<br>And I have some simple imagery associated with one non-human life, but it was some kind of intelligent civilization. I don't know what it is. I'm not going to try to label it. I'm very careful about labeling that kind of thing. It does, I don't think it's that important to label, but I do know I've had at least one non-human experience like that.<br>Yeah, okay. So, if people get this little game plan before determining when they want to come back, and then we have so many people on the planet itself, and this is a special place. It's a gift. It's tough, but it's a gift also because of all we can learn. Why do not more people say, "All right, I want to come back, and I want to overcome this thing and get this lesson, but I want to be Mick Jagger. You know, I want to sing in front of thousands of people or something like that or be a famous person or have this huge contribution," instead of being, you know, the guy who makes pizza or the Uber driver or whatever? There's nothing wrong with anybody who does anything. In fact, the real heroes of the world are the unsung. But how does somebody determine, "I'm going to be Derek Jeter," and somebody else says, "I'm going to be a quadriplegic," right?<br>Well, I certainly can't speak to the breadth of that process or assignment, but I'll say a couple of things. First, the spirit is extremely unique. Each one of us is so unique. Like, I know we all kind of look the same. We all have a head and shoulders and eyeballs, but the individual who we really are as individuals are like unique galaxies or something. You know, we're each our own universe.<br>And so, the history and qualities and intentionality and patterns of each soul are very unique. So, the reason that any given person may choose and wish to have any one given experience are also very unique. So, it can't be easily identified. But I will say that, first of all, I'm sure there are those that pick to have certain experiences that we might think are super wonderful.<br>But the thing is, the Earth is an extremely limiting place, and it's an extremely specific type of experience. The breadth and joy of our higher natures is beyond description. The joy is beyond description. So, this is a place we come to have a very unique and specific type of experience. And what I can say at least is that, in my experience, the guides, I communicated that with them, and I went over with them like what would be best for me as I learned and grew.<br>And again, this learning isn't intellectual learning. It's experiential growth, experiential learning. It's actually getting in the rubber-meets-the-road learning and actually being something, being a person, being someone who has to actually make decisions. And so, what that will mean for each person is unique. And then, in my case, the guides brought me a life that was appropriate, you know, that was a good match. I don't know how they do that, but I think metaphorically, if you want to think of it like reviewing a database or something, you know, they go out there, and they can review all the potential life slots, you could say, or avatar potentialities, I don't know.<br>And they review the qualities of them and the full context of them, and they kind of review you and say, "I think this might be a good fit," and then it's up to you to review and decide if that's something you're interested in doing or not. So, I think it's probably unique for each individual, but that's at least a comment I can make about the process as I experienced it.<br><br><br>How about from your perspective, free will? Some people say that we have free will in the same amount that you know a bull tethered to a pole does. You know, we have some, but not that much as much as we think, but we do have some. And as part of that, going through life, are there kind of check-off points where we may transcend, we may die, but we choose not to, or we may shift our path and get well and change our diet or this or that? And how much of that, you know, what type of elasticity do we have with free will for all of it that we experience here on planet Earth from your perspective? And again, Christian, I'm just asking you in hopes that you can illuminate some of this. I don't expect you to have all the answers to the secrets of the universe, but based on your experience.<br>Thank you, friends. Thank you. Yeah, no, and I really enjoy the, like, the okay, so the word you used, elasticity, is a great word. So, if I like that word because, so first of all, okay, the thing that has the real power always is consciousness. And so, consciousness is like the substrate that is, and then what does consciousness do? It wields intent. And that means, within a system like ours, it makes choices.<br>The choice that we make is not necessarily like we might identify our choice as being for some reason, but deep down, we have a real reason for making our choice. That's what I mean by intent. That is the real movement of the soul. Okay, so yes, there, I feel very strongly that there is free will, but it's free will within an extremely limited context. And that's the key.<br>Being human is off the charts in terms of limitation in comparison to our true state. And then, once you're here in the limitation, you get to decide whatever you want. You can make any decision you want. It's just that there are so many limits: biological limits, societal limits, space-time limits, physics, you know, all the things that you really can only make so many choices. And most people only are aware of a very small subset of the larger choice set that they really do have.<br><br><br>So, out of the very small identified choices is usually what most people are choosing from. But within the decisions that are possible, you do have free will. And what I mean is, within the limitations of the physical experience's context, you do have free will. And then, beyond the physical, when the constraints are released, you still have free will, but now your limitations are much, much, much less.<br>So, now, how does that play out in the physical is when I review the tree, the flowchart, there were certain avenues that were very high or very low in probability. And that just means that, at the time that I reviewed it, we could say the system, like maybe use a neutral term, I like the teaching of the physicist Tom Campbell. He uses some good language for this, but the system is really good at predicting outcome.<br>And because it knows everything, it has all the data, and the whole physical universe is like a big virtual reality that is being run. And it knows the rules of it, and it also knows every single player in the game pretty darn well. But there is free will, so it doesn't have perfect predictive predictability. It knows what's likely, especially because there are certain energetic eras that are occurring. You could call it like chapters in a play or something that the human race at this time is going through a certain era, and that movement can be seen and is understood.<br>And so, the probability of various avenues is seen quite clearly. But what's the variable that makes it not a certain avenue? The variable is free will. The variable is that each one of us is making choices every day, and we just may make choices that bump others in ways that are unanticipated. But that is exactly what makes this physical universe so amazing is that novelty and unexpected results can happen because that's something that can't happen in a higher state where all is known.<br>Here is a place where you set very strong limitations, and then you set the players loose, and they get to make choices, and now things might happen that are unique, and then you got to see what you do with that.<br>Yeah, let's get into the, I need to ask just for the benefit of our audience because it's the obvious stuff. So, there's karma, and there's consequences based on actions. And people say, "Oh, well, you know, if the universe is all love, and God is forgiving, what happens to, you know, Hitler?" And that's the obvious question that comes up all the time. And then, for our actions themselves, how do we, why should we even pay attention to the law if it's all forgiven anyhow? So, what's your response to those?<br><br><br>Yeah, there are two, if you will, yeah, there are two things happening at the same time that sound contradictory but are absolutely not contradictory. The first and more fundamental of the two is that we are absolutely unconditionally loved, unconditionally loved, no conditions, no matter what. And that needs to be bold, underline, maximum font size, whatever. We are loved no matter what.<br>Simultaneously, in the shall we say natural laws or divine laws that exist, we are all absolutely 100% accountable for every single action, every single thought, every single intent, everything. It all is a part of who we are. We could say, and karma is just a crude word that we use for what we could say is energetic accountability.<br>So, it just means, if you know, if I have a lot of fear, and then I become an egoic person because my ego is trying really hard to help me to protect myself from fear, and I hurt others, then when I get to the other side, I see I have that fear. That fear is a part of me, and so I'm responsible for it even now. And so, then it's my choice to say, "Wow, it would be best if I could really heal that and integrate that and move past that."<br>Because again, that decision made everything that I was is a part of me. And we are all like that. You know, we all have, we could say, energetic momentum based on the quality of our intention, based on the quality of our choice-making, and it can lead to future experiences, whether in this life or in a future life. And it's not some harsh, you know, like eye-for-an-eye system. That's not the nature of it. It's simply that we are 100% accountable because that is the, words are hard here. I'm always going to say the best way, but I certainly won't speak to the way spirit operates, but I'll just say that that is a way that leads us ever towards growth of love, towards love, and past fear and ego.<br>What is God from your perspective and from your experiences?<br><br><br>Yeah, so that's another example of a question where we like to think we know things are real, like energy and objects and people. So, is God like a man? Is he like energy? Is he like what? Objects have existence because of that which gives rise to them. And I know that sounds cryptic, but it's important to recognize the fundamentalness of God, of Source.<br>So, metaphorically is the best I can do. Okay, the metaphor would be that every soul is like a drop in the ocean, and God, Source, that's probably maybe a better word, is the entire ocean, the all that is. But it's not just an impersonal thing. It's also the full sentient, loving, beyond language, most personal source of all of us that is in all things. So, we could say it's a substrate, but it's also sentient and fully unconditionally loving beyond any comprehension, like very, very aware and real, more real than anything in this world actually.<br><br><br>So, people talk about manifestation, the law of attraction, and all that stuff. How can people tap into their godliness, go inside, and also from the sentience of everything, tap into God to heal themselves, to manifest things, to solve their day-to-day 3D type problems? How can people work with guides, work with the other side, be in contact with those who have crossed over, etc., live more of a metaphysical existence instead of our reactive existence and become more responsive?<br>Yes, more responsive to that deeper nature.<br>Yeah, so that is a very personal question for each individual because each person's walk with the divine will be unique. And that, I think, is really important to lift up because each person's process and the way they experience reality, in fact, is incredibly unique. But I'll at least make one tangible comment because we like, we need tangible things while we're human. We need something specific.<br>In my case, meditation was a world-changer. It was so important, and it was, you know, it starts as an activity. It sounds like a physical activity. Well, it can start as an activity, but it is very important to take that time to focus our awareness towards awareness itself, not towards the many objects in the mind that seem so real, all the thinking, all the stories.<br>And the reason I say that in the context of your question is, the deeper we are associated with the thoughts and with the labels and with the story, the deeper our experience here of separation is. In fact, it's very painful to think all day long. It's just very painful to only think you are the small story with these problems and these limitations, and I got to get this next thing, and oh my gosh, and then the ego is driving the bus all day, next thing, next thing, next thing. It's just very painful because our true nature is not so beholden to form as we have.<br>We've come so deep into this experience of separation that it hurts at times. So, meditation is very helpful because, as we redirect our attention away from these super important thoughts towards that awareness that is always present, that field of aliveness, the aliveness of your body and of your mind itself, with no need, just for a few minutes, just for 20 minutes or 40 minutes, give yourself permission. Don't, just for these 40 minutes, I'm not going to worry about all these very important thoughts.<br>You know, because your thoughts are coming in. They're arriving because you think they're important, so they're important. They're going to keep coming because you decided they're important, so they're going to keep arriving. Well, just for this time period, you just totally give yourself permission. These thoughts are not important for these 40 minutes. I'm just going to focus on, well, at first, you pick a neutral object, and I speak to this in my book somewhat because I think it's important to have something specific to do when you start.<br>But you start focusing on a neutral object just so you can regain your focus, you know, because at the beginning, you're lost in thought. You don't have any. You're lost in the river. The river is pulling you along. But over time, as you regain the ability to focus, you can actually let go of even the object of focus in your mind and simply be aware of the present moment itself for all that it is, be aware of the aliveness of who you are, you know, the aliveness of this present moment.<br>And you're not trying to accomplish anything when you do this, but what may happen is the deeper parts of yourself may rise up all on their own. I mean, that's how I experienced it is that, by going down this path, it wasn't like I was trying to do something. It's just that, as the stories were let go, everything else rose up. And that may include fear, by the way. I don't want to go down too big of a tangent, but if you let go of your ego stories, it means the stories that are protecting you, you're letting go of too. So, if you have real feelings locked down in there, they may rise up to be felt, and that's okay. That's good, actually. Feeling and allowing all that is is a powerful path towards what you asked about.<br>Okay, Christian Sunberg, my very special guest, we're talking about A Walk in the Physical and understanding the human experience within the larger spiritual context and his pre-birth kind of knowing. Have you ever, two questions here, and we're getting close to the end, but I want to get these in. One is, have you ever thought that or doubted your experience and said, "You know, maybe I just meditated this, and I'm just doing what I'm doing"? That's number one.<br>No, not since I, okay, because the level at which this occurs is more real than anything local and beyond a place where human, how do I put this? You know, here on Earth, we have to use thinking discernment using our thinking objects. That's how we decide things on Earth. So, if we're in that mode, of course, we will have thinking doubts. But the layer of being at which these things happen is transcendent. I guess that's the only way I can put it. So, for me, I have no doubt.<br>Now, there are moments when I may doubt certain thoughts I've had about it as a result, but the experience itself is not like that. Our true being is so real that, when you get in touch with it, it's not up for debate. It's not, its realness is self-evident, you could say, totally self-evident in a way that is quite immune to the ponderances of the thinking mind.<br><br><br>Okay, now you come to here. Part of your challenge was to assuage some low-level fears that you had, low vibrational fears. How are you doing?<br>Yeah, I wouldn't say assuage. I would say that I'm actually here to fully feel and get into the deepest nitty-gritty darkness possible. Okay, and I have been doing that. I mean, I had post-traumatic stress in my 20s after this main event because I had not integrated it. But through about six years of counseling, I healed layer after layer after layer, and I felt layer after layer.<br>And I still sometimes have experiences where this rises up, and that's okay. But the path then is one of feeling. It's one of allowing, not one of trying to make better and go away. It's one of actually, no, like, I have felt this way, and I will allow myself to feel it and know it and basically to know everything about my experience, to let myself feel all of what this experience is without locking pieces away, without judging, without putting new labels on it, just fully experiencing everything, even going to the bathroom, you know, fully experiencing that. That's what this is about, a full, aware, alert knowing.<br>Now, a lot of folks, and last question here, a lot of folks say that, and I've had a lot of guests on the show talking about, we're in a kind of an ascension time. And of course, linear time can be tricky because everything technically is happening at the same time, and we just see things linearly in 3D. But some people say that there's a split coming where some people are going to ascend to like the fifth dimension, and other folks are saying, "That's not for me," and they're not going to, and they're not going to recognize maybe ETs and things like that, and there's a bifurcation happening with the planet. What's your take on all of that?<br><br><br>Yeah, well, I don't know anything about a bifurcation. I know I've read about a bifurcation in Dolores Cannon's books. My wife and I are reading them right now. I don't have any personal knowledge of a bifurcation, but I do remember in my pre-birth experience knowing very plainly that the human race is now at this point in time, you know, was going to and is now going through an awakening process.<br>And that awakening was just like, it's just known. It's just seeing, yes, this is what the human race is doing now. We're waking up, and we're doing it rather quickly, and there's going to be some friction because there's a lot of old fear that is coming up to be processed. And you know, you made a comment earlier about all the fear out there in the world. I'm not making light of it, but actually, it's the fear in us. And that is old fear that is coming up for a large part, coming up to be faced and processed and healed precisely because we are awakening.<br>You know, we're beginning to question a lot of these old patterns and actually gain in awareness. And these kinds of discussions, I think, are going to be more common because humans are waking up. And as that vibration increases, the number of people that are aware and the depth that we're each aware is going to increase because that vibrational distance is very slowly decreasing.<br>Are you optimistic about the future for humanity?<br>Absolutely. Absolutely optimistic. Optimism is the only, there's no, life can't fail. I put it that way. Life can't fail. Love can't fail. Yeah, things can crash and die and break, but yeah, I'm very optimistic.<br>Fantastic. Okay, Christian Sunberg, my special guest. The book is A Walk in the Physical: Understanding the Human Experience Within the Larger Spiritual Context. Great job, really fascinating stuff. I hope we can do it again, and thank you so much for being on Guys Guys Radio.<br>Terrific. Thank you so much, sir. I appreciate it.

I'm Emmy Vadnais, co-host with Jeffrey Mishlove. Our topic today is pre-birth memories. My guest is Christian Sundberg, who, when he was a young child, remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While that memory completely left him, it spontaneously returned to him at the age of 30 through meditation practice. Christian is the author of A Walk in the Physical, understanding the human experience within the larger spiritual context. Christian is based in western Pennsylvania, and now I'll switch over to the internet video.  <br>Welcome, Christian. It's such a pleasure to have you with us today.<br>
Thank you so much. I'm happy to be here.  <br>Most people don't recall any experiences before coming to Earth, or some people even... A lot of people wonder why they're here, yet you have had an experience of recalling your pre-birth memories.<br>
Yes. I can share about that if you'd like. Let me just state before I do here, though, that this is not something that can be expressed with language. Our true natures are so fully transcendent to the form of Earth that as soon as we put words on it, we are immediately limiting it in a way that is often inappropriate. I'm very happy to share what I can, but I just have to make that very important disclaimer that there are no words that can possibly articulate our higher natures or the nature of the higher realms.  <br>I had no pre-birth memory for the majority of my adult life. I did have some of that recollection as a very small child up until about maybe the age of five or six or so, and then that memory left me completely. It didn't return until I was the age of 30. I took up a long-term meditation practice, and the memory spontaneously returned starting after several months of meditation unexpectedly, but it was the most normal thing in the world when it returned. It was like leaves had just been blown off of the ground, and there was the grass. It was just like, oh, no big deal. There it is, very normal, but it has very much impacted my life and my path because I have some personal awareness about what I'm doing here.  <br>I have a passion for trying to share with others some aspect of what we really are because we are not just human. I know it looks like we're human. We're doing a human thing. I'm a working professional in my daily life. I know how this sounds, but actually, deep down, the nature of what we are transcends the human condition. It transcends the human experience. We are individuals. We're spirits who are having an experience of being human. That's a really important message to keep in mind because we take our lives on Earth so seriously. We get so deeply wrapped up in all the concerns and all the stresses and all the fears and all the stories, but who we are vastly transcends the stories.  <br>We are beings of incredible freedom and love and power and joy. That is what we really are. We lose sight of that because we're veiled while we're human. We become obscure to the true knowing of who we are on a conscious human level, but that's a part of the game. We do that in order to have this experience. That's just a little prep, just a very high-level comment. I just need to say that first before I dive in. Would you want me to just dive in and share some of the memories that I've had?<br>
Yeah, we would love to hear.  <br><br><br>The timing of this is difficult to articulate because we transcend linear time. While these memories are incredibly ancient and they also do have a sequence, they also are all happening right now. They're like living a live experience, not just memory like we experience it in the human way. That being said, I remember long ago before I was ever physical, actually, before I had any physical incarnations, coming across a being who had been physical. When I came across this being, I could feel and know from him telepathically because there it's all an exchange of information. There's no language necessary, no spoken language.  <br>I could feel the quality of his nature and his essence. It was so overwhelmingly beautiful and full of power and love and just capability and expansiveness that it was breathtaking. I could feel this amazing joy and power. I said, "My goodness, do you feel the depth of joy and power and freedom that I feel that you feel?" He shared yes, and he allowed me in to feel what he experiences.  <br>I was completely awestruck. I was inspired. I was like, "I'm going to do that. What did you do to do that? I want to do whatever that is." He said he had been physical. He shared with me many things. Chief among them was that he had lived physical lives, and in one of them, he had suffered some kind of ailment, some kind of disease or something. I don't know exactly what it was, but it was very painful, and it lasted for a number of years. The way that he chose to meet that very challenging experience allowed a refinement of the quality of his essence, his nature, who he was refined.  <br>I really don't know what words to use, but he just expanded and refined in a way that was very, very tangible from that state of being. I said, "I want to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that." I was so deeply inspired. At first, he said something to the effect of, "Yeah, that's what they all say. It's difficult in a way that you don't know." Not brushing me off, but kind of like, "No, you don't understand. You don't know what this..." But I was persistent, and I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do that." He said, "We'll go talk to your guides."  <br>I don't have immediately right after that, but I know that I lived many experiences after that. I came back later and found this being again and shared with him that I was in the process, and he was encouraging when I shared with him.  <br><br><br>The majority, though, of my pre-birth memory experiences of a time somewhat immediately preceding this life, I remember taking a long break after previous experiences and just being reluctant for a while to return into the rigors of the game. It was like taking a very long weekend of being reluctant to go back, something like that. I remember this guide coming to me over and over again and saying, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" Putting them off and just saying, "No, I'm not ready yet. No, I'm not ready yet." Eventually saying, "Okay, I'm ready."  <br>Then reviewing with this guide what I can only describe as my state, like who I am, who I have been, who I was, what qualities I really knew and expressed. The words are so limiting here. I really don't want to pigeonhole it. It's very hard to describe, but it's kind of like just evaluating who I am and what I knew and what I understood and what I had experienced and mastered and what I had not.  <br>It was very apparent to me the thing that I needed to work on. I don't like the words "work on." It's not like that. There was this very obvious thing. I had this fear that had bested me in a previous experience. It had overcome me. In that previous experience, I was a very unhelpful, unkind person in that life because of this fear. My ego got out of control, and I caused a lot of damage to other people. When I say damage, by the way, I don't mean true damage because the soul cannot truly be damaged. There's no true damage, but I knew that in that life, I had been very unkind and unhelpful.  <br>This fear was just so deep. I could feel it and see it, and I'm like, "Oh my gosh, I got to do something about that." I knew, though, that if I could, there would be this incredible expansion of being, not just in me, not just of me, but of the whole. I don't know how to describe this, but this incredible expansion of what was possible, a refinement and an evolution of capability if I could know and meet and integrate this low-vibration fear.  <br>I could see even from there how very extreme this fear was, like what a low-vibration energy it was. I asked, "Is it even possible in all of creation? Has anyone ever, has any being ever done this? Has any being ever integrated something this extreme in this way?" I was shown, "Yes, and you have all of time available to you to do so." That was what was expressed, so there's no hurry. I just knew that if it was possible, I'll do it. I will do it.  <br>From the human perspective now, having experienced this life, it seems so strange to me at times to say that because I do experience great challenge at times, of course, like we all do. But from that perspective, I knew the incredible power of the soul. I knew that we have nothing to fear and that nothing can truly overcome us. We are incredibly powerful and expansive and free and full of joy and love, and that cannot be overcome. I just knew, well, if it can be done, I'll do it.  <br><br><br>Because they brought me a life packet, like a package, to review for this intention that would be optimal for me to re-experience this fear and to face and integrate it. That life was extremely appropriate. It was a great match for my quality, like who I am, and also for the intention of processing this fear. I reviewed this life in detail, and I accepted it. When I say this life, it's not this current life as Christian. This was just before this experience.  <br>I reviewed and accepted the life, and then I accepted the veil. This is the part of my memory I remember the most clearly, is this process of accepting the veil and the vibrational place that we are at now in relation to that higher state through the veil. I don't know how to describe this, but it's like a plummet in the vibration of the being such that all knowing is cut off.  <br>I describe it like if you have an amplifier that produces a pitch, and then you turn the knob down, and then when you get to the ball and you turn it down some more, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower more, lower, lower more, now lower, now crank it down lower some more, that was what it felt like. It was just an incredible drop in the vibration of my being. And I felt all of what I am like disappear, be cut off, be kind of like being erased.  <br>Very hard to describe the sensation, but it was like going from a place of high vibration connectedness and knowing to feeling separate and dark and dense and alone and not having access to my knowing anymore. And it was terribly dark, and within seconds of getting there, I was like, "I am not doing this. There is no way I'm gonna tolerate this for a lifetime. This is not happening."  <br>So I summoned my might, my strength, and I fought my way out past the veil. And I was successful in doing that, but I became aware that I had killed the fetus that was to be my body. I had caused a miscarriage for the mother. And just like a near-death experience just described, I had a life review. Even though I was only there for like, I don't know, a super short time. I don't know how long, but a very short amount of time.  <br>I could see very clearly how my fear had negatively impacted the mother by heaping grief upon her shoulders. And not only the mother, but hundreds of other people like in ripples away from the mother, I could see and feel how they were all, all their journeys were made more difficult because of my fear. I was like, and so from that perspective, you know, it's okay. Everything's okay. It's just, you know, it's just like a big play. Everything, everyone is okay, but I also very objectively could see, "Oh man, I got to work on this because I, you know, I had all these big plans. I wanted to have such a positive impact. I wanted to grow and participate in this amazing human game, and the opportunity to be given a human life was so precious, but I had wasted it."  <br><br><br>And so I, I kind of resolved, "Okay, I got to, I got to do something about this. This is, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try again." So they brought me now this life to review. And this life was not as appropriate as the first one would have been. I mean, I want, I'm not gonna put numbers on it, but it just wasn't quite as appropriate as the first, like the match. It was okay. It was good enough, but it wasn't like super, super appropriate because my spirit, my soul has certain qualities in the life of certain contexts, qualities, the biology, the parents, the context, everything. It's all, there's a certain fit that, that there, you know, there's a certain level of in, of a match or not.  <br>And in this case, it was, it was good, you know, it was okay. And I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail. It was as if somebody like, this is just a metaphor, but this is how, kind of how it visually, I saw it visually and I felt it within me. It was like, if you took a tree and laid it on its side and you started at the trunk and then worked your way out to the branches, I could see millions and millions of possibilities of how this life may unfold. What was very likely, what was less likely, it was like, like a probability tree, I guess you could say.  <br>And the only, and the thing that was unknown was the free will choice making, you know, of all the participants. But it's put, it's pretty darn good at predicting outcome. So I could see that certain at, like certain branches were very likely, and I could see that it was very likely that I would suffer a trauma in my early 20s, and that that trauma would crush me and give me the opportunity to re-experience this fear. And so I was very excited. Like, you know, from, from this perspective, it seems, I guess we might even consider like, it's not masochistic, okay, but I can see how some people might say, "Oh my gosh, I would never, I would never sign up for that."  <br>But from that perspective, I was very excited at having the opportunity to be challenged in this way and to be able to have the opportunity to meet this fear. And I made certain requests for the life. You know, for instance, I knew that it would be important that I would be male in this life, just because the male energy would be helpful for me to have a certain type of personality that would help me to deal with this fear. And I also knew that the qualities of my parents were important. I knew my father would instill confidence in me, and that it was really important that I had that confidence so that I would have a rock to stand on when the fear hit.  <br>I would, I would be strong enough in my own self to be able to weather it and have a chance to, you know, to really face and process it. And I asked certain things like, I asked to be intelligent again in this life. I knew that I had been intelligent in previous experiences, and they said, "Yes, you can do that." And I asked to remember a very small amount this time. I said, "I would like to not forget everything this time. Like, I'm just, I don't want to forget everything. I just want this tiny, tiny little sliver of memory, please. Can I do that?"  <br>And they shared, "Yes, you can do that." But I could feel from them that this is really hard to describe, but the contrast between there and here would be even greater. And so the life would be even more difficult if I did that. But see, I knew that even that contrast, like all contrast, was and is an opportunity for growth. So I accepted. I was like, "All right, let's do it."  <br><br><br>Okay, so I remember there having to be this moment to say, "Yes," and I'd like to accept the package, so to speak. I don't remember that moment, but I do remember being in like this waiting area where there was this golden light, this beautiful light. And I remember this guide coming to me all of a sudden like, "Go now," like grabbing my attention, like grabbing me by the shoulders very forcefully, like shake me and push me into, it was like I had to interject into Earth time or something.  <br>And I had to go right now, like not later, right now. And then I found myself in this, what I can only describe as like a tinkerer's shop, or a technician's shop, where there were these beings who are very mechanical in nature. It's very hard to describe. And they do this thing where they fit the veil to you. So like the soul has certain qualities, rich, rich qualities, like its own universe of qualities, and the human life and the biology and the context and all everything has a certain quality to it.  <br>And they do this thing where they like, they make it all fit so that the veil will be very effective and be worn properly. And they asked me one last time, "Are you sure? You know, because," and I knew that once I said yes, here I was in, I was in for the ride. It was like, you know, once you get into this roller coaster, you're not getting off till it comes to a complete stop, that kind of thing.  <br>And I said yes. And then I remember the veil coming over me, and this time, just struggling not to fight it. And one thing I hadn't mentioned is in between these two lives, I spent some time practicing surrendering my control to the veil in like a simulating environment, like a simulator. And so I just resisted, I just did not resist the veil. You know, I like, I surrendered and allowed this down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more, lower, more, lower, more.  <br>Plummet in my vibration and this knowing that I had be erased and be cut off. And once again, I was in the dark and alone and feeling super dense. It's like arriving to a place where there's just no heat, like arriving to the vacuum of space is a good metaphor, I think, like you just, you get there and you can't breathe, it's cold, there's nothing, it's empty and yet dense, so dense.  <br>And I remember sending one message back to the technicians, "Did it take, you know, did the veil take, like did I succeed in arriving?" And they sent one message back, "Yes." And I felt actually the sense of accomplishment because it was like, "Oh, I made it," like even just making it into a human life was a huge accomplishment.  <br>Then I was there for a while. And eventually, that same fear that I had the previous time arose once again. And I was like, "I am not gonna do this. This is so dark, this is so low vibration, this is so dense. I am not doing, there's no way I'm gonna tolerate this, I'm not having it." So once again, I began to summon my might and my strength to fight my way out.  <br>And when I did this, the most holy moment of my entire human journey happened. I felt the presence of what we can only describe as God. I mean, this is certainly beyond any word, like a human word like God, but it was the great I am of all that is. God is the closest word I know that came to me, and it expanded me back out. And I felt all of the universe within me, and I felt all the stars and all the galaxies, and I felt the churning bliss of our Sun.  <br>And the, and this great presence said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And it was incredibly comforting. Oh my gosh, it's not what I'm, I'm so glad I didn't, I did not, I didn't lose everything like I thought I had lost all that I am. That's how it felt to be veiled. But that message was so comforting. I'm like, "Oh, then I don't need to fight, you know," and I let go and settled into the simple existence of being in the womb.  <br>And the next memory I have is of the day I was born. I remember the shock of being born, this the sensory experience, all this cold and shock and light and touching and sound. And I remember I had no idea what was going on, like none. So bewildered and curious. I remember looking up at the nurses and just being like, "Who are these beings who are taking care of me?" And being so curious.  <br>And it's funny, because when I shared this with my father, you know, he said to me, "You were looking around with the most curious, intense stare I've ever seen." So I remember, I remember that intense curiosity. So yeah, so that's just a quick summary of the experience. I know that, you know, that sounds like a lot. I feel like it's just the very tip of the iceberg.  <br>I'm still very much veiled. And I'm thankful that I am. And I certainly can't speak for anybody else, but I can at least say, you know, that anyone who's listening today, we are not, we're not human. You know, we are that spirit of life and love that is so much bigger than this human experience. And we get so lost in this story. You know, we go down our life journeys and we just get totally wrapped up in all the stories and stresses and fears.  <br>And I know I'm not making light of it. But that is not what we really are. And whoever you are listening today, I just want to remind you, you are a being of love and joy and freedom. That's who you are. And you're very brave to come here into this amazing, awesome, you know, simulation to have this experience of being physical and light. You don't need to take life so seriously. You know, this can be an experience of joy and playfulness. And we can do whatever we want with it.  <br>You know, so anyway, I just, I just have to share that. And I'm not saying it's easy for me either. I deal with many challenges like many of us do. But there is, there is great hope in the actual truth, you know, because this thing is not like, this is not just like a religious, like, you know, belief for me. This is, this is, it's what we are. And deep down, we all know it somewhere. Underneath all the layering, underneath all the veiling, we know we are more than human.  <br>We are something that we feel maybe when we're looking at nature or when we express ourselves creatively or when someone really tells us they love us, you know, we have glimmers of it. That substance of joy and love and freedom is what we are. What an incredible experience.  <br><br><br>And in those moments of interacting with other spirit beings, could you describe them a little bit more for us? How many did you encounter? You mentioned that some of them had specific roles. We'd love to hear a little bit more description if you're willing to share.  <br>Sure. So the question is already laden with Earth assumption because we tend to think about reality as being primarily comprised of discrete objects and places that we can see and touch. And while we do experience realities and other environments in other reality systems beyond Earth, that's that we definitely most certainly do. In fact, they're even more real there than they are here.  <br>That is not the true real nature of what we are. You know, consciousness transcends form and gives rise to form. So I can share a few forms, you know, because that's what we know. But that's not really what's fundamentally important. Beingness itself is alive, and that living beingness can share itself and interact in ways that are even far beyond human comprehension.  <br>I'll say that in my pre-birth experience interacting with the guide, there were times when I experienced this guide non-visually, but I knew he was present and communicating with me telepathically. There were moments I experienced a visual interaction where I was in a realm of gold, and it was, this is very hard to describe, but he was perceived as a being of light. That's the closest metaphor we have is light. But it's not about like, you know, shape or anything like that. It's about what's actually happening.  <br>I know that may not sound connected, but like really what we're all experiencing is what we're like, how it actually feels to experience this moment. That's really what's happening is our actual experience. And so in those systems, our actual experience is what is being directly engaged, and that's more true than an Earth environment where there's like a number of objects.  <br>As for numbers, like the time that I saw the golden being long ago, we were with a large group of probably at least hundreds of other beings that were moving across this landscape. I can only describe it like the landscape of light, and he and I and all these beings were doing one shared activity, though he was far more evolved than I. In this way that I described, we were all still participating in the same activity.  <br>I don't know what that activity was, but I could perceive, you know, the other individuals there in that environment. So, I mean, I guess that's, I guess it's all saying, you know, that's not super specific, but like I don't try to get too much into the specificity. I mean, I've had out-of-body experiences where I've perceived others, you know, once again there, it's not really about like a visual perception.  <br>Like one time I had an out-of-body experience where I engaged the, I know this sounds crazy too, but I engaged the soul of my wife's ex-boyfriend, and I was, I shared with him, and I was able to feel deeply into him who he is, who he was, and I perceived it as a vibration that was like a universe of color and sound and feeling, and I was a part of him, and he's a part of me even though he's his own being too, and I could feel how we overlapped.  <br>So, like how do you describe that? You know, like what does that look like? Well, look like, I mean, the closest thing I could say is if you imagine a galaxy of thousands of colors, you know, maybe something like that, but it wasn't primarily about a visual experience. So, it depends on the experience, and it depends on how relevant, you know, that kind of data is.  <br>Yeah, and I'm not necessarily looking just for visual, I was just curious your general experience. Okay. But I think a lot of people are curious because they don't remember like you do. Yeah, so, well one thing I'll say is that the afterlife is certainly not just one place. I mean, goodness gracious, no, it's incredibly vast. I mean, if you think about how many places are there on Earth, you know, and Earth is just the tiniest, tiniest, tiniest, tiniest fragment of our universe, and our universe is just the tiniest fragment of a much bigger multi-dimensional picture.  <br>And other realities have incredibly less limiting rules than ours. So, boy, I mean, the variety of experiences that are possible, you know, it's beyond, it's beyond comprehension, it's beyond what we can even possibly name. I don't try to map anything like that. I mean, sometimes I have out-of-body experiences or, you know, other types of experiences. I'm just, I just kind of leave myself open, and I know the thinking mind likes to, "Oh, let's put labels on it," and there are others that are far more experienced in those types of adventures than I am.  <br>But I try, I don't try to put a model on like specifically other kinds of realities from here. I don't really feel like from the human vantage point that we're very good at doing that. I can at least say there's a vibrational geography. So, what you are vibrating at, and that means the state of being that you're in, is locational. That's, like, that's the simplest way.  <br>And most realities are thought-responsive reality systems in which our intention, our thoughts, our beliefs, our expectations have an immediate effect on the environment. It's true on Earth, too. It's just much, much slower. Earth is just super, super dense.  <br>Do you recall connecting with, for example, a soul group or are there groups of souls who tend to incarnate together?<br>
Yeah, I don't have memory of interacting specifically in that tangible way with my soul group. But I do, I am aware that I'm a part of a group, and I've had at least some interaction while physical, briefly. But most of it is internal, telepathic, not like a full-out-of-body experience.  <br><br><br>Could you share a little bit more about the veil and why we experience it and why many people frequently don't recall their pre-birth memories?<br>
Yeah, sure. So, the veil is very purposeful. You know, we wouldn't be able to have the experience of being this deep into the experience of separation, into being a separate being if you weren't veiled. Like, if you want to be the human, you got to be the human, man. You know, you got to be veiled to all of what, the totality of what you are and just focus on the human experience.  <br>And so, the veil is very effective at that. So, we wake up every day. We typically don't remember much about, you know, maybe we have some dreams or something, but we usually don't remember any non-physical experiences we've had while we're asleep. We just go right into our day. We get our breakfast. We go to work. You know, whatever. That, the fidelity of that super consistent experience is enabled by the fact that we are veiled.  <br>Veiling is just a, it's like a, it's like wearing a cloak of limitation on your consciousness. So, your consciousness pre-exists. And I know it feels like the consciousness is like shoved inside of some kind of real body or something. No, actually, the body is more like a context and more like a constraint set that consciousness wears. But consciousness is still first.  <br>So, there are states of being in which you can become aware that the body actually is occurring within you. Like, you can actually feel it very tangibly. Rather than it feeling like, you know, most people, I think, experience like as if you're inside the body looking out of your eyeballs, you know. That's just the surface layer. The veiling enables that surface layer.  <br>And the more we focus on that layer, so the more we focus on the sensory experience and our thoughts about the sensory experience, all of our thoughts and labels that we put on it. So, sight, sound, touch, hearing, taste, all that good stuff. And then we interpret and we buy into stories. And then we, then we set this thought momentum into motion. And we start thinking the same thoughts, and we wear these pathways into our conscious experience and actually into our neurology as well for these thoughts that we continually think.  <br>And then we just keep experiencing them. And the more we focus on that, the deeper the veiling is experienced. But kids, on the other hand, you know, they've come in, and they're not super deeply associated with the story yet. So, it's much easier for them to step back and, you know, come and go to the non-physical or to feel closer vibrationally, you know, to who they really are.  <br>So, why is all that necessary? Because, oh my goodness, this is a really important, broad and complex topic, but I'll just say very generally speaking at a high level, the contrast of this level of separation enables an incredible opportunity for expansion through the integration of experience.  <br>So, we are able to come very deeply into actually experiencing being separate here. And that experience of separation is actually quite alien. It's not native to who we really are. But if we can come all the way here, it allows perspectives that are not otherwise possible and then the integration of experience from and through those perspectives.  <br>And being human is incredibly unique and incredibly valuable. It offers such very, very unique, extreme, well-defined cognitive experiences and physical experiences that are not otherwise possible. And that is very valuable to the soul. You might say that we as souls are experienced integrators, you know, and this is one hack of an opportunity to have experience and to learn and grow through it.  <br>And by the way, when I say learn, I don't mean intellectual learning. I mean a growth of the being by being something, by integrating the experience of being something. And that growth of the being, we can say, is the expansion of love and joy. It is the processing. So, when we integrate experience, that means processing fear as well.  <br>And as we process fear and as we really come to terms with these experiences and really know them and know exactly what it's like to, you know, to be you in this place, we participate in the expansion of creation and the expansion of love and joy. Because love and joy is our true nature. Now, you could say that that's like the substance of what we are.  <br>And so when that substance is able to be exposed to or committed into great contrast, there is this refinement and growth and expansion of that love and joy through that experience. And so the veiling is as additive in that it allows that experience.  <br><br><br>There may be those listening who wish that they could recall as much as you are. And it sounds like you were able to have these memories come back spontaneously through meditation. What kinds of meditation did you engage in that helped you with your memories?  <br>Right. So, the human likes to think, "What action can I get what result out of?" You know, that's how we do things on Earth. So, I'm saying that in context of your question because I don't particularly feel that the name of the meditation or the process of the meditation is the active ingredient. Though there are some meditation forms that work better for some rather than others.  <br>For me, I followed a meditation offered by Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer in his book. I think it's chapter 23. There's an aside in there. It's basically transcendental meditation. But like I said, I don't think the name is very important. What is important is using your intent, taking time, we're in linear time right now, taking time to use your intent to choose what to focus on, to start with something neutral in your mind and control.  <br>Control is probably a bad word. Choose to use your intent to focus on just something that you choose and stand still in the water. You know, like the river of thoughts that hit us all the time. It's like a river just keeps hitting us in the face. Meditation is taking time to stand still in the water, and you don't judge yourself whether you're doing it or not.  <br>You know, you just use this time to focus on something neutral, and eventually, when you're able to control your focus so that you can focus on what you choose and not be lost in the dreams of thoughts, you bring your attention fully into just the present moment for all that it is and into the aliveness of your own consciousness, the aliveness of your own body.  <br>Experience it deeply in this present moment for exactly what it is. You don't put any stories on it. You don't need any labels. You don't need any judgments. You just dwell fully in the knowing and feeling of that aliveness. Now, that may seem to the human personality who's used to doing things as unproductive, maybe, or you know, like what is that accomplishing?  <br>Well, you don't go into it to accomplish something. You don't go into it with expectation. But what happens, though, is that as you become in touch with, consciously in touch with that aliveness that you are, deeper parts of yourself will bubble up, rise up, all on their own. Not because you're going and trying to accomplish something, but because you are almost inadvertently releasing your grasp, your death grip on the forms.  <br>You're releasing your death grip on thoughts and on stories and on sensations and all these things that keep us so deeply veiled. And as you do that, you will find that, yes, we're veiled, but we are never not on the other side of the veil, too. We're there right now. Like, the consciousness that you are extends past this human experience right now. It's already there.  <br>And so, sometimes then, through meditation, knowing of that, personal experiential knowing of that can rise up on its own. I understand what you're saying about meditation. While you're unique in having these pre-birth memories, there are various types of meditations which can help a person do exactly as you described, to be able to experience themselves and not have the thoughts whirling around and to be more in the present moment.  <br>And as you say, to also then be able to be a more loving, compassionate person. Yes, yes, exactly. Yeah, loving, compassion is like of the substance of what we are. It's what we are. So like, but the thing is, we all have fear. So fear means ego rises up to desperately try to save us and protect us.  <br>And oh, no, no, no, I'm a little, for instance, I'm afraid I don't have power. I have no power. Look at this world. I have no money. I have no, I can't control anything. Ego rises up. Oh, no, you have power because look, you have, you have money or look, you're physically strong or look, you have value because you belong to this organization or you have this certain belief, whatever it is.  <br>And I bring that up in the context of your question because, you know, when we look inward, at first it may not be obvious, but most of us have very many layers of ego going on. That's okay. It just means there's fear. And as we really come to terms with what our thoughts are, how we're using our thoughts and the quality of the intention behind those thoughts, that that's always the key is the quality of our intention is, is our intention in this moment based in love or fear and ego.  <br>And in so many cases, we have to be humble enough to find, oh, my goodness, I have so much fear. I have so many layers of ego rising up. Anyway, so I think I went down a bit of a tangent, but I just thought that was meaningful in the context of your question because that's one of the reasons it's so valuable is when we release the ego stories, we can face and process the fear and we find that love is always what we are and what we have then, always.  <br><br><br>Since what we are is love and joy, is there a purpose for us to experience fear? The way I use the word fear is not just another emotion. Fear just means yet unevolvedness. It just means there's some extremity of contrast that we have not yet come to terms with and we have rejected in some way. Something's too big for us to handle.  <br>And the human experience is full of opportunity for that. I mean, like I said, I experienced fear as soon as I became veiled, and that fear just means I really have not fully come to terms with this depth of limitation. And being human is an extreme amount of limitation, an extreme amount. I can't stress that enough.  <br>It's like going and climbing Mount Everest and then saying, "It's cold." Yeah, it's cold. Mount Everest is cold. Yes, there's low oxygen on Mount Everest. It's hard to breathe up here. It's okay that it's cold. The question is, what do you do now that you're here? How do you respond to Mount Everest? How do you respond to the cold, to the low oxygen? What do you do with it?  <br>See, it's not about the context. The context itself is, I mean, it's a real experience. The human experience is a real experience. But it's also an illusion. The context is an illusion. The forms are not fundamentally real. They're being used and created in, they're like tools. The whole system, the whole system of form, the whole simulation is like a tool that has been created to facilitate the expansion of consciousness, the expansion of being this through the integration of experience.  <br>So the question is not what exactly is happening in your context. The question is, how are you responding? What are you responding? What is the quality with which you are responding to this moment, to this thought, to the story, to the circumstance that just arose today? What is the quality of the intention with which you meet it?  <br>Are you looking right at it and really trying to process it? Are you owning? Are you trying to be open and bring love and compassion? Are you resisting fear and new ego stories to try to cover up what's really going on? You know, you have a free choice to do either one.  <br><br><br>When you say form, you mean what we perceive as the physical world. Well, form could be any form, whether it be a physical form or certain non-physical forms. A form is something that has distinction and is this and not that. If it's a tomato and not a piece of corn, it's a form.  <br>We think reality is form, and we think there's this shared objective reality out there and that's the ultimate reality of this matter. No. No. Consciousness is knowing this apparently shared reality of objective matter. It's like a simulation, a very, very good simulation. What we really are transcends form.  <br>Now, we often mistake, when someone says that, I think some people often mistake that to mean, oh, there's nothing really real there then. No, no, no. The realness of the life that we are is so rich and so full of everything, of life and joy and possibilities. It's wonderful. So when I say that we transcend form, that doesn't mean nothing is real or nothing matters.  <br>No. We create and use form and express form because of the creative and loving and joyful nature of life. So when you look at a sunset, is reality ultimately that yellow and orange? Not at the fundamental level, but through the yellow and orange. You may, at least in a small part, feel and know, oh, reality is beautiful, life is beautiful and this is an expression of that native beauty.  <br><br><br>There may be those who are listening and thinking, well, Christian, you're very fortunate. You've had this pre-birth memory and you're very enriched from it, but they're listening and thinking, well, how am I to, you know, really go forward when things are so hard for me? What can you say to those folks?  <br>Okay, so first of all, I am definitely not special in any way. That absolutely has to be said. First, I feel like it's natural for people to say, oh, this person is special now. No. No. I'm just another traveler on the weeds like everybody else getting stuck in the woods. We are all dealing with the limitations and the constraints and the pains of the human condition.  <br>I'm certainly not immune to that either. And also, like I said, it's actually very painful having some memory because the contrast between there and here is great, and I'm very thankful that I am not like I'm very thankful that I am still veiled and I do not have more awareness. I know that sounds backwards, but I feel like it's helpful for me to, you know, be able to have the capacity to really do my best to meet this experience.  <br>Okay, so but meanwhile, it's not a matter of, you know, having some great blessing to have this knowledge on a conscious level. Like to me, there's not a big distinction between those of us who have some awareness of that and those who don't because we all are that. We all are the being that transcends the physical.  <br>And I don't, like everybody around, everybody here is, has bravely agreed to participate in an experience of great limitation and veiling. And that was an incredible service. And we're all performing that amazing service. So, so there's not really a distinction.  <br>Okay, so I think the latter part of your question was so how to help those people? Is that what you asked? Like how can they be helped? So, I recommend, okay, so in my book, A Walk in the Physical, I do try to, the book is about trying to point the reader towards the portion of themselves that already exist beyond the physical right now.  <br>And by the way, the book is available for free online. It's not about money. If you go to my website, awalkinthephysical.com, the book page, the third link down, the whole book is available there for anybody to read. I want to encourage anyone and everyone that, you know, that wishes to consider the possibilities that you really are more than human.  <br>And as you consider those possibilities and as you spend time exploring, so meditation is a great exercise, a great long-term habit to get into. As you really commit time and energy into that, you find out for yourself. And as you find out the truth of your own being for yourself, there is always incredible relief and joy in that.  <br>Because joy, like I keep, like I'm beating a dead horse here, but joy and freedom is our true nature. So, you know, so finding that again is everyone's birthright. And for everyone, that process will be unique. That's why I'm not being too specific about my comment, because we are all very, very unique beings.  <br>We're each like a universe unto ourselves. We all have a unique relationship with the divine, or whatever word we want to use, the higher context of spirit. We all have a unique path to walk. So each individual sense for themselves, what is the best way to, you know, to nurture that and to go in that direction.  <br>In general, I recommend meditation. I also recommend that, you know, we spend time in mindfulness, being aware of exactly what's happening, try to become aware of, in our waking, you know, daily activities, what meaning we're putting upon our situation. Spirituality is not about searching for some far-off land, you know, some other reality that's not this.  <br>No, spiritual, spirit is here. This is deeply spiritual, this moment. So meeting this moment with fullness of presence and with fullness of awareness has so much potential. And so I, in general, encourage that, because if we do that deeply enough, we find that there is always peace and joy.  <br>And it's our own stories and our own resistance to the context that makes it so painful. You know, like usually when someone is saying, oh, that's not fair. You know, I wish I remembered. I don't begrudge anyone who says that I know how difficult this is, but, you know, ego, ego protests. That's what ego does.  <br>We protest because we have fear, because we have not come to terms with the grotesqueries and the limitations of this experience. We need to, well, not need to. It is helpful if we can meet even those great difficulties with love and not resist, not place our own judgment on the world.  <br>Try to really meet and heal the portion of our own lives that is not peace. You know, if you meet even one thought with more openness and personal responsibility and love and feeling like being willing to feel the feelings that are underneath it, you know, that quality of intention and even one thought, it helps the whole world.  <br>And it certainly helps you as an individual, you know, to move towards that freedom that is who you really are. It's not a picture of hopelessness. We all have incredible power every day and every moment in how we meet this reality. So that's kind of some high-level comments. You know, it's different for each individual, but just some high-level thoughts.  <br><br><br>When we feel love and give love, it seems that we can also receive more love. Yes. You know, it's funny because so often, because of ego, we close ourselves off to everything, because we don't want pain. We don't want the negative. We don't want the limitation. It's been so hard for us to process.  <br>So we won't even let ourselves feel love fully, right? But love is open. It's so open. It's so fully accepting. It's fully feeling. It's spacious. So when we allow ourselves to actually be vulnerable enough to feel love and love the person next to us, love whatever, to feel what we're feeling in this moment and love reality by looking at the sunset, that vulnerability is, I think of the word I use in the book actually, is a wide road to love.  <br>Because it's like in that vulnerability, that openness, you're dropping the ego stories. You're dropping the fear. You're allowing yourself to move vibrationally, instantaneously closer to who you really are, you know, that rich aliveness of love. So when we practice giving love and when we allow ourselves to feel love, yes, we will feel more love.  <br>It's a wellspring. There's so much love at the root of all things, even though we're many, many layers deep into separation and deep into the stories that seem so real, even though we've come all the way out here, we cannot change the truth of the very root of being, which is love without fear. That is the very root at all times and in all circumstances. It's beautiful.  <br>And love can continue to expand? Yes, always. Yes, spirit, consciousness is always in the process of expanding and evolving more, you know, ever-growing, ever, like an endless symphony of love. I don't know what words to use, and it never ceases to grow in joyful freedom and expression and love and creativity.  <br>Now I know you're not into too many definitions and putting too much form to things, but for our listeners, I'm just curious, how would you describe what love is? Our true nature is one. We are all connected to one another. We are all drops in the one ocean metaphorically. Love is the natural knowing and recognition of that truth, that you are part of me and I'm a part of you and the whole world is a part of me and I'm a part of the whole world.  <br>And love is the way that we express that. It means putting the other ahead of yourself in many instances, most instances. It means the expression of joy in the other. It means the celebration of what is and the celebration of the others. It means all that, you know, I can't possibly put an exhaustive definition on love.  <br>Love is just like the word life or spirit. You cannot possibly define it, but I think it's worthwhile though to note that the reason it is what it is is because unity is our true nature and love is reflective of the truth of unity, whereas fear is reflective of the illusion of separation.  <br>You know, when we feel separated and all of a sudden, oh my gosh, now there's a big problem. I don't feel connected to the whole anymore. I don't have my power. I don't even know I'm going to live past death. I don't even know how I'm going to pay my bills tomorrow. What the heck's going on?  <br>You know, that that state of fear, that's not native to us because we're not, our true nature cannot be harmed. Our true nature cannot not have what it needs. You know, our true nature is always connected and free and full of love and joy. It's only when we bind to perceptions that are not in alignment with that truth that we experience fear and that we suffer.  <br>This is the place to try to do that. This is the place where, wow, wait, I'm actually going to get to be separate and buy into perceptions of powerlessness. You know what I mean? This is the place where you get to do that, you know, and then see what we do with it.  <br><br><br>Yeah, but the truth is that unity of being and love is an expression of that unity of being. For those who are listening who may be feeling kind of down on themselves or maybe they are feeling some guilt or shame for something that they may have done and are having a hard time loving or even liking themselves and therefore it makes it difficult for them to like and love others. What might you suggest?  <br>Oh my goodness. Okay, I know this sounds generic and I don't know exactly who you are listening, but whoever you are, you really are unbelievably precious and important. And if you knew the value of who you are, the profound preciousness of you, like, like if you feel deep down in you, like underneath all the crap and all the trauma, can you feel the preciousness that you are?  <br>That is priceless, and I don't know what word to describe to all that is. And you are a precious irreplaceable portion of all that is. You are just so incredibly meaningful. And I'm saying that in the context of your question because then what we do, okay, so that's who we are. That sounds nice. I don't feel that right now.  <br>That's because when we're here, we buy into stories of some identity that is not in alignment with the truth of who we are. You know, usually when we're kids, our parents condition us in some way or society conditions us in some way. You know, you're only valuable if you, you know, go do this thing or accomplish this thing or believe this thing.  <br>You know, that's that's where your value is derived, and with enough rehearsal and, you know, that playing this over and over again, then we buy into that identity. You know, but that's not our true identity. Okay, it's a temporary experience of a character that we are engrossed in.  <br>So keep that in mind, please. If you feel lack of worthiness, if you feel, you know, low and unimportant, that is not the truth. That is somehow, there's some story, maybe many, many years in your past in this human lifetime, you know, that has been, that has been, you know, conditioned into you.  <br>Or maybe even there is a fear that you've come to experience in this life. Maybe there's a, maybe, you know, I can't, certainly can't speak for everybody. We come for many different reasons, but perhaps some individuals are here experiencing what it's like to have a perception of being worthless.  <br>Because in actually knowing that and coming to terms with it, we then forever know what it's like to have that, like infinite value, like, like, but in knowing worthlessness, we can know true value. So, so basically, try to sense how you are the experiencer of the story and of these conditions that you've bought into, rather than just the story and just the conditions and just the smallness that the world seems to prove to you every day, you know, that's not truly who you are.  <br>Yeah. It makes me think about maybe we can all recall ourselves as young babies deserving of love and care. Exactly. You mentioned that health is our natural way of being. And for those who might be experiencing mental or physical health conditions, you say that we return to health after this lifetime.  <br>Right. Well, we return to health whether in this lifetime or, you know, we're after this lifetime, wholeness of being is what we really are. So, we will return there. And the physical expression of us, the physical body with which we are so deeply associated right now, is also always trying to work back towards that.  <br>You know, constantly churning with the power of life, trying to, you know, get back to homeostasis. But regardless of whether, you know, whatever state the body is in here in the physical, the nature of beingness, the nature of life with a capital L is full of vibrance and health.  <br>And so, one way or the other, we will return there. And I'll just also make one other brief comment. And I don't, I don't have a lot of specific memory to this. But I do know that after, because when I met this being who had been so deeply damaged by this pain that he experienced for years, I asked him, "Were you healed?"  <br>You know, because I could feel how he was damaged. Like as a human, he was damaged, man. You know, like he, he really, I mean, his true nature wasn't, but he really was a damaged person. And I think so many of us can relate to that. But when we return to the other side, all of that is healed.  <br>And it becomes like, okay, imagine if you dig a pit in the ground, a hole, and that's the damage that you're enduring. Now that there's a hole in the ground, now after the life is over, that hole can be filled. Like now you've made a space into which the love and the light and the healing and the fullness of being can fill and rejuvenate.  <br>And that's beautiful. And then you, and then you keep that. I'm not saying that damage is good. I'm not, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that as we encounter the extremities of this world of contrast, including health challenges, you know, or psychological, you know, damage, whatever, whatever the forms of limitation that have seemed to overcome us or wound us in some way, that can be and will be fully healed.  <br>And then subsequent to that, we then know that like that's available to us. Like, oh, I know I, I now have experiential knowing of this depth of limitation. It's been healed. And now I know this, I know what this means. And that was something that I experienced from this being who I came across. He had been healed, and it was an incredible depth of healing.  <br>And I'll just say also that in my own journey, I have dealt with many health challenges as a part of what I'm here to experience. And also I dealt with post-traumatic stress at my 20s after this fear invoking experience. So I've dealt both with physical and psychological, you know, challenges to a great depth.  <br>I am not making light of it. I am not making light of the horrors, the absolute horrors that can potentially occur in the human experience. I am not making light of it, but I can say that life is deeper. Like, your consciousness is deeper than the deepest crap, you know, that seems to be plaguing you.  <br>You are actually deeper than that. It's just now what do you do with it now that you seem to be overcome by this physical limitation or psychological limitation? Now what do you do with it? Because there's so much actual opportunity in that.  <br>So basically, see the limitation as an opportunity. It'd be kind of like if, let's say you're laying on a weight bench and you're lifting 100 pounds over you and you're like, "Man, this is heavy." Well, now you got a choice. What are you going to do? You might as well lift the weight and use it for its intended purpose.  <br>And all I mean by that is the limitations of your life, the challenges of your life are actually opportunities to see how you will respond to them and choosing to respond to them in whatever way is aligned with love. And that will mean different things for different people, like I said.  <br>But whatever that loving way is rather than fearful way, if you do that, you are using that limitation in the way that it was meant to be used. You're lifting the weight, so to speak. It's like maybe love muscle or something. You're strengthening your love muscle by meeting this experience with love rather than fear in any moment.  <br>Doesn't matter what it is. Our limitations can help strengthen us. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. We sign up for, some of us sign up for very extreme limitations because we see the extreme potential in them.  <br><br><br>What is your relationship to the worldly religions and what some people refer to as God? Well, I personally still enjoy practicing world of religion in a certain way. I certainly don't feel it's necessary for me, but I still attend church with my family and an open-minded congregation.  <br>Historically, I've spoken at a unity church somewhat routinely, so I participate there. But basically, so we're beings of form right now. We like form. We need form. Form helps us. There is value in form. Whatever form is appealing to you to pursue the divine and to seek an actual growth of your being in love and to be guided, then that can be useful to you.  <br>It's not the form itself that has the active ingredient. It's how we use it. Take Christianity, for example. Some people use the Christian tradition in the most beautiful, wonderful, beautiful way. Just so beautiful. Just wonderful lives that are rich with service and compassion and personal growth.  <br>Others may not. Others may use it as a weapon or as an ego tool, and that's it. That's the nature of form, not just religious form. All form, we get to choose what we do with it. How are you going to use any given form, whether it be a hammer or a religion, in love or fear?  <br>Each individual being unique, there are times when forms very much will help us. Traditions very much will help us. I really enjoy the tradition of non-duality personally. It's probably the least defined tradition in that sense, but I love non-duality because it aligns so much with the piece of being that I seek and that I know.  <br>But I'm happy to participate in other forms of expression that also point to the divine in their own way. Really, all religions ultimately at the root, when they're being used in alignment with love, they all point back to the truth of being, whether it be the world is an illusion message of Buddhism or the message of service that Jesus teaches.  <br>It's all potentially beautiful and usable for personal growth. Is there a God? Once again, the words are very tricky, but to be the most succinct possible, yes. But that word is very, very weighted for many people. I personally love the word God. I've met a lot of people who really don't like the word God because of the context that's been used.  <br>But if you're speaking about the living, conscious, deeply conscious, loving, knowing, I am-ness that is all that is, and is both personal and transcendent and our closest ally and friend and source, yes, that exists for sure. The source is the most real, actually. It's what we're all seeking, you could say, actually.  <br>We're always looking for the satisfaction somewhere. We're missing something here. I don't feel good right now. What about now? What substance can I take? What food can I eat? What person can I pursue? What video game can I play? You know, whatever. We're always trying to fill that hole.  <br>We never fill the hole. We're seeking source, God, whatever word you want to use. The wholeness that is our true nature. I love the Rumi quote, "You are not just a drop in the ocean. You are the mighty ocean in the drop." And that mighty ocean, the whole ocean, which vastly transcends us and yet which towards we are working towards and are a part of, that is very real and I would call that God.  <br>But it's certainly beyond any language and any description. In fact, it gives rise to all form and all description and all names, all qualities arise from it. It's not like qualities preceded. So it's really hard to try to put words on all that is, you know, you just, or source. You know, source is, it's just not nameable.  <br>You're doing a great job. Is there anything else you would like to share today about pre-birth memories? Regarding pre-birth memories, I'll just reiterate, I don't think it's super important that we have memory or not, but I will reiterate that whoever you are listening today, you really are more than the human character.  <br>And whether you remember it or not, you did exist before you were human. You had some kind of pre-birth experience, whether or not you remember it. But that's not even that unusual because we have non-physical experiences every night when we sleep. We could just say, we are each extra-dimensional beings.  <br>You know, that's what we are. We are beings that are multi-dimensional and powerful beings of life, individuals of knowing and spirit. And that is what we are. And it's not strange then that we all have so many experiences in that context that transcend the human condition, even though we don't remember it.  <br>But while we're here, please do be encouraged. This life is an incredible opportunity, and there's so much we can do every day. We don't have to live in fear, and we don't have to take our story so seriously. This is just a play. We can use it for fun. We can have fun.  <br>And as an individual, you have so much more power than you may be consciously aware of. Not just power in the quality of your own life. Power to help and heal the whole collective. We're all connected. We're all part of the collective consciousness of humanity.  <br>If you meet one fear, if you express love in a genuine way in one moment, you are helping to solution the entire world, to heal the entire world. And that is a wonderful thing. And that's what we're here to do. Not so much the pre-wrist stuff. We'll get back to that side. We'll deal with that.  <br>We'll have a much greater vantage point when we get back there. For now, here we are on Earth. It's time to do our best to meet this experience fully with open eyes, open hearts, and really see what can we do with this moment. And that can be a wonderful process that's liberating, not one that's full of stress and difficulty.  <br>Beautiful. Christian, thank you so much for bringing so much love and joy to all of us. Thank you for being with me today. Thank you. And thank you, whoever you are, for being human. Go out and do something awesome today. You know, love someone next to you or just go have some fun. Let's do it.  <br>I mean, we're all in this together. Like everyone, I may not be able to see everybody that's listening today, but we're all brothers and sisters, all of us. And we are in this together, and we can do it. So let's do it. Let's do it.  <br>For those of you listening or watching, thank you for being with us.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2022/pre-birth-memories-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2022/Pre-Birth Memories with Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:04:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Christian Sundberg <em> Past Lives, Awakening, Spirit Realm </em> Ep. 207]]></title><description><![CDATA[

We have Christian Sundberg, a very special human being who, at about the age of 30, remembered his pre-birth experience. He remembers that he had chosen to come to incarnate and the challenges that he was accepting. He knew it would be hard, and when he came to incarnate, he was like, "No," and there was too much fear, and that life was terminated. <br>He's come to bring to our awareness just like our vastness and what we really truly are and our true nature. He's even written a book called A Walk in the Physical, and it's available online for free, or you can go buy it on Amazon or buy the audiobook. I always recommend people, if you have the ability to buy it, buy it because it just sort of completes the cycle of energy going forth from him to you to him to all the things. It's just so valuable, so beautiful. It really is like a message, as he said, of hope. I hope you enjoy.<br>Christian's wonderful. Please hit subscribe. I really, really appreciate all the subscribes. It really shows me that the show is on the right track and that you like the kind of interviews that I'm putting out there. If anyone's ever had any kind of pre-birth experience or just a spiritual experience, or if this information really resonates with you, I just really love to read the comments and see what you guys have to say and really just kind of richen up the web of this information. As he talks about, it's about sort of raising the temperature, so help raise the temperature.<br><br><br>How's it going? How are you?<br>I'm good. Nice to meet you.<br>Yeah, very nice to meet you too. I'm so fascinated with your story and your experiences. There's just so much in hearing your story that I'm like, "Yes," because I've been fortunate enough, and I call it fortunate, to have sort of out-of-body experiences, whether it's been just sitting on a beach and having some transcendental experience or whether it's been through medicine, plant medicine. There's just like this whole other realm, and the things that you say are right on, right in line with the experiences I have. I think one of them that I feel like so many of us can relate to, because we can use the word "dream" instead, is that when we're in a dream or in these experiences or having this pre-birth experience that you did, in this out-of-this-world stuff, is that there's no words for it. That is like, right? There's just no way. <br>It's like you wake up from a dream, and you go, "Okay, this isn't going to make a lot of sense." How do I even put this? The feeling doesn't always translate. You can't even translate it. So I just thought that I think that feels like some of the most resonant sort of connection to your story that we can all draw upon, that there's just no words to absolutely explain these experiences.<br>Yeah, there's definitely no language. Language is local to our world and our assumptions. It's like forms, symbols, and our true nature just so fully transcends that set of forms in this context. So there's just no way to put language on it. I feel like every time we even open our mouths and try, it's like we're just wrong right away because it just can't be spoken to.<br>Yeah, this is a weird, out-there question right off the bat, but do you think that we're supposed to get to a place where we don't really use words? I know this may sound strange.<br>It's all right. It's probably going to be a little bit. I'm a pretty normal, mainstream American guy, but I have had these experiences, and I'm passionate about speaking to these higher contexts as very real because they are. This is not a religious belief or mythology or something. I mean, when you have these experiences, they're even more real than this experience. In those contexts, many of those higher systems are thought-responsive. They respond to your thinking and your intention. <br>In those systems, when we interact with each other, the interaction is very thorough, very complete. We use the word "telepathy." It's just an exchange of feelings and ideas, and it's a very full and complete exchange. That's the natural way that we communicate, whereas here on Earth, we have to put words in a string and throw them around.<br>So I think we are moving in that direction, as you said. I think as we continue to awaken and evolve, that is the natural direction we're moving towards. This is a pretty dense reality system now. Our veil is pretty thick here in general, so it might take some time, but that is very natural for all of us to have that telepathic interaction.<br>To elaborate more on it, it's a space where it also feels like you come into a knowing. It's not even like there's time. It's not normal communication like on Earth, as you say, with this whole one word after another. It's like a river of information, and you know it was told to you, but you didn't get it told in the normal linear fashion that you do here. You kind of become aware, and it feels like it's so fast, and there's so many levels of information translated. <br>It's like the embodiment of it, which is, I think, when you say that they're almost more real, for me, it feels like it's so real because it becomes embodied. Meaning, I don't have to reach for the thought. I never forget, and I completely don't even need to believe it because I just know it's true. Exactly. It applies like I have to effort for it, but it's just there. It's complete, and it's at a level of being that transcends the level where we're here, and we have to think about things and deliberate and decide what is true, how does it apply to me.<br>What you describe is excellent. It's that knowingness in our being that is so complete. I like that you use the word "embodied" because we really do feel it and know it in the wholeness of our being in a very tangible way. It's not something that is so personal. It's like the most personal, real, and complete. I don't know how to describe it, so I think that was well said.<br>Well, it's only because I've been listening, obviously, in the last few days to just so many more recollections of your experience that it's so fresh. That feeling is the thing, right? So it's kind of that's the embodiment. They say that with manifestation, you have to put your body and mentally go there so that your body then gets the experience of having whatever it is that you want. So you actually become it. You realize it fully and fully embody it, and then you can let it go and let the universe take care of it in a way.<br>Feeling is an okay word, but it's even deeper. It's like a vibration of the being. It's a state of being, a fullness of being. So we do experience that in a very deep way, and then the universe is listening to that vibration. So the response back to us is in accordance with the vibration. That's why, when people talk about manifestation, we tend to talk a lot about thoughts or specific things we're focused on, but really, it's that vibration of being that is communicative and automatically evokes a response. Consciousness is connected to that which is, and when it vibrates, when it intends, when it is a certain way, reality responds naturally. That's just how it works.<br><br><br>What is the true nature of our being, then, according to your experiences?<br>Well, it cannot be described, as we said. We have to turn to metaphors a lot of the time, but we could say that the true nature of our being is unlimited joy and freedom and aliveness, life itself with a capital L. Consciousness or spirit, those are two other words. It has so much in it. It's so deep and full of life and joy and love that there's no word that we can put on it to describe it. <br>We could say it's the water of the ocean. If all that is is the ocean, then the substance of spirit that we are is the water of the ocean, and each of us is like a drop of the ocean. That stuff of the ocean can't be described. It's just so beyond language. But the thing is, we know we're the ocean. The ocean doesn't know it's the ocean. Right? Like, we can have awareness that we are aware. We have thoughts. We are aware we're more than this body. We have an awareness to it. We're not the ocean not knowing it's the ocean. There is a level of self-awareness all throughout the levels.<br>So it's very difficult to try to speak to the level of the knowing of one's being at a given level. I'm not sure if you're talking about it from this point of view of the human personality trying to look up and therefore we have some kind of cognizance, like intellectual cognizance. But at the higher levels, even at the deepest level, the knowing of beingness itself transcends all thought. It doesn't need a definition. It doesn't need to be quantified in some way like we do here. In fact, it transcends all that quantification and gives rise to it. It's deeper than the quantification, but it's very real and self-aware.<br>I'd love for you to elaborate more on that. I'm starting to get a feel for it, but I need you to keep going.<br>So at those deeper levels, they transcend form, and thought is a type of form. When I say form, I mean like objects, distinctions of some kind. This is blue and not green. This is up and not down. I feel well and not unwell. Whatever my thoughts are, thoughts are like little forms in the mind that we fall asleep into. "I am hungry." You have that thought. Now I want to eat a sandwich. I gotta find a sandwich or I want to grab the chips or whatever. The moment that you have that thought, you have fallen asleep into being that thought. Now you are the being who wants chips. That's all that's what you are.<br>So then, when you think about whether even the thought of whether or not source is self-aware, that's a thought too that you're having from the human personality's perspective, and it's valuable. But I'm saying that at the deepest levels, when you go all the way past all the form, that's not empty. It's full. It's full of beingness that transcends all form. I don't have words to use. It knows itself very fully and completely, but in a way that is much bigger than one specific definition. In fact, it gives rise to the opportunity for all the definitions that we're experiencing here. <br>We're like looking back from the human perspective and saying, "Oh, I understand reality from the form perspective. I understand linear time and discrete location, and I understand ideas and philosophy." Then we write thousands of books about philosophy and try to understand, and then we spend hours talking about all the different forms. That's good. That's fine. In fact, that's helping the all to know itself from their perspective. But I'm just saying that deeper perspective fully transcends all those distinctions that we could possibly throw on it.<br><br><br>Have you been drawn to plant medicine experiences to bring you into those spaces again, to get access?<br>I personally haven't. I'm interested in trying to navigate the human limitations in a simple, lucid way if I can, without some kind of physical influence. In fact, I've tried binaural beats. I don't even like binaural beats, two different pitches, one on each ear. I don't prefer that.<br>Do you feel, are you highly sensitive?<br>Oh, yes. I'm so sensitive to everything. That can usually be a total reason why somebody, I have friends that are highly sensitive, and they're not drawn at all because it's almost already sensory overload. Then the idea of invoking even more is just totally not a good idea.<br>Yeah, I'm not looking for a new sense experience. I'm looking for what we're speaking to transcends even the sensory. It's a deeper state of being. But yeah, I understand what you're saying, and I'm definitely so sensitive that I'm very careful about all that stuff.<br><br><br>How has that affected you and your life, being so sensitive? Because that can be an overwhelming feeling.<br>It's a daily challenge for me. I actually remember in my pre-birth experience knowing that if I, because I asked to have a small amount of memory this time and not forget everything completely, and I knew that that would necessitate sensitivity and that that would make the life potentially even more challenging. But I knew that even that level of contrast was an opportunity for growth. It was an opportunity. <br>But now that I'm here, I have sensitivities that just nobody else has that I do every day, like sensitivities to different kinds of light. For instance, I have not been able to find a computer monitor in the last 10 years that I can tolerate. I'm using an old monitor. Sensitivity to foods and sounds, but I can also feel non-physical information. I know this sounds wild, but I can sense non-physical information.<br>I think that goes hand in hand. Like, if I'm walking by someone, I might suddenly get a knowing, like we were describing, in my being, in my body, about who they are, who they really are, and maybe what their personality is within them and what they're experiencing. I feel like that goes hand in hand with the story and beyond the story. It's like who they think they are and who I tend to sense a bit of the true nature, who somebody is beneath the character because that's who we really are.<br>I love that. I relate to that on some level for sure. The challenge in that is trusting the information and whether or not you're just a good storyteller. Do you ever find that it's hard to trust either one or getting used to trusting it because, at first, you think, "I'm just really good at telling stories"?<br>Yeah, personally, I feel there's a distinct difference because it's not an earthly-like type of thought or story. It's a type of vibration that's very multi-textured, not something I can easily put a story on. In fact, sometimes when I sense it and I try to share it, I can't. There's no words. How do you describe like an ocean of color or something? Not that I perceive it visually typically, but I'm just saying it's beyond that language. <br>But I'm also discerning. I'm not real big on quick jumping to, you know, I sense that. I'm very open-minded but also skeptical, and I try to always have that healthy level of discernment. But it's not something I go out and seek. It's just like almost like a sense that is just so normal for me now. It's almost stronger than my other senses sometimes.<br>Give yourself a really normal, average guy, and I do have a normal job too.<br>Yeah, I do. I'm a project manager.<br>How does that work? Or how do you use it? Hang on, that's actually not even fair. Why aren't you just some very good psychic out there that can help people figure out where they're going? There are so many jobs that would tap directly into that awareness. How do you use it then because it's totally possible to take our special skills and inject them into regular life?<br>Yeah, that's a really good question. I navigate regular life every day in a way that I try to be the most genuine and authentic I can and utilize that experience because it is spiritual too. There's not like a difference. This entire manifestation around us, as dense as it is, as limiting as it is, is rich with opportunity every day. That's true even if interactions might be with someone who's not fully aware of the higher nature of who we are. That's the norm here. We're veiled as we walk around.<br>As for not applying it in a professional sense, I have not personally felt super called to do that. I have felt called to share messages like this and the writing of my book. I felt deeply called to do that, to provide that presence, and then step away and let life happen as it will.<br>Your book is called A Walk in the Physical. Did I hear you say it was free?<br>Yeah, I have a copy on my website that can be read online for free.<br>Wow. It's not about the money. It's more important, I feel, just to share the message. It is available on Amazon or on Audible. I'm really touched by the number of people who've reached out about the book. It's funny; when I was writing, I actually don't even feel like I wrote it all the way. <br>I feel like chunks came to me over six years, one bit at a time. When I made it available, I almost felt like it wasn't mine. It was something that needed to be in the world, and that was it. Now I feel like I could even just walk away, and it would be fine. So I'm excited about it, but I also don't feel like, "Oh, it's my book." That's not really how it is.<br>There's almost like a feeling like there's some kind of imposter syndrome to try and take credit for something you feel like you didn't have to effort for because there's this seeming rule in life that unless you effort for something, you didn't really earn it.<br>What you're describing is the true nature of everyone though. You're just aware you're doing it.<br>Amen. That's something that can't be quantified or monetized. When we speak to unconditional love, the true nature of spirit, the true nature of what we are, and the nature of source is unconditional love, fully giving, fully open. How can anybody put a price tag on that?<br>The most beautiful message that I got from my most deepest, soberest experience was that there's no need for forgiveness because there was never a judgment in the first place. That's how pure the love is, how true and all-encompassing and deep. It's literally everything. It's just like you're totally loved, and there's no need for forgiveness because there was never even a judgment.<br>Absolutely. Totally unconditional love. It's like we're already goodness. We're already innocent. We just fell asleep into the dream of form and into the fear. So when we fall into the dream of form, we have fear because we haven't yet fully integrated this. When we have fear, we have ego rise up, and the ego is just an attempt to fix this huge fear problem that rose up. Now we're all running around like a bunch of kindergarteners trying to make ourselves feel better. <br>"I'm better now because I'm a part of this group, or I can have this object, or I can have this power." Whatever all the millions of manifestations of ego, but at the heart, our nature is already complete love and joy and freedom and innocence. We are good at our very core. That is true of all people.<br>I actually really totally believe that too, even the ones that do bad things. You don't know what kind of experience they had when they were young or what's been passed on from the family generation through cellular memory or ancestral memory. You don't know what they thought they had to do to survive.<br>Oh, yeah. There's so much conditioning, and not just in one human life too. We're talking about a context that's even much bigger. From the spiritual perspective, from the higher perspective, there's complete understanding. There's complete vision. It's like, "Oh, I see exactly why you experienced the way you did. Oh, wow, you actually really were brave." You see the amazing qualities of the other, and there's just so much profound love that rises up for the other.<br>I'm reminded of an experience I had years ago. This is early in my awakening process, and I had an out-of-body experience where I saw and felt the soul of my wife's ex-boyfriend. At the time, I wasn't a fan of this. This is early in my awakening, so I had silly ego things going on there. But I felt about his nature, the oh my goodness, the way that his spirit and my wife's overlapped and how they shared this beautiful creative power and how his being and my being overlapped, and we shared this love of honor, this deep, ancient love of honor. <br>I could feel how in his life, he had been squashed by lack of love. He had been born into a family where he was not loved by his parents, and it felt like a car tire that rolled over a plate and flattened it super thin. From that thinness, he's trying to live and create. I was like, "Oh my gosh, I have so much honor. I just respect and love this man so much." Now, when I see him, we're close, and when he comes over, every time I see him, I feel like kneeling to the guy because I'm like, "I cannot believe so much he's doing with so little. I can't believe what you're doing here on Earth. This is amazing. I just want to honor his journey." That's how it is from spirit for all of us. We're seeing the rigor that we've had to operate in and through.<br><br><br>Talk about the in-between first, and then I want to work into reincarnation, the choices, and all that. What is that in-between life like, not life? What is the in-between a human life like? Is that essentially what you were seeing in that pre-birth experience, the in-between?<br>Yeah, so this context is very vast. We like to narrow it down to simple. There's like Earth level, and then there's like in-between level. Tell me about that level because here on Earth, that's kind of how we think of places. Even on Earth, think of how many places there are, and we're in a very limiting system. So I'm just saying that as a context because the scope of being and the scope of activity that is available to the soul when not limited to an incarnation is unspeakably vast. But I can at least say, from my experience, I remember having experiences in different layers that led up to the choice to incarnate and to be Christian.<br>I remember being in a realm of golden light. I remember this being coming to me and asking me if I wanted to go back yet, if I was ready yet, and then reviewing this life. I had a previous incarnation attempt first that did not work out because I rejected it out of fear. Anyway, that whole process takes place in a similar level, and there are many different places in it, but they're traversed by thought alone and intention. So you just intend or want to be somewhere, and you're there. There's so many different aspects of that I can't possibly put language on it.<br>I can say the closest to when I actually incarnated, again, this transcends linear time too, so that's really hard to speak to, but at the point that was closest to incarnation, I was in a place that appeared to be, as an example, we like environment, so I can at least describe one environment. I was in this room that looked like a technician's chamber, and it was over the Earth, and there was like a shaft leading down to the Earth, and there were these beings there that are like veil application technicians, something like that. <br>That place was very close vibrationally to Earth but still pre-incarnation, so I still had all my knowing. I could see the Earth, but I wasn't in that layer. I was not that vibrational density. The incarnation process is like a plummet of vibration down, down, down, down to resonate into this comparatively very, very dense experience.<br>In a way, you don't really actually go anywhere. Exactly. Everything and everywhere, you don't go anywhere. You just lower your frequency down so much to experience this super dense, linear, time-consuming, fear-based reality.<br>Exactly. You're like, "Wow, that's the freaking dark night of the soul itself." That's it. It's the most dense, most opportunity-offering, limiting. See, those are synonymous—opportunity-offering and limiting are synonymous. Opportunity is handed to us, and we don't actually ever leave. It's like the experience plays upon the movie screen of our awareness, and we seem to be locked into it. Of course, that's the very nature of being veiled. It seems like this is all there is. That's the name of the game, but our consciousness is actually still there. <br>You could say that a subset of the self is like committed into the physical experience, but the whole self is always outside of it. It's like you could say metaphorically it's like falling asleep in heaven to have the dream of Earth. When you wake up in the morning, you know you never left your bed. Similarly, when you wake up after physical death, you know you never left. You never were in any real danger.<br>I get very tripped out on how the universe works and the fractal nature of it and how there's just it's hard to put into words. I can kind of feel this sort of looping almost, and it's like a black hole almost. It sucks it in, and then new galaxies are born, and it feels like there's almost an aspect within us that does that. Because there's no other, I'm trying to rationalize, and maybe we're just not even capable of it as human beings, so maybe it's not within our sort of data computing capabilities.<br>But things like quantum entanglement and things like, I just, it can't. We can't imagine that with our linear life that we live here that something on opposite ends of the universe can communicate instantaneously. That's because the universe is virtual. It's all being simulated at once, so the communication is outside of the universe because that which is generating the universe is already connected to itself. It doesn't need distance. Distance is an illusion. You can think of it that way. Just like we believe in distance a lot, but distance is just a visual experience, a sensory experience, an idea. It's all these forms. It's an illusion.<br>But anyway, I like what you said about the fractal nature of reality because it very much is like that. As above, so below, as it's said. The quality of the spirit is such that we do have fractals of being. You have the source that has individuated into drops. You have each drop, each soul that is individuated into different personalities that appear from a given personality's perspective as separate, but they're not separate. They're one. You are all your characters that you've played. They're the same you. Anyway, so it is like that. It's like a huge fractal system within consciousness.<br>I just interviewed a guy named Chervin. He has a cool company called Symbiotica, and he's very spiritual and has been sort of walking in this world since he was like 10. We were talking about the evil forces that would be controlling the planet. Is there an Illuminati or a cabal, or is there a deep state? He described it in a way that was like, it's not that there's a group, and we kind of deduced it down to the fact that it's actually just a macro of the micro, which is that it's an aspect within us, like this sort of greed or materialism. It's on the micro version; it's an aspect within us, and that the real solution is not necessarily to point the finger and be a victim. It's to fix it within yourself because when we all do that, it's all fixed.<br>Absolutely. The simplest way I feel to put that is that it's all fear. Fear that we've rejected something, we're not okay with something, and so we grab for control. That's what the ego does, and that happens in many different layers. It happens in groups; it happens in individuals. But the thing is that that external environment is not the active playing field for real change. I mean, it will fix itself if the real environment is addressed, and that is consciousness itself. So the simplest way to put that is face your own fear, own your own crap in your life, and find the joy and the love that you already are that got buried underneath all these other things. <br>Maybe even got buried at the moment you incarnated. Now you're physical; you don't like being separate from everybody else. That's okay. Find the real you in there. Face the fear, process it, allow it. That actually helps the entire collective to heal because we're all connected. We're a part of one pond, one soup, and when one of us does that and really finds the love and processes the fear, it's like a light that goes off for everybody else in the pond, and it raises the temperature of the water for the whole pond. So we're not powerless. <br>We tend to look external all the time. "Oh, look at the political parties. Look at the laws. Look at the face your own fear and know that there's nothing to fear and that you are love and you are joy." If you find that in your life, you will change the world. That vibration will affect the whole world rather than being lost in this idea of hopelessness that we can't affect the world. That's not true.<br><br><br>There's a thought that there's like the three waves of volunteers that someone like Dolores Cannon has made popular—crystal children, indigo children, star seeds—that these are all waves of entities that come and incarnate as humans to help the planet. Is that true?<br>Yeah, I believe it is true. I didn't have specific experience with the three waves of volunteers in my pre-birth experience, but I did know from the previous standpoint it was just seen as obvious that the Earth is going through an awakening process, and that's very exciting. It's like the act of the play is the awakening act. So there is a calling for those who are able to contribute to come and participate because if we have higher vibrational nature.<br>I don't mean that in a duality sense because I'm not trying to compare anybody to anybody else, but if we have experience in higher systems and we're loving and involved and we come into the human experience, even if we don't remember, which we don't typically, and even if we don't know exactly what we're doing, our mere presence affects the pond because now we're a part of it, and our vibration is automatically affecting the vibration of the whole pond. So a lot of the younger people today are very loving and wise beings, and they've come into this world, and we'll see what happens. It's exciting.<br>What did they, what to do? So the Earth is going through an awakening process, which just means we are processing our old fear crap and moving vibrationally closer to what we really are, which is love and acceptance and freedom and joy. There is a huge vibrational distance though because the human collective consciousness has a long history with all sorts of nastiness, all sorts of fear-based ego patterns. But those ego patterns are being faced and processed by many individuals, and so we might see on the surface there's a lot of conflict at times. Well, that crap has to come up and be seen in order to be processed and faced and felt and healed.<br>So that healing that happens is something that changes the collective consciousness. It sets a new momentum, a new direction, which continually raises the temperature of the water. That's just the metaphor for raising the vibration of the human consciousness that is happening. It is in the process now. I'm energetically sensitive, like I mentioned, so I feel like when I go into larger groups, I can feel the difference now compared to even 10 years ago. There's still quite a notable difference, and we might look on the surface and say, "Oh man, everything is a mess." Well, there's a lot of fear in there, but this is happening. We are awakening, and love is growing.<br>I agree with you. As much as it's scary and nasty out there, the conversation we're having and a lot of the other conversations I have on the show, even with my friends, are not conversations that you could have with almost everybody. That's probably why it wasn't all that long ago that you came forward with your story, right?<br>Yeah, that's right. My body is 43 right now. I was about 38, I believe, when I came out with my story, but my pre-birth memory returned at the age of 30. So there was about eight years that I didn't share. I didn't feel like it was appropriate. I didn't want to take that professional risk, but then I just had the sense like, "Okay, the ground is fertile enough now. The soil is just fertile enough," and so I shared, and I'm very glad that I did.<br>The island is just big and big and so long. Even when I started getting very interested and deep into spirituality and curiosities of that in all aspects of it, I just was thought of as weird. I remember being called weird, and it was like I felt like I was on an island. Oh, yeah. You feel like you're on an island. So your island got bigger.<br>Oh, my. Well, there's, I can say with certainty, there are thousands of people out there, millions even, who feel like that. They sense, even if they don't know what it is, that there's more going on than what they see on the surface, and a lot of people have experiences and just don't have anybody to share them with. I feel like that's one of the greatest blessings since I've shared is I've been able to meet so many amazing people. There are a lot out there.<br><br><br>Did you come into awareness that there was ever a point in time on this planet where we were like the Golden Age? Was there ever a point in time where it was love, it was coherence, there was peace, there was a higher vibrational operating level, or has this been a sort of gradual increase since the inception of the planet 4.3 billion years ago or whatever it was?<br>I don't know. I would guess the second one, but I don't know because you said you aborted the previous life to this one because fear took over and was too much. So do we choose the life that we have? Oh, yes. Do we choose our parents? Do we choose our friends? Do we incarnate with a soul family to make it easier? Like, how is it that we come into the experience that we're having in this life?<br>Yeah, so we absolutely choose to come. I know that's strange when so many people feel that their lives are difficult, and they're suffering, and so many people say, "I would never sign up for this." We have really big balls when we're on the other side. We're like, "I got this." I think that about myself as I say that to myself regularly. I'm like, "Danica, seriously, what did you sign up for? What did you think that you had the balls for?" Okay, so it's so funny because what you just described, I actually remember doing. So I remember seeing the vibrational distance and going, "Holy crap, that is further than I've ever done. <br>Can it even be done?" Because it was so, in my case, it was one very specific vibration, one fear that I came to process and heal, and it was so vibrationally low that I was like, "How is it even possible?" And I was told, "Yes, it is," and I just knew like if it could be done, then I will do it because I knew what we are. We are unlimited, immortal beings who can't fail. We can't actually fail, but we can get underneath the weight bench and put 150 or 200 or 500 pounds on there and give it a shot. And then once we get underneath the weight, the thing about this weight bench is once you're strapped into the roller coaster, you can't get off. <br>That's the name of the game. We want to be committed into a context that we can't easily escape. That way, we have to be forced to face ourselves, to face our limitations, to face our fears, to overcome them, to see if we can really be there for each other in compassion and love and kindness even when it's hard.<br>So anyway, we do see that context pre-life, and everybody has a different intentionality behind their incarnation. It's very specific to the soul and their qualities and what they're interested in and specific to the life and the context. There's a huge variety there, so I can't speak to everybody, but I can at least say that yes, we do review the context, and it is a necessity that it be a choice, voluntary, because the soul, the spirit, is sovereign. It's a part of source. There's no greater authority. Nothing can lock it away. Nothing can limit it unless it limits itself unless it surrenders itself into a limitation by itself within itself, which is what we do.<br>So my memory then of I saw, I remember surrendering to the veil and that process of giving over my knowing and giving over my power and surrendering and even that prompting that initial fear because that's a huge loss of control. Why the hell do we do it? Is it exciting? <br>Do we look at this small fraction of time that we experience and go back to our more of our true nature, and it was a great experience no matter what it was like? It was like, "Wow, that was a thriller." It's like going into a movie that you got really scared in, but you came out, and you're like, "Oh my God, that was crazy." Was it? Okay, that's not a bad metaphor. Or is it because there is truly something happening that has a ripple effect into the universe, and we're helping with it? Like, is there a bigger purpose other than just like, "That was fun"?<br>Yeah, both. The latter is that we are participating in the expansion of love and joy through evolution. We're evolving. That's just a simple word, a simple English word, but I'm speaking about the evolution of spirit, that is the refinement of spirit. Now, at the same time, it's already perfect. <br>So I know this sounds like a paradox from duality's point of view, but when applied into the imperfect into duality, we are imperfect at a given point. We're only so good at manifesting, and manifesting is maybe the wrong word. We're only so good at actualizing our true loving nature in a given context at a given point in time, and we seek to push the boundaries and see how much more can we do and how much more can we know, like actually feel and experience. <br>Contrast is like a gift because it gives you the opportunity to experience the low so that you can also know the high. At the same time, it's maybe like if you take a balloon and you blow up the balloon and make it really big and then you lock it in place, you tie it. Now it's stuck with all this air in it. It's a little bit like what we've done here. We've come vibrationally down, down, down, down, down. We've been locked into a position. Now, in this position, can you make the loving choice? In this position, can you feel a certain emotion? How do you respond to it in this position? Can you find who you really are? Can you love the person next to you? Can you know joy here? <br>Can you overcome fear? How do you respond to pain or loss in this position? And then when you take the position back away, now see all that work that you did out here is magnified by that distance. You did the work at that depth of your being. It's like a depth of being that is, I don't want to use the word "carved out" because that sounds pretty gruesome, but a depth of being that is refined and deepened. And then when you take that depth of being into other thought-responsive reality systems, it has an impact immediately.<br>I was inspired to incarnate because I could see and feel from a being who had incarnated. Oh my gosh, he was full of so much power and joy. He was able to feel joy that I couldn't even understand. I picture it almost like a food pyramid and how, in a food pyramid, if you are the very top stop, it's like if you come down to Earth to this big base level, but you actually shift and change the big base level, it affects everything. Yes, there's no, it's like foundational. It's essentially your foundational awareness, foundational frequency. It enriches the rest. Yes, it enriches the whole. <br>The foundational level is actually where we start, but yes, it is like going down, down, down, and then it's like if you put on a 20-pound coat or a 50-pound coat or a 100-pound coat, you get to pick which one you want, and then you go for a run. And then you come back, and you take the coat off, and you're like, "Oh my gosh, that was heavy," but now you're stronger in a way that you now may have been enabled to do something or know something or even feel something that someone else who hasn't worn that coat hasn't felt. <br>So there's this allure, you could say, of vibrational distance. The deeper the vibrational distance, the more the opportunity. So that's why a lot of souls are like, "Oh man, sign me up. Put me in for the hard class. Give me the hard stuff." And then there's usually the guides who are like, "Okay, I think you're biting off a little too much this time. Let's rein that back in a little bit," and you're like, "Oh, but I want to do it all at once. I want to just chill out a little bit and try to find an evening."<br><br><br>I'm glad you mentioned guides because that was what I wanted to ask next about—guides, angels, ascended masters, ancient goddesses, like ancient Egyptian or Greek. What do you know about that because that all just seems like such a mystery land of like, were they real, were they not, were they just stories to help with understanding and coping, were they extraterrestrials? What role do guides and angels and ascended masters play?<br>Yeah, we can just say this: consciousness. We are consciousness. Your consciousness, my consciousness, so is every other being. Consciousness has a huge variety of experiential opportunity given to it. We don't have to be physically incarnated. That's just one thing. Not everybody goes to college or not everybody goes to Cedar Point and rides a roller coaster. That's something you can choose to do if you want, but not everybody does that. <br>So I'm just saying there's a huge variety of individuals, whether they're physically incarnated or not. Individuals tend to grow through experience or evolve in certain qualities, and so then beings who are very adept at certain qualities tend to be able to help others with those qualities, and we call those guides. Guides could be beings who have been physically incarnated or beings who have not, but they might be really good at a certain vibration. We also tend to have personal guides, a being that knows us really well and tends to kind of follow us and track us throughout the process.<br>I've heard that we all have like one main guide, one or a few.<br>Yeah, or a few, like three or four or something, but I know it's really well. So there's a huge variety to what that might mean. Some beings are incredibly evolved and powerful, so I mean, it's hard to get into too many specifics, but I'm trying to give a broad comment because there's such a breadth to what a guide could be or who a guide might be.<br>It could be a living person that we knew physically who passed on, and they have a relationship with us, and they love us, and because they love us, they come back, and they just kind of watch over, and they know from that side, "Oh wow, that was a cool video game," and then from that point of view, they can maybe help or guide or nudge, and then when we exit the game, they're there for us. So that's just another possibility.<br>Ascended masters, we might put in that category too. Those are beings who have had a lot of incarnational experiences and have basically mastered the course, the college, the physical universe experience. Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, right? Those kinds, right? Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to label any given person with any given title, but yes, that's right. Beings who have mastered the course and no longer respond in fear.<br>What does that mean, mastering? It has to do with fully integrating the breadth of experience that is possible here such that they are able to bring love into all contexts, even say being hung on a cross as an example. So you say the names don't matter, but if these ascended masters are to help us and they are helpful, they are able to attune to a certain frequency that they're most helpful with.<br>Yeah, I didn't mean to say the names don't matter. I just meant I didn't want to draw a distinction between, "Oh, this person isn't an ascended master, and that one isn't." I'm not going to do that, but the names are to be able to access that frequency, tune into it, so it's helpful to still address them. Right? It's still, if you want to say, "Jesus, I need your help with this," like, what does that do?<br>Yeah, it's like a Google search, except in spirit, the Google search engine's way better, way faster, and always listening. And it's your intention that is really entering the search engine, and the name or the form is just the way the system can interpret that very successfully. So like, you don't even need to call a person by their name in your mind. Of course, if you have a loved one that passed, you don't need to say, "Okay, loved one, name so and so." If you just intend and have that love in your heart and reach out with your mind and with your intention, it's intention that is the movement of consciousness that is automatically having an effect. Same thing with calling out to an ascended master, for instance.<br>Is it easy for you to have this kind of intentional dialogue with any entity or energy that you want?<br>No, I'm quite veiled. I'm very much veiled, and I'm thankful that I am, but I do feel that I have a constant interaction with spirit and God, you could say. I'm not super careful in my own mind about different distinctive names because once you sense the oneness of being that we are, all the form definitions and walls are so much less relevant. They're just much less relevant. I'm not saying they're not important, but they're less relevant.<br>If you were to call out whatever you feel like your greatest skill or spiritual skill is, what is it?<br>Oh, boy. I am deeply, at a soul level, interested in understanding dimensional cross-dimensional expression and how do I describe this? It's really hard to describe these things—cross-dimensional knowing and like a system context mastery and then being able to hopefully quantify it in a concise way. I love that, and I feel like my book, A Walk in the Physical, for instance, is my attempt, as a physical human, to try to bring down that very vast and succinct digestible language. That's something that my soul loves to do. I don't, I will say a skill or whatever, we all do have things we're strong at. I feel like that cross-dimensional proficiency might say is something that is a great joy to me.<br>How has that helped you in your life?<br>That's what we are. I mean, when you know what we really are, we are joy. So the question is a little bit like saying, "How does joy help you in your life?" Joy is not about unnecessarily even a physical outcome. It's just when you know joy, it's wonderful because that's what we are, and when we can feel joy and know that joy here, wow, because here, like I said, we're locked all the way out in this position. If we can find who we are here and express it and share it with each other and love each other and really authentically meet each other, even in a simple way, like a small way, oh my gosh, it's so powerful. I take joy in that if possible.<br>I mean, I'm still very much veiled. I have my own personal great limitations. I have fear still, of course. I have challenges like every other human, of course, but the question is what do we do with the challenges and how do we allow that true nature to meet the challenges? Honestly, authentically, really honest with ourselves. Where am I weak? What fear have I locked away that I don't want to feel today? What feeling have I not wanted to feel today? What self-belief or whatever the thing is that's triggering, anytime we feel anything negative, what is the illusion that I have bought into?<br>I love the idea that if anything feels uncomfortable or feels bad, it's because whatever that thing is is out of resonance with your true self. That's right. Your true self is never that. So if you don't feel good, it's because you're out of resonance. Something is putting you in a position where you have to do something or say something or be someone, and it's not who you are. You've bought into a self-perception that is not in alignment with the truth of who you are. So, for instance, deep down, if on the surface it might be, "This person flicked me off on the interstate, and now I'm mad," but deep underneath all the layers of ego, what really might be going on is, "I feel powerless, and I'm upset that I feel powerless." <br>Whatever it is, whatever that negative self-perception at the root is that you think reality is proving to you, that negative self-perception of feeling either powerless or unworthy of love or not having freedom, those are not in alignment with the truth. The truth is you are a powerful being. You are unconditionally loved. You are love itself, and you are completely and totally free. But when you lose yourself in the idea of not being free, that hurts. That triggers fear. When you lose yourself in the idea of being shameful, unworthy of love, that sucks because it's not true. <br>So whenever we have that negative, we can honestly look inside of ourselves and say, "Where do I have fear, and what negative self-perception has the world seemed to prove to me?" The illusion of the world, I might add, has it seemed to prove to me is real. It's just not really fundamentally real, but it's giving you the opportunity to be really in your face and really give you the chance to identify with potentially these perceptions and play with them.<br>What kind of powers do we have here? I get that we're infinite beings, we're all these things, but it doesn't feel practical. What are our tools here, and what are we stepping into? Because it does feel like we're stepping into something, we're moving into another level of us that has access to more of something. So what are our tools here right now, and what should we be working to cultivate?<br>Right, so on a practical level, we are constantly affecting reality, physical reality, all the time. We're nudging the probabilities all the time. I know most people believe in an objective material world. It only appears to be an objective material world. It's actually probabilistic in nature. Our intention does affect outcome all the time. So that's just one thing. It's not predetermined. It's a probabilistic reality where intention is constantly nudging all the time. <br>So I'm just pointing out that mechanism, but what's the power behind that mechanism, and that is intent. Our true power is our intent. What are we really intending in this moment? How are we really using this moment? You could say the most direct way to comment on that question is, "What is your relationship to this moment? <br>Are you making it an enemy, or are you in love with it? Is it in love with you? If it's not in love with you, and you're not in love with it, that's okay. Find out where you bought into something that made it an enemy. Oh, because I went through years and years of trauma, and I was, you know, whatever the story is that immediately rises up in anger because the ego is pissed. It raises its righteous fist and says, "I have good reason to call this universe cruel and me a victim." <br>Are you willing to let go of that actually and find how you actually do have the power to even feel that negative fear, whatever it was you locked away, whatever it was that all those years of abuse or whatever it was seemed to prove to you? Are you willing to actually go feel that and honor yourself, love yourself enough to actually meet your own experience all the way?<br>Now, that may sound indirect to your question, but it's not indirect because the quality of our experience directly is reflective of the quality of what we've done within ourselves as spirit. When you go into these dark aspects of yourself, something you fear or something that you're jealous of or something that you're angry about, you have to go through the pain. It's like, on a micro level, that's what's happening here on Earth, but on a macro level, you go, "I'm going to go into this incarnation to learn this thing to elevate to a higher level out here," and it's just sort of bigger and smaller versions of it, but they're all the self.<br>There's an important point here that I think is often missed. Sometimes when we hear a conversation like this, we think, "Oh, there's something I need to do, and the thing I need to do is to go face my fears and do these things." Okay, that's true, but there's something deeper than the doing, and that is your actual willingness to feel or to be or to do whatever. <br>I'm pointing that up because you mentioned avoiding pain. Willingness to feel the pain, this willingness I'm talking about means for the pain that you've buried away your whole life. This is not about avoiding that anymore. If you really want to open up all the gates, it's about actually being willing to go feel the pain. Willingness means you no longer make an enemy. <br>You say, "You know what, I feel powerless to this, but I'm going to feel it anyway. I'm going to go see. I'm going to go into the dark closet and see, is this thing really going to destroy me or not?" And that requires feeling. It's a very personal and genuine and real process. It's not about, as humans on the surface, we're all about activity. "Do this activity, get this result. Tell me what activity I can do so I can get away from this pain that I have." <br>This is more than activity. It's who you are. It's the actual quality of choice that you make, and the universe is watching that. It's not watching necessarily the activity. It's watching your willingness to admit your issues, to all in yourself, to own your pain, to feel your pain, to actually help the person next to you, to actually be willing to choose joy even though that might mean that you have to be vulnerable to be full of joy right now, to be a little kid and run around and play in the sun. You know what I mean? Like, that's a quality of being choice. It's not primarily about an action.<br><br><br>Where are we going? Are humans not going to be humans as we know it, or something completely different? Yeah, where are we going? I'm understanding your question to me where are we going as a physical species, but I want to comment in the context though that we're not human. I know that sounds totally crazy, but we're not human. You're the you that feels like you to you. That's who you are, and you just think that "you" means human really deeply, but that's not what you are. <br>So where are we going? We are the players. We are the souls. We're going even beyond the limitation of the human condition. We're going into experiences I can't possibly even imagine yet name, but as a physical species, the physical species will end up over time reflecting more and more that limitless nature of spirit. It just might take what we would consider a long time, which is not a big deal to spirit. Linear time is of creation anyway. It's not a big deal.<br>Do you remember other lives that you had, non-human or?<br>I have some, yeah. I have some snippets of experiences that you remember. Well, I know I've had hundreds of other incarnative experiences, but I only remember snippets from a few. I remember a couple that are non-human, and I remember one as a human woman. So if I get curious and try to investigate, I usually get this gentle nudge like, "No, you don't need to go see that right now," and I'm fine with that. I'm like, "Okay, no problem." I'm Christian right now, so I know that I've had other experiences. And when I say I've had other experiences, that's really important. It's not because sometimes I think when we think of reincarnation, we think, "Oh, those are other people, and I'm them." No, it's you. It's the same. <br>If you go do something on Monday night and then you go to something on Tuesday night, like you go to dinner one night, go to a movie the next night, go to a race car track the next night, whatever it is, still you going to each of those experiences. There's not really a different person. You might be a slightly different person on Tuesday night than you were on Monday night, and you might be a slightly different person on Wednesday night than Tuesday night. That's how it is as a soul. We have one experience, and then we have another experience, but it's the same you. So you're never not going to be you.<br><br><br>Processing trauma and going into these dark spaces that we're afraid to go and becoming a different person or being afraid almost that you'll become a different person, it's like you'll never lose your essence ever. Absolutely. Your home frequency that people feel won't ever change. It's really just about you changing how you feel in that frequency. That's the crazy thing about growth and becoming more of an observer and not getting so wrapped up in things and getting so pulled and torn and victim and that and division. It's like you actually, your reality sometimes changes.<br>There's definitely no bones about it. Sometimes some things in your reality change, but for the most part, you just feel better in it. So what feels not good is when you've associated with things that you're not. That's what feels not good—fakeness, negative self-perceptions that aren't you. The real you is full of joy. You're a joyful being. You are you just it. And I like, you know, you might say, "No, no, no, I have this long story, like I said, all this history that proves to me that that's not true." That's okay. You've had that experience. Now, now what? You're still you. You're still the joyful you underneath all those layers always.<br>It's really a message of hope. I mean, we come so far deep into this human experience, we really get lost in the story, and it's an opportunity. It's a gift, and we've become so lost now that we kind of made it into a little bit of a nightmare sometimes, you know what I mean? But now that we're here, we still haven't. We never lose who we really are. The question is what do we do now in this moment with remembering even just a little bit? <br>When I say remember who you are, I don't mean you need to have a big, grand experience. I'm talking like when you look at the sunset and you feel the joy in your body or you feel like, "Oh my gosh, life is good," and notice how that is not just a feeling or an idea. It's your very stuff, your very nature, your being, your consciousness itself actually is that reflecting back to you in the form of a sunset. That's all. It's beautiful.<br><br><br>Speaking of reflecting back, soul families, there's soul mates, there's twin flames, and how we are this. We're on Earth, but there is also other fractions of us, and that we may be split off, and you know, there's a twin flame somewhere out there, and it might not even be a human, right? But there's another essence, or there's many. I've also heard there's many. So I don't know if on the other side you were able to see whether or not there are sort of really close home frequencies and also maybe your own home frequency within incarnations.<br>Oh, well, we do have our own home frequency. We are who we are beautifully, wonderfully. The idea of twin flame has several different meanings. Some people talk about it as being a romantic soul mate that's most optimal for you. Some people reference it as another incarnation of the same soul, you know, another portion of you. I don't know much about how often that happens. I do know that the soul incarnates and does multiple things at the same time, so it's definitely not off the table. In fact, I think it does happen that the soul has multiple, it can play multiple personalities at once even within the same time period. <br>I have no idea how common that is, but that whole vibration that you are is always you, and then that vibration is more or less resonant with others. In higher systems, there's like a vibrational geography going on. Here on Earth, I mentioned this before, but this is the place where you can put two people in a room, and now they got to be stuck together. They might be discordant and yet they're in a room together. Typically, in higher systems, you go where you vibrate. <br>You go where you resonate with. You are what you are, and you fit over here, and you prefer over here. I'm being general in that, but that still then happens on Earth just in a slower way. So we tend to attract others that we resonate with on some level, whether it be a fear that we're trying to manifest or a deeper soul quality or something else.<br>Yeah, cool. Well, that's good. It's good to know we got some family out there that we're awesome certain frequency that is closer to whatever we are, and look, if that shifts and evolves over time into different frequencies and groups, then so be it. That's what we're here to do, right?<br>Yeah, we are all family actually. There's no such thing as a stranger. Strangers only happen when we have the illusion of separation, and then we don't remember, and we don't feel connected, so we think external people that we have no history with are strangers. That's what we call strangers, but truly, we're all connected. We're all brothers and sisters, every one of us, not just humans but animals, extraterrestrials. It's the same. There's not a big difference between, I know that sounds super crazy because now we're talking about ETS, but the soul has many different opportunities to incarnate, not just human, not just Earth.<br>Earth is precious. It's very unique. I was able to feel and know the incredible unique preciousness of Earth, but it's not the only show in town. It's not the only class you can go to. It's not the only place. There are other systems with incredibly different vibrations, not just in our entire universe, but there are entire other universes available. I mean, this is a huge context. <br>So yes, they're all so multiverse. Yes, a multiverse. So we are brothers and sisters with the other beings that might not be physical either. Like I said, you're not a human. We're not human. We're us. We're you, and you're you, and I'm me. That's what we are. We're just playing human.<br><br><br>Do you think that we'll have true real contact and knowledge and confirmation of extraterrestrials on Earth?<br>Yeah, I think it's inevitable.<br>Have you ever met that? Did you?<br>No, I have no direct experience with what we would call an ET. I do have one memory of what I suspect was probably an intelligent civilization that was not human. I think I have at least one experience in that, but other than that, I've had no direct experiences myself with what we would call ETS. I have interacted at times with other beings, other people's guides or their deeper selves, but I'm going to draw a big distinction. <br>Like I said, it's not really the form, and it's hard to speak to so much of it, but I think you do such an incredible job of being able to articulate, and truly, all you need is really one of these kinds of mystical experiences to be able to hear what you're saying and because you do actually put words to it that resonate. That's why your story is so important and why so many people have paid attention to it is because you're able to put words to it. So I know it's a struggle, but we all appreciate you doing it.<br>Thank you. Just one small comment that it's not that you need to have an experience. I heard you say there that it might trigger an experience. Experiences may happen. I mean, out-of-body experiences are more real than this. They're very real and lucid, but you don't need to have that kind of experience. Who you really are, like, basically follow your intuition. Feel inside yourself. Who are you, and what does your deeper self say is the path toward that? Maybe it's letting go of something. <br>Maybe it's a habit. Maybe it's some self-belief that you need to investigate or some self-worth that you can lift up or whatever. Everybody is unique, so I'm just lifting that up because it doesn't need to be some grand experience. We are spirit having a human experience. <br>That's just what we are. So the question then is, as spirit, because you are spirit right now, as spirit who is in the middle of the play, how do you intuit, how do you feel is the best way to nurture that and to find that here while you're on Earth? You're allowed to do it. There's actually no reason you can't wake up to all that you are here. There's no hard rule against it. Really, yeah, the veil works. It's super effective, but the thing is, this is a stage that we get to use how we choose. <br>It's completely up to us, and if we would like to wake up and go, "Oh my gosh, I'm on a stage. Why is everybody so serious?" We're allowed to do that if we want, or we can lose ourselves in the drama and play some drama for a while. That's fine. That might be a fun little fraction of your experience. They go, "That lifetime was crazy."<br>Well, I mean, I yes, but I also, in some of my experience, one in particular experience on psilocybin, I knew I wasn't human, and I asked when I came back, and I realized because there is so much information in that space. It was like question, answer, question, answer, but simultaneous, almost like telepathy-level speed right where you just, and I go, "I can't." I said, "How am I going to bring this information back to the humans?" And the information and the energy was like, "You don't need to. Just you're fine. Don't worry about it." <br>And then when I wanted to be human, I realized that I had to choose them. I had to choose the mind as the first baseline construct to build this reality, and in the process, I went, "Oh my God, this is why we forget," because in the first space where I knew I wasn't human, I couldn't have been because I was so fully embodied not human that I don't know how I could have been. So I asked the same thing you did. I said, "Can I remember a little? Can I like remember just a little so that I can bring something back?" And so, you know, I guess for whatever it is that I am giving to people as information is like the little I remember.<br>That's beautiful. I love it so much. It makes me so excited. It's like trying to download the entire internet through a landline connection or something. That's gonna happen, and then someone's like, "Here," and they hand you a straw, and they're like, "Okay, now tell us about the ocean." It's like, "Oh, that can't. That's not happening." But the thing is, you are the ocean like right now. You're back. You're back like here you are right. You've collapsed back down. <br>You're folded back down into the limited human mind. You're doing an awesome thing, an awesome job. You're sharing this information. You're being live. You're sharing love. It's beautiful, and now you're here, but the video is still the big you. It never went anywhere. Never shifted. So like that is kind of like widening the straw in a sense, allowing that to flow through and remind others of their oceans.<br>It's like an aperture. Right? Like, you're not ever not the whole thing. That's right, but you just narrow, narrow, narrow, narrow into this very small spectrum, and you go, "This is my aperture." It doesn't mean this isn't there and happening. It's just this is where I'm looking right now. And my experience is that the more spiritual, the more sort of higher vibrational frequency, well, whatever, I don't even know exactly the right words to put to it, is that you just kind of increase the aperture a little bit.<br>Yeah, that's really cool. I love it. It's a great analogy. I just want to comment. So part of increasing the aperture, I think when people talk about that, they think, "Oh, increasing aperture means leaving the physical, leaving all I am as a human." Well, actually, if you, through meditation, if you totally investigate your awareness, what you really are underneath thinking, you create some space through which you see the thoughts for what they are, and then you can actually, with full alertness, be human. Like, actually, "Oh wow, I actually have these thoughts. <br>Oh wow, I actually have this discomfort in my body. Oh wow, I'm actually afraid because I feel old," or whatever it is, whatever the thing is that you're dealing with, processing that widens the aperture. It's not like you're trying to leave all the physical stink. So I'm gonna try to leave. Well, you know, you're never really all the way here anyway, but once you fully integrate what's here, the aperture can't help but widen because now you're no longer limited.<br>There's a metaphor too for this. When my father was a little kid, I mentioned this in the book. He was afraid of a closet in his room when he was going to sleep every night as a child, and every night he would lay there in bed and be terrified of what was in the closet. One night, he's like, "Screw this. I am sick of being afraid of this closet." So he charged into the closet, pushed his way through the clothes, and sat down on the floor, fully expecting to be eaten by the monsters in the closet. <br>He was not eaten by the monsters in the closet, and to this day, my father is not afraid of closets. Now, I know that sounds silly, but our fears are not that dissimilar. We may have difference in scope. We may have had years of abuse or years of pain, whatever, but when you really go into it, when you really go into that dark cloud and say, "All right, I'm ready to get eaten by this monster," there is no monster, and then that aperture expands. It opens because now you've actually gone, processed without even trying, by going and looking and seeing there is nothing to be afraid of. That opens the aperture automatically. It's beautiful.<br>I love that. I love that metaphor. Yeah, that's awesome. Wow. Well, okay, thank you so much. I've taken enough of your time, and I just love the way that you're able to articulate things, and thank you for sharing your story. I'm excited for you, and congratulations on the book. <br>There's so much work, and especially on such a generous book that you have made available if someone really wants to read it, but for most people, I hope they go to Amazon and get it or go buy it on audio because you deserve a little credit for your experience of sharing it and helping. Thank you so much for the opportunity, and thank you for the work you're doing. <br>I think it's fantastic. It's excellent. People who are more known in the mainstream can say, "You know what, this actually is happening because it is real. It's not just woo-woo stuff." So thank you very much for your service and making it available to people and the way that you serve. Thanks for bringing that straw back down and being a straw, being a you know.<br>Well, obviously, I signed up for something to do with this stuff, so I have always actually felt like my career was what it was, but that it was actually just a way to build a platform for this because this feels more important in a way. Yeah, so thank you.<br>Well, thank you so much. Have a wonderful day. Thanks, everybody, for listening to the Pretty Intense Podcast today. I hope you enjoyed it.

 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=-ql9sv8leGc<br>1 OCT 2023<br><br><br>Krista: Hi Christian, welcome to the podcast.<br>Christian: Hi, I'm so glad to be here. Thank you for having me.<br>Krista: Yeah, me too. So, I always like to give my guests the opportunity to introduce themselves in their own words about who they are and what they do. I'll pass it back to you.<br>Christian: Yeah, thank you, Krista. So, my name is Christian Sundberg. My body is 43 years old right now, but I am aware that we are not actually just the human characters that we're playing. Right now, I know that sounds strange to a lot of people, but about 13 years ago, I had an awakening experience where I had taken up a long-term meditation practice, and I began to have out-of-body experiences. I also began to have pre-birth memory return to me, so I remembered a time preceding this life in which I had chosen this life and signed up to experience this. <br>So, while I'm still very much veiled now, that awareness that we are not just this is, you know, right there for me. So, I'm just very motivated to try to reach out to other people and to share because who we really are is just such an amazing, oh, such an amazing message full of so much good news and hope. You know, we're just... there's nothing actually to fear in our lives here. And so, I just feel so motivated to share, you know, some of what I can, even though it's so beyond language, you know, about what we really are, who we really are while we're here on Earth.<br>Krista: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can't wait to unpack your book with you. That's a lot of deep questions. So, I'm always interested in everyone's life journey as in the human experience of religion because I feel like we are evolving away from it, and some of us are evolving into it. But what was your early childhood experience with religion, spirituality, or nothing at all? And then, kind of, where did you find yourself as an adult, and what are you anchoring yourself in these days?<br>Christian: Yeah, thank you. So, I was raised in a household that was primarily Lutheran, so Christian, and I really saw the world through that lens for a long time. I've always been a spiritual seeker, but that was the system that was handed to me and that I understood the world through. I was actually quite devout in my church. I served as an assistant minister for 20 years, and I was on the church council when I became an adult. <br>As a young adult, I was on the church council, and I taught confirmation class, actually. The pastor even asked me to consider going into seminary, so I actually very seriously considered that at the time. Though, even at the time, before my awakening, I kind of sensed that the spirit was bigger than what we could put in a box, so I didn't feel quite comfortable committing myself to a certain belief system even then.<br>But when I went through my awakening journey at the age of 30 and onward, it really meant quite a deconstruction of the belief system that I had up until that point in my life. That took a lot of humility and courage because there were a lot of things that I just hadn't seen or that I had believed incorrectly. And that is okay. You know, that's the nature of how the experience is here. We see out from the beliefs we're handed, and the world reflects back to us the beliefs that we hold. <br>So, I saw the world a certain way through that belief lens. It takes a certain level of awareness and willingness, I think, is probably the right word, to actually call that into question and to begin to actually see the world through a new lens. It can be very challenging to the ego to do that because it's very fear-provoking.<br>So, yeah, so now, at this point, for the last 13 years, I don't feel the need to associate with any specific tradition, though I do enjoy certain traditions. I speak at a Unity Christian Church, and I belong to a Presbyterian Christian church, but I no longer feel the need to identify with any set of form. I'm happy to practice spirituality either through them or not through them on my own. In fact, I feel my relationship with God is stronger than it's ever been, to be honest, even though that word is even... even the word itself is so limiting. It's much bigger than even that word. But yeah, that's a very personal process and something I experience every day.<br><br><br>Krista: Yeah, this deconstruction process is so disorienting, and adding the ego, the fight that you have with your ego, is a real thing, plus all of the domestication and conditioning. I deeply know that process myself. And because there are so many people here on Earth living in the confines of what has been presented to us as the reality of what God is, it's really hard to challenge that. And usually, you become an outcast, and it's so challenging. So, I really appreciate you saying all of that because that's definitely accurate.<br>Christian: You know, it's very much accurate in the sense that we not only are the beliefs handed to us, and we don't know to look any further, but we think that this world and the things in it are all that there is. So, when we take that away, it feels, at least at first, like, "Well, what then is there?" It's like being out at sea without a life raft. You know, the ego really wants to grab onto something. "Please tell me what to believe in so I can feel better," kind of thing. But this process of truly awakening to what we are requires a deep surrender into even that which you don't know. And that can be an actually really beautiful and liberating process because, underneath all the fear, love and peace and joy is what we really are.<br>So, it's okay to explore. It's okay to search and to really call into question and to really explore what we are, explore what life is, and actually accept and fully meet and fully process everything that we experience here, even if that means letting go of certain belief systems and going at it without knowing, like admitting to yourself that you don't know. That can be hard.<br><br><br>Krista: Yeah, I had this experience coming out of my own religious experience where I was very much indoctrinated, and it was very fear-based as well. As I started unraveling everything and really discovering who I was, I realized that there was so much of what we were taught was caught up in this, what I would say, an illusion of certainty, which I know you addressed in your book, and we'll talk about here in just a little bit. <br>But it's funny because what you mentioned there about surrendering that we don't know, it was weird because I had this moment where I was like, "I almost feel better that I don't know everything than saying I know these things for sure." Because saying you know for sure, you can get challenged a lot, and there are a lot of people who don't believe, and there are differing opinions about it, and whatever the case may be. Being able to relinquish that uncertainty was truly liberating in a way that I can't even really describe with my own words. So, it's interesting you hit on that as well.<br>Christian: That's beautiful. Yeah, the uncertainty is genuine to acknowledge. It's authentic to acknowledge it because there's a lot we don't see here. There's a lot we don't know in the physical. But we're in a society where everybody pretty much claims to have everything figured out most of the time when, really, even as a whole species, we have very, very little figured out. So, yeah, it's like, you know, Plato and Socrates, they would say the first step to wisdom is knowing you know nothing. Oh my gosh, yes, it really is true. I mean, you really have to acknowledge, "Wow, I don't understand."<br>And one thing I'll comment on that, though, is that part of the reason that we feel that way is because form itself—that means objects, ideas, thoughts, everything that is based in this local world—is not fundamentally real. It's not the fundamentally real substance. And so, we can't actually find the answers here. <br>One of the reasons we're confused is because we keep looking at the ant. We keep looking at thoughts and forms and books and ideas and this object and this system, and then, "Well, which one? Where are the answers?" That entire thing arises within something much deeper, much faster, much less limited. So, you can't put that much larger context into the small local box. It just doesn't work. It's like not having the right operating system for your technology.<br>Krista: Yeah, it is something like that. It's like being inside of, I don't know, Minecraft, the video game, and you're inside Minecraft, and you're like, "You know, you dig with blocks, and everything is a block world inside a video game, and you say, 'Where in this game is the real world? I don't know. I can't find it.'" Well, you can't possibly express the depth and the richness of our world in Minecraft blocks. <br>Christian: No, similarly, you cannot possibly touch the richness and the vastness of our higher natures or the higher realms with the language that we have, with the belief systems we have, because everything we have here is based in our local system. Even things like linear time and discrete location, these things that seem so obvious to us, they seem like fundamental properties of reality. They're actually not fundamental. Discrete location is actually an illusion.<br><br><br>Krista: Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's... well, we're going to unpack all of that. Okay, let me just take a moment here before we get any further because we could just go on, I think, here. But so, you wrote this beautiful book called A Walk in the Physical, and I feel like I've been looking for this book probably my entire life. So, I'm deeply, deeply indebted to you that you wrote this book because it encapsulates when you go on your spiritual awakening, and you sort of start to understand that there are all of these things you don't know, and it's... and that you do know, which is also another thing we'll unpack here. <br>Yeah, there also is, like, a very... I felt, for myself, a deep sadness in wanting to go home, but like, where is home, right? And you talk about that in the book. And also, a very significant experience that you mentioned earlier of being able to have this pre-birth experience and decide your life. So, let's tell the people real quickly what your book is about. What was its intention, and then what do you hope that it's going to do in the world for people like me and everyone else trying to figure it out?<br>Christian: Thank you. So, my book is called A Walk in the Physical. First, I'll mention that it is available to be read for free online. It's not about money. I'm not just trying to sell it. I want the message to be shared. On the book page of my website, it's available at the third link down. So, A Walk in the Physical... oh, I feel like it's my life's work, actually. I feel it was very important that I kind of actualize it, deliver it in this place. It came to me over a period of six years in chunks. I never once sat down and said, "I'm going to write a book now," or that I'm going to work on my book. That's never how it arrived. It was always like pieces, like inspirational arrivals, and I just recorded them. It took about six years for all the chunks to arrive.<br>The intention of the book is to provide a concise, encouraging framework to help understand what the human experience is within the larger context—like, what are we doing here, what is going on, and who are we really? And that is so beyond language. It becomes extremely difficult to try to present in this format, like we have mentioned. So, I try to do it in a way that's non-linear. I felt that was the way I was called to present it, actually. Like, if I was just going to sit down and write it on my own, I think I would do something a lot more linear. <br>But the way that it's presented is a short section that's only 14 pages long or so that describes, in very concise, structured language, what is the human experience, what are we, what are we doing here, what's the value of this experience, and why do we come? And then, there are 160 essays that are referenced throughout that part one so that, if a given sentence calls to the reader, they can go read about that sentence because spiritual growth is not always linear. Like, we each have a certain idea or a certain encouragement or a certain thought that might help us at a given time. This book is meant to help the reader find that one sentence that is their next piece.<br>And so, there are 160 essays on various topics about what we are and what we're doing here and what the world of form is and why we're using it and how we should consider using it. And then, there's a section in the book, part three, that's question and answer, where I try to speak to all of the standard big questions, which are difficult to put language on. I don't claim to have all the answers. It's not like that, but I have been asked these questions over the years, so I began to record my own answers, and eventually, that helped me to create part three of the book. And they're organized by topic, so if there's a topic that is of interest, you can go right to that topic and just read about that. <br>And then, part four of the book is a meditation exercise and some thoughts on how to relate to your own journey because that is a very personal and unique process. And I find that meditation is a very important part in that process, so I definitely wanted to lift that up in the book as well because, ultimately, this is not about ideas. The book can be helpful because, of course, it's words, it's ideas, but what's more important is your own experience. Yeah, what are you actually experiencing, and how can you actually find and get in touch with who you really are underneath everything that you're not, everything you've associated with, which is not you? So, all the negative self-perceptions and the rich story of this life that seems so deep and convincing—trying to help the reader find, underneath all of that story, who do you sense deep down who you are? And I love that you said before, you know, like, about what we already know. <br>Krista: Oh, yes, yes, that's so important that we seek that out and find that and intuitively feel into it because we all do know, like, deep down. I know that we've all forgotten, even though the veil works, you know. The veil is very effective. It's a very effective consciousness technology, you could say, so we don't remember all of who we are at the human level. That succeeds, but deep down, we all know, like, deep down, we all sense there's a connection missing. There is a love that is just like, "Where is it?" You know, we're always looking for it. <br>We could say, in Christian terms, we're always seeking God all the time. We just don't know it, and we're like, looking for it in this object or this relationship or this process or this activity or, "Show me the next thing that'll stimulate me and try to fill that hole that seems to be missing." But we all know deep down that it's in there, and we all also feel the existing, living connection that we still have with that higher nature. It's not like it's been completely removed. I mean, it feels like it's been removed, but in fact, we're already connected right now, and each one of us, we don't really need an external person. We are, like, deep down, if we follow our own intuition and feel into our own being, there is so much there. And so, this book is about helping the reader to do that.<br>Christian: And it's interesting because when we go on this our own journey and we are liberated from the box of either Western ideology or any other religion that people are brought up in, even if you don't read all the things and you do just sit quietly or go to nature or meditate or empty your mind, what I find as evidence that is so convincing to me is that we have the similar knowing that is already there, and it's deep and deeply embedded in us, and it's about reconnecting into contact with that. <br>And that just makes so much sense to me that we would be having those same experiences, yes, without being told what they are. And that's exactly, yes, yeah, no, exactly. We all have that same internal direction, that same compass, or whatever you want to call it. We all are what we really are. So, it's like you say, when you find that, it is the same. Like, if you go read, I don't know, just like you said, it's not about reading, we know it, but just if you go read, like, I don't know, 10 of the great philosophers or non-duality teachers or spiritual teachers in the world, you will find the similarities. <br>Or if you go read a thousand near-death experiences, people who have died and seen the other side and come back, you will see the similarities. Like, this is a real, this is an objective, I don't know what the right words are, but a shared, consistent foundation that we all come from.<br>Krista: So, yeah, so when, and it's undeniable, yes, it's undeniable. It's undeniable. Now, what's really interesting is that undeniable core. We may all seem to sense it really like a subtle thing at first, okay? But what's really cool—I don't want to stimulate the ego too much here because this can be a super stimulating idea—but if you go down this path far, like, if you really meditate and you really seek out underneath all your fears, in the depth of your awareness.<br>"What am I?" You know, "What am I?" If you really, really explore that and set aside the time and do it consistently and don't settle for any stories, and you're very, you know, what I mean, you're very objective, and you really explore, and you bring to greater and greater alertness, and you meet your own crap and face your own fears, there can be experiences that arise that are not physical, in higher reality systems, for instance, or higher states of consciousness that are so absolutely amazing and blissful and tangible, very tangible, not just, you know, ephemeral, abstract, "Oh, that's kind of nice," not that kind. <br>No, I'm saying like, full, like, more real than this experience, real and lucid. And when you experience that, the realness of the higher context, it becomes utterly self-evident. You know, people say, "Well, how do you know that was a real experience, man?" Like, it's like if you say to somebody, "How do you know you've seen the sky?" Like, how can they convince you? You can't convince somebody you've seen the sky. You just know you've seen the sky. But this is even more real. I can't even describe it. It's just so self-evidently real. <br>So, I'm mentioning that because it starts maybe it might feel like a subtle, deep, distant thing, but in deep exploration, when we're willing to let go of everything we're not, which is the thoughts and the forms and the human association, we may spontaneously discover, "Oh my gosh, this is amazing and real." There are higher reality systems that are so vibrant and rich with color. You could... I don't even know how to describe it. Color that's alive and that you could stare out all day and would just fill you with joy for, you know, or states of being that you know you're not local.<br>And that you can actually feel tangibly that the physical body is occurring within you, not that you are in a physical body. I know it feels like we have been shoved into a physical body, and now we're looking at our eyeballs, you know, I can see out of my head, you know, but no, actually, the body is a set of constraints and definitions that is arising within your consciousness, and there's this beautiful inversion point that can happen when you feel tangibly that the body of your aliveness is so much bigger and not local. So, anyway, I'm just sharing that because this is not like just a subtle woo-woo thing. This is very real, very tangible.<br>Krista: Yeah, it is pretty incredible. I think one time I really scared myself by asking that exact question, not through meditation, but looking in the mirror at my own eyes and looking to see what was behind. It felt like it wasn't physically me. Like, I know I'm me and my physical body and all of the things that are real to this moment, but looking at my eyes and looking at the consciousness that was behind it, I was like, the first time I did it, I scared myself because I could feel what you're talking about, you know, just for a flash of a second, feeling that and being like, "Oh, there's so much more here that I don't understand." Like, that was so early in my journey, and I was like, "God, this is scary. Like, what did I just unlock?" And, you know, it can feel scary. <br>And I think I want to talk to you specifically since we're on this riff here about the individuation of source that you talk about in the book. And to me, when I was reading it, I felt like it spoke to something more profound about how we're trying to connect so deeply with source and one another, almost like if we're trying to put all of the parts back as the whole. And like, we are always all reaching out. We are always seeking God, and it looks different, and it feels different. And so, my question is on the individuation of source. Like, will we ever become the whole again? Do you think?<br>Christian: Well, we are the whole right now. Okay, so that's a loaded question. [Laughter] But I know that it seems on the surface like we're not the whole, really deeply. Like, yes, we've taken the experience of separation really far out on the spectrum here. I mean, we're doing the extreme sport of coming out as far into separation as is possible. We have a gold medal in separation. Like, I mean, other beings would look, and some, I mean, some other beings actually do look at us and say, "Are you crazy? Like, why would you? How could you even do that? How could you even engage an experience where you actually feel separate from everybody else? That's ridiculous. Why would you do that?" <br>Oh, so we're doing that now, right now. Like, we're in it. We can't... we made it. So, the question is being asked from the perspective of this really deep, apparent separation, while the truth of our nature is always connected. We never actually get separated. That's an important assumption to point out because even assuming that you're separated automatically is your consciousness buying into a perception that's not in alignment with the truth. Not super helpful.<br>So, if we start with, "Okay, wait, maybe I really am connected to everything," you know what I mean? And then see, and you start to see all of those connections. Yes, they express even all the way out here. What I mean by "out here" is even out here where the limitation set is so extreme in the physical because we really are in a very alien state and an extremely dense, high limitation state of being right now. It's like crazy. It's like going to Mount Everest, and you're like, "Wow, it's cold. <br>There's no air up here." We got a gold medal in density too. That's it. Well, that's what this is. That's what this experience is. It's that. So, now that we're here in the density, yes, we are seeking to rediscover, in part, I mean, in part of what we're doing here is we're seeking to rediscover that connectedness that never left, to reawaken to who we are even from here because if we can do it from here, like, while we're at this point of extreme separation, it is like an expansion of the knowing of the being all the way out to this degree. You see, the contrast is like a creative tool. So, we do seek to actually experientially find who we really are, to wake up from the dream while we're in the dream because it's fun to do that, and because if you can do that here, even when you're out on the mountain, it's like, "Holy cow, that is some awesome and powerful stuff."<br>Krista: Yeah, I think it's just so interesting that that separation feels so real. I mean, I know I felt it for so long, and it wasn't until I got real far into my journey that I found it in nature the quickest. Like, when I am feeling very separate or alone or disconnected, yeah, and usually, I think, you know, most people might say that disconnection is really the disconnection to ourself and everything we are, right? Yes, but when I go into nature, like, I am immediately, it's like clicking in. It's like being sat down into like a spaceship and going, it's just immediate for me, and I remember vibrationally closer to who we really are again because nature is in a state of acceptance. It just exists. It's just alive. It's just being and presenting itself, and we vibrationally feel that without even knowing it. <br>Yeah, like we come into this vibration. We see it. We hear it. We smell it. We're in the presence of it physically, and that vibration of acceptance automatically moves us closer to who we really are, a little bit, just a bit, but enough that we feel it, and enough that we feel the ease, you know, immediately. Yeah, because spirit, our true nature, is ease and joy and peace and love, but it's just that we've gotten so deeply associated into what we're not, you know, the human story, the forms, the negative self-perceptions, like, "Oh my gosh, I'm unworthy of love," or whatever it is that my parent taught me when I was three, and I'm holding on to it, or, "Oh man, you know, I lost my job. I must be shameful," or, "I can't pay the bill, so I have no power," you know, whatever the negative perceptions are that we think are so real.<br>Our association into that is the separator. Like, the veil permits an obscuring so that we don't remember, but it's our association into the form that makes it so real, whereas, like, babies, you know, small kids, they've come in. They're not so deeply associated yet, so they just come and go, you know, like, there, they feel it, but then we tell them 200 times, "Oh, your name is this, and you need to do this," and they're like, "Oh, okay," and then now that's their care. Now that's who they are, right? And their identity builds, and all the things, yeah, all the way till now.<br>Christian: Yeah, I will... I love that you brought up the acceptance thing because this was one of my questions too, and definitely, I think, key curriculum on the spiritual and human experience is getting to a place of radical acceptance about everything. But in your book, specifically, you call out accepting what it is. So, when you talk about that in your book, what does that actually mean for somebody reading it and trying to understand that concept and how it can help them on their journey?<br><br><br>Christian: Yes, excellent. So, what it means is exactly how things are right now, what how your life has arrived to you, your circumstances. So, that's the external, and the internal too, your feelings and your body, the feelings in your body, the state of your body, the thoughts that you're putting on the state of your body, and the state of your life, everything, the whole thing, all of all the form. <br>All that that I just described is form. It just means distinctions of some kind that have arisen within the metaphorical soup of consciousness. You've lost yourself into these forms, okay? So, the reason that acceptance is so powerful is that rejection is done out of fear, and fear only occurs when we buy into a self-perception that's not in alignment with the truth.<br>So, when we stop rejecting everything, even things exactly as they've arisen, and we actually say, "You know what? I accept this. I'm present with it. This is how it is. It's okay. I'm here now. I'm fully alert. I'm awake here with exactly how things are," that acceptance automatically opens the channel and moves you vibrationally closer to who we really are because life itself is accepting. <br>Like, you could say that source is unconditionally loving. That's like a fundamental, and we'll use the word quality, but it's the nature of source. It's unconditionally living, and unconditional love is completely accepting, utterly accepting. It doesn't reject. It doesn't kick out or push away. It's not how it works. So, where are we rejecting and pushing away? "Oh no, but there's these bad things in my life. You know, there's these pains. <br>There's these limitations. There's these terrors. This person left me, or this person abused me, or I have this disability. I reject that." You know, that's what we do. Well, if we decide to put down the false power of rejection because raising the mighty fist of the ego might work in the short term, but it's not true power. If we put that down and actually fully accept this moment exactly as it is arisen, true strength, true power, true life can rise up and flow through us, and all of a sudden, we can find joy and peace and freedom. It can be present even now, even in exactly this circumstance, and then we're in power to change it even if we wish. <br>We do that. We see we can do that from a place not of rejection but from a place of love and peace. You know, we don't have to lose our peace even as we take action to help our world and help those around us. Acceptance doesn't mean inaction or inactivity. It's a state of being. It's a state of relationship to the circumstance and a relationship to the meaning we've put on it.<br>Krista: Yeah, I think it's just such a powerful and alchemical thing to apply in your daily life and then everywhere. And I find it so freeing to be able to accept things as they are. On my journey, in particular, I had a really negative inner dialogue, which you do talk about a little bit in the book, and it was one of the things that really created a lot of obstacles for me that weren't obviously real but created psychological obstacles, let's say. And being able to accept that maybe I wasn't the right or not the right—that's not the right reason—that I didn't accept in those moments that I could be lovable because I had flaws that I couldn't reconcile or because I had baggage that I was hanging on to or things that hurt me that would make me feel like I wasn't enough. You know, I think all this is a common struggle in our human experience. <br>Sure, everyone goes through this at some point. And for me, I came through acceptance in the lineage of my practices and education and Buddhism. That's where I first came into contact with it. Removing that judgment, which you also talk about in the book a lot, allowed such a deep acceptance of where I was and loving the flaws so that I could love the future part of me that was reconciled to all of that. And I just find it so important to be able to do that. I feel like it's so liberating, and it does create this peace and ease that you're talking about. I wish everyone could feel that.<br><br><br>Christian: Yes, no, absolutely. That's really beautiful. One comment I'll make—I didn't mean to imply that that process you just described is easy. It can be easy, of course, but the reason I mention that is because fear, which is at the root of all this rejection and ego stuff that's going on, it's just fear. Fear can be hard. Fear is like the worst. It is the worst. No, no, absolutely. In fact, I mean, really, it's the only real problem. I mean, there's not even a real problem. <br>It perpetuates, yeah, fear and ignorance are the only two real issues that we have here on Earth. Everything else arises from that. Everything arises from that. Yeah, so the reason I'm pointing that out is because that does... what you just described, okay, you notice you have an inner dialogue saying you're worthless or this certain quality about you isn't good. It takes humility and bravery to look at that and go, "Oh crap, I really do feel that way. That hurts. That really hurts. I'm afraid. Oh my gosh, I'm afraid." And then you feel small because, "Oh my gosh, I'm afraid," you know, and "I have no power." Okay, so this may sound like a tangent, but I just feel nudged that I should mention it. <br>So, when I first went to... so, I had a very traumatic experience when I was 22, and I had post-traumatic stress after this. This was part of what I signed up to experience. I didn't know it at the time. At the time, I was only deeply traumatized, but I went through years of counseling. And when I first walked into my counselor's office, onto the literal and proverbial couch, to sit down on the couch for counseling, behind her, written on a chalkboard, was a sentence that, at the time, it just pissed me off. It just stimulated my ego. And the sentence was, "Power lies in accepting powerlessness." I thought, "That's BS. There's no... that's... <br>I automatically was like, 'Boy, that's the biggest BS I ever heard.'" However, I have subsequently discovered that it is very much literally true, like very, very tangibly spiritually true, because we already feel the powerlessness. You see, the ego does everything it can to try to convince us we don't. "Oh no, no, I'm going to tell myself this new story," or, "Oh no, look, I have value because I have money in my bank account," or, "Look, I have value because I belong to this group, and this group's good, and that group's bad, and so now my group's better than yours, and now I got that solved." That all doesn't really work. Underneath it all, you really have, you know, if we really have that powerlessness feeling or whatever it is, confronting that inner dialogue means acknowledging that actual negative self-perception that's causing fear, that's stimulating fear at the root, and that's hard. But what I want to point at it though is power lies in accepting the powerlessness. <br>So, accepting the fact, "Oh, I actually feel powerless," or, "I actually feel shameful. I'm not worthy of love," or, "I actually feel ugly," or whatever, whatever the thing is. When we actually go into that dark closet, like all the way, like push our way through the clothes, as it were, you know, and feel it—I use that metaphor a lot of times, but it's a great metaphor—when we actually go in there and explore that and actually feel that into it and smell the mothballs and we're like, "Wow, I got a lot of mothballs in here. How do I didn't even know I had 100 mothballs in this closet. They're terrible." When we really do that all the way, there's this really beautiful thing that happens, not because we're trying, but by actually going in and acknowledging how we feel. And yes, that may mean lots of tears. It may mean gut-wrenching, body-racking tears. <br>That's fine. That's okay. You're here to experience and to process that crap. Once you really, really process, you find it vanishes because now you went in and faced it instead of running away from it your whole life anymore. And once you face it and process it, it vanishes, and now the only thing that's left is what you already always were, which is peace and love and joy. And in fact, the peace and the love and the joy is actually expanded now because now you know what it's like to actually have been powerless and yet rediscover that you really are powerful. Yes, that expansion, yes, and you have that forever. Like, after the human experience is over, you retain that forever. Like, "Oh no, no, I know what it's like. I was there, man. I know what it's like to feel powerless, and I processed it. I meant it. I climbed that mountain." Wow, that's powerful work. That's what we're here to do. It's beautiful.<br>Krista: It is beautiful, man. I am literally telling people that all the time because when you go on the healing experience too, there are two things that are so true for everyone. It's that one, we want to just ignore and sweep everything under the rug because that feels easier, and number two, that there's this idea that if we confront the things that get in the way from us having a deep connection with ourselves and others or source—and I think all of us are calling out for that connection—that if we address it, it's somehow harder, but actually, it may... it does every time. You're just letting go of everything, so you become lighter. You have more space. <br>You have more expansiveness, more openness. All of the love that you ever wanted to feel starts to emanate from yourself out to the world, and you're literally, figuratively, and literally lighter. And you know, you can verbalize this, and like you said in your book, sometimes language doesn't even do us any favors here. It's not even... we can't capture what it is right, even you and I trying to say and point to what this is. You have to experience it because the words are not complete here for what that is.<br>Christian: Absolutely. I think that everybody's listening though, who is listening, has that intuitive sense though, and we all seek that, like that peace, that joy. We're like, "Oh my gosh, we might think, 'I've been missing it my whole life,'" but you still know deep down in there. You still know. Like, you may have rejected it your whole life, and you may have been proven to you six thousand times that you are shameful, but underneath it all, you still know that you are precious and important. It's in there. It's because it's true. It's the reality.<br>Krista: Yeah, gosh, so good. I think I probably should have mentioned something earlier, maybe asked you about it early in the interview, but here we are. So, you keep alluding to something called the veil, and people that maybe haven't read your book yet that are watching this interview, let's explain to them what you actually mean by that, and then, you know, maybe you can also tell us a little bit too about choosing your life and the situations you had, and a little bit about that part of the book because it's so fascinating to me.<br>Christian: Sure, yeah. So, you know, the veil is a broad term that everybody kind of uses a little bit differently, but when I speak to it, I mean a specific thing—a set of limitations that we wear in order to have the incarnative physical experience. So, think of it this way: your consciousness right now, it pre-existed the human experience. We don't remember that, you know, because that's what the veil enables. It's that you don't have conscious access to before the human experience. It seems like all you've ever been is a human. <br>Man, that's alien. Anyway, the veil is the set of constraints that your consciousness is presented with, like a cloak that you have to surrender to. And the reason is, you have to buy into it. We have to buy into it because the soul is sovereign. What I mean is, it's a piece of source. There's no greater authority, you could say, that you're a fragment of God. So, what can lock God away into an experience where it doesn't know itself anymore? The only thing that can do that is God, like yourself. The only thing that can do it is your own surrender. There's no other power.<br>So, in my experience, okay, so in very brief, I worked with my guides. They presented this life to me. I reviewed this life in incredible detail with all the millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold, what it would be like to experience being Christian. <br>And I made certain requests, and I understood certain things about the body and the parents and the context, and I knew that I would experience, very likely, a trauma in my 20s that would give me a chance to re-engage a fear. My main purpose in coming was to process this certain very, very low vibration that had bested me in a previous experience. And okay, so after I had reviewed everything there, I—this is a longer story I've shared many times—but getting right to it, when I was right about to actually incarnate, I was in this area that can only be described as like a mechanic shop or a technician's chamber, and there were these technical guides there. I don't know how to describe them, but their nature is like mechanical, and I like to call them tinkers. <br>They're beings who are extremely skilled at veil application. I know this sounds wild, but the thing is, the soul is very, very complex, and the physical experience and the context and the body and everything that's going on with the life is very complex. So, they have to do this thing in order for there to be an effective veiling over so powerful a being because the soul is so powerful. So, in order for the subset of the soul, the personality portion of the soul, to be veiled, there has to be a surrender into this cloak, like I described. <br>So, I remember being in this room—I describe it as a room, and it's not really a room, but it's like a room over the Earth—and these beings presenting to me the veil and saying, "One last time, are you sure? Are you sure you want to do this?" And I said, "Yes." And then I remember this plummet in vibration, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more lower still, and then, like, when you feel like you're at the bottom you could possibly go, going more lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, and having all of my knowing be cut off and all of my connectedness disappear, and suddenly being... it felt like being shoved inside of a tuna can, like a tiny metal can, and yet so being super dense but also super like empty, like the vacuum of space. And it was so, so uncomfortable. And so, the veil is that set of constraints that I surrendered to. Like, in this case, in this life, I focused on not fighting off the veil because I had done that in a previous experience out of fear. After right after I had incarnated, I was still in the womb, and I rejected the limitations because they triggered my fear immediately. I was like, "I'm not doing this. There's no... this is insane. I'm not doing this. No way." So, but this time, I just focused on not fighting it. Eventually, I did end up, however, deciding, "I'm not doing this once again." <br>So, I was like, "I'm not tolerating this for a lifetime. This is not happening." And in that case, I had this very profound personal experience that is just so beyond language where... oh, the only words are the great "I Am" presence of God, source itself, came to me and expanded me back out, and I felt all of the universe within me. I felt the sun, the sun of Earth, churning. It was conscious. It had a consciousness to it. I know that sounds crazy, but I knew it. I could feel it in me, and it was alive, and it had like a raging bliss to it. And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." So, I stopped fighting and surrendered back into the state of being bodily in the womb, and the next thing I remember is a long time later. I remember being physically born the day of my birth. <br>So, that's just a super quick, high level, but so that's the veil. It's that set of limitations that we wear, and even now, I can feel the veil on me. I'm not fighting it. It's cool. It's present, but it's like in the police shows, the cop shows, you know, where someone's in an interrogation room, and they like, there's like a one-way glass wall, and the police officers can see the person being interrogated, but you can't see out. That's what it feels like to me. Like, I can't see out. Well, I know I have these certain memories, but overall, I'm very much veiled.<br>I can't see past the glass, but I can see the glass in my consciousness, and I'm just like, "Oh man, like, you know..." Anyway, I know it's an opportunity, so I can feel it. I'm wearing it. We're all wearing that veil right now. It is metaphorically like being given a weight, like a heavy coat that we wear on and in our consciousness so that we can operate from this extremely high-value, unique, utterly super dense and separate-feeling perspective of being human. There's so much opportunity in that. In fact, even just being given to human life is like winning the lottery. It's like so valuable.<br>Krista: Yeah, I know that, you know, people that might be coming into contact with this concept of the veil might not understand it because they haven't read your book or have just never heard this before. But what you said back there about that feeling of that first incarnation where you're like, "I was about to say a bad word," yeah, that's pretty much what it was, but like, I have deeply felt that too. <br>I also have two family members who left this place through suicide, and I deeply understand that that was at the core of what they were feeling. And so, you can imagine, without understanding the veil, the concept of knowing we're not this physical body, this 3D world, and that sometimes is really painful, especially because we are this sacred soul in this experience, and because we do, and we don't have the knowledge, you know, simultaneously, it causes so much internal turmoil. And I think, as a seeker, you know, that's what we're trying to do. <br>We're trying to come closer and at peace to all of these things, to try to reckon. I know, for me, I'll just speak for myself, like, that's what I was trying to do. I was trying to reconcile, like you said, this walk in the physical against what I knew spiritually to be true.<br>Christian: Yeah, I know that's a really excellent point. So, being veiled seems to... I was going to say create a big problem, but it didn't actually create a big problem. It's actually an opportunity. It seems to have created, however, a big problem, a huge problem, and that huge problem that it seems to have created is separation. And that's the separation from each other, separation from source, separation from our knowing, from all of our memory, all of our knowing of who we are. Now, it seems like it's... I mean, it's very effective at doing that, practically speaking, but it's just...<br>I'm just qualifying it because our true nature is always on the other side. I know that's not satisfying to the separate personality who's like, "No way, I'm pissed," but I'm just pointing it out because the deeper part of us is always connected and is... we're like, we're on the other side right now. We don't actually have to go anywhere. But yes, like you said, there is this huge problem now, and the price of coming to be human is the pain of that separation, and it's a big pain. <br>There's nothing that hurts more really than losing all of what we are. In fact, even I... I heard, I think it was Natalie Sudman, the near-death experiencer, I think it was her—I could be wrong—say something like, "Even one day on Earth, even just living one day on Earth, is such an accomplishment." I agree with that 100%. Even just going and eating your breakfast and going to work and dealing with your own internal dialogue, you know what I mean? <br>Like, even just going through those things that seem very day-to-day and routine for us from this perspective is huge. It's no small feat. It's not a small feat. So, then, I get a lot of emails from people, and sometimes people say, "Oh my gosh, this is really hard," and I'm paraphrasing, and it's like, "Yes, yeah, it's really hard, but here now." But here's the thing though: now, what do you do with it? That's the key. It's not about how hard it is. It's like if someone puts 100 pounds over you, and you're like, "This is heavy," okay, but now you have a choice: do you lift the weight or not? <br>And in this metaphor, not lifting the weight is running away. Well, it's all the fear. It's all the ego, all the rejection, and not owning our own crap. That's not lifting the weight. Lifting the weight is when we turn around and go, "Oh my gosh, I feel like a scary little child, and I don't know anything," and then I could lift this and get really strong muscles. No, but no, what I mean is by acknowledging the limitation and the fear, that is lifting the weight. So, lifting the weight is making choices that are aligned with love rather than fear and all the things that come in, and there's a million and ten things that that can mean, choosing love rather than fear. So, we have not... it's not just a price. It's not just a great cost. It's not just a huge problem. No, we have an incredible opportunity, and this is one of the things that motivates me so much about sharing this message. <br>This is a huge opportunity. We can and should use it while we're here and not just cry and reject it. It's okay if we feel horror or pain, but now that it's been... now that this contrast has been offered to us, what do we do with it? Because if you can lift a hundred pounds even a little bit, you're doing way more than is possible with metaphorically a half a pound. I'm just using this simple, silly metaphor. Yeah, well, all I mean is in the higher reality systems where the constraints are much less dense, it's easy to say, "Oh, I'm kind, and I'm free," but do you really know? Do you really... you know what I mean? <br>Do you really know? If you come here and you can find your own strength, find your own love that is there for you, find your own love, love the person next to you even when you've had a bad day, smile at the person in the store and make their day better, like, every time we choose that, we are helping the whole, and we are lifting the weight, and we are helping love to expand. It's an incredible service we're providing, and that service doesn't need to be a heavy-hearted one at all. No, no, our true nature is joy. So, the more and more we align with love, the more and more joyful our life becomes, and then what's so amazing is now we're within this highly veiled, dense experience, and we find, "Oh my gosh, this can be bliss even here." The bliss of our nature is deeper than this, and actually, we can use it and enjoy it in a way that's so unique. <br>Like, just a super simple example: one time I was out of body, and I was curious if I could taste something, so I manifested a vat of peanut butter frosting, and I tasted this peanut butter frosting, and it was the best-tasting peanut butter frosting that that peanut butter frosting could ever taste like for me. However, it lacked a surprise novelty. What I mean is, it wasn't surprising. It was like a recording of the best flavor of peanut butter, whereas here, if I put food in my mouth, I will be surprised by sensations that arrive. So, that's a very just... such a very simple, normal example. I'm just pointing out that our physical world is full of beautiful sensory opportunities and experiential opportunities, social opportunities, cognitive opportunities that just don't exist in much less limiting systems. And when we integrate those experiences, we learn and we grow in a way that stays with us far past the end of even our physical death. It's a beautiful opportunity.<br>Krista: Oh, I think the alchemical process of transmuting your pain and suffering into wisdom, into usefulness, into clarity, into kindness, is joy, all the things. I feel like it's almost one of the highest things we can do here on Earth. And what I noticed for myself, as I got further and further into alchemy and stopped injuring myself, I stopped injuring the outside world, and then I didn't...<br>I wasn't experiencing things at the frequency, like, you know, I would say bad experiences, you know, two decades ago, that where I would run into, and you just realized that, you know, going down that alchemical journey of being able to have the courage to face the things that we come in here, you know, whether we choose that suffering... you know, people have different ideas about this, but you know, I think we do, you know, I think we choose suffering consciously and unconsciously, and then being able to say, at some point in your life journey, like, "What is this trying to teach me, and how can I allow it to change me into a higher version of myself?" is so perfect, such a profound experience to have in this form.<br>Christian: Yes, so, fear, like we mentioned earlier, fear is hell, and so, what I mean is, if you have fear, you're going to have a negative experience. And when I say your fear, that means you have ego-driven fear. So, if you live a life that is self-serving and rejecting your own issues and not taking ownership for your life and just trying to get the things that you think are going to stimulate you today, you won't actually be deeply happy in the long run because we're love. <br>Our true nature is love. Love is joy, and love are synonymous. So, what I mean by that is, you can just look at the quality of your own life and say, "Am I living a joyful life or not?" And if you're not living a joyful life, it's okay. It's okay to acknowledge and say, "Oh wow, maybe I have some fear and some rejection that is there." So, that's a part of the alchemical process. <br>So, basically, I'm saying it's not like signing up for suffering. It's not like... the wording is careful here. It's not like we sign up to suffer. It's that we sign up to experience contrast and limitation, yeah, that might provoke our fear, and fear is suffering, okay? Yeah, but it doesn't necessarily have to be suffering. No, it never has to be suffering. It's our own rejection that hurts. Even pain, if you have like a headache or something or if you're vomiting or whatever, whatever the negative sensation—like, a few years ago, my gallbladder failed me, and I had to have it removed, and I spent six weeks like wandering around crying because it hurt so bad. I lost all this weight, and I was just a big mess. But that sensation, it was like, I noticed, yeah, it was really, really painful, but was it charged? No, it's just pain. It's just a sensation arriving within my experience. I get to do whatever I want with it. <br>And when the time came to get operated on, I used to be very afraid, like, years ago, of surrendering to anesthesia, as an example, but I chose to walk up, get on the operating table with full alertness, and not reject it. You know, use that experience. That's alchemical. It's alchemy because it's like the context is neutral. It's not negative. It's just something that may be very extremely triggering for your fear. So, then, face your fear. Use the opportunity. Use the trigger to face and process your fear, and then you won't be afraid anymore, and love and joy are what remain. That transmutation is synonymous with the expansion of consciousness. That's what we're here to do. It's beautiful. So, anytime there's something negative, it's like a messenger. It's like, "Oh, wait, time out. I feel negative. Why do I feel negative?" <br>And you go, "See," and you'll find usually there's like a little message at your door saying something like, "I feel powerless because I blah blah blah," whatever the story is, and then, "Okay, why that?" And then you seek down and over the root, you're going to find a fear. So, you can always trace whatever is in the present moment down to whether or not you're fully accepting or rejecting something in your experience. And that process of then switching from rejection to acceptance and actually feeling and owning who you are and becoming more alert, more present instead of less present, owning that process, oh my gosh, there's so much powerful alchemy that takes place. It can be a very physical process too. It can happen in your body. <br>Like, I knew so over years and years of dealing with the trauma that I experienced at 22, I've had more chronic health conditions than I care to share, but I've healed so much because I didn't know it, but my body was acting as like a soundboard for all this deep buried crap that I had down in there. And so, the healing that I went through by the alchemy—I like that word—the alchemy that I went through in consciousness had a very physical element to it, very strong feelings, you know, during the fear and the negative, it was very physical, and yet during the releases and the expansions, very physical bliss and an increase in life force, actually, and in health. It's really interesting. The body is like such an important tool and a part of that process.<br>Krista: That's really fascinating to think about it like that, that analogy of the soundboard is really interesting to me. We're getting close to the end. I do want to ask you just one more question about the book here. There were two words that I made in bold letters when I sent you my pitch email to come on here, which was love and intention, and I felt like those were getting volleyed throughout your text. And you hear this a lot, I think, everywhere in our consciousness about love, and I think, to me, I haven't heard it described so succinctly as the way you described it, like what it is, how we are supposed to be—or not, I guess, supposed to be is not a great word—but like how we should be growing into love with one another and ourselves and how this is so important, and the intention we're putting behind in our shared experience of humanity. I wondered what you had to say about those two things in general for the listening audience: love and intention.<br><br><br>Christian: Love and intention, yeah, yeah. So, this is really hard to describe and talk about because we have like five words, you know, we use the word love. This is way... it's just like it's just like God. It's not... it doesn't matter. It doesn't do justice, but love is the closest word we have. Love is okay. So, love, we could say, is synonymous with our true nature. <br>And so, one of the main things we're here to do is to wield an intention, that means the actual why behind our choices, the actual one, not the why we're necessarily telling ourselves on the surface, the actual deepest why, to align that why with love rather than fear, rather than rejection, because love is in alignment with the unity of being, whereas fear only can arise as we buy into the illusion of separation and the negative self-perceptions that that triggers. Fear can only respond in that which is only a rise in that which is non-native. <br>So, acting out of ego is acting in alignment with the illusion that we're not, whereas love is acting in alignment with that which has the true lasting power, the true bliss, and the joy and the freedom of our being. So, what does that mean, you know, in our... I'm careful to try to put too many specific labels on what a loving choice means because it can mean so many different things.<br>I do try to describe it throughout the book in various ways because our intuition will always guide us better than any words. But love can mean all sorts of things. It can mean compassion, kindness, bravery, strength, surrender, action, discipline, stepping back. You know, it can mean... there's just so many things, but the question is, what is that quality of the why? You see, it's not the behavior on the surface, and it's not even technically the outcome of the action on the surface. It's the why. It's the intention that matters. Like, if you truly intend to do good, truly intend, that's what matters, even if that true intention may produce an outcome that is sub-optimal for someone. That's secondary. When we mobilize loving intention, the world tends to heal and become wonderful. We tend to brighten each other and enliven each other and just empower each other in a way that otherwise we can't. <br>So, and I'll say one last thing about love. So, you could think of it, and let love, loving intention, meaning two things: one is a quality of virtue in any given direction. So, take like bravery, to stand up and do something when it's hard versus being able to stand back and let something happen or to accept without action without losing our peace or something. You know, any axis we can come up with, it can mean in either of those directions. So, it could mean like, for instance, humility and confidence. Those two things don't need to be conflicting. Can we know humility, truly, and can we know the strength of our own being and that we have nothing to fear and there's never a reason not to be confident? <br>Can we know both of these things? So, there's many, many different axes that we might exercise choice-making through, many, many different axes, and so that's one... that's one area that love learns both, like it's like refining virtues, you could say, in all these different directions. And the other thing that love does is grow in wisdom, and that means deciding which to implement, which choice to make, which end of the spectrum to wield in this context today. And that is also really important because that means you have to look at your action and say, like, let's say you're in a public place, someone is doing something mean to someone else, so now you have a choice: do I intervene? Is it appropriate to intervene? And then you can immediately, in a quick second, make a decision. And then you find in yourself, "What is the quality with which I'm making this decision?" <br>So, many times, we may be called compelled to step forward and say something. Maybe it's a mother who's treating their child poorly and hurting them or something, and you step forward and say something gentle like, "I don't know, this child is a loving child," you know, just remind them of love in some way, and then they might say, "Oh, it's not your business." That's okay. Maybe you're called to step in and intervene. Maybe it's a situation though where you see something happening, and it's best for you not to step in. That discernment rather than ego because the ego... oh no, it's way easier for you not to do anything, or, "Oh no, don't, I don't want to look stupid." I'm not talking. I'm saying love means deciding the former rather than the latter, like basically listening to the heart and listening to the spirit and living fearlessly, basically. So, yeah, both of those are really important, and that is basically the name of the game because if we really do that, we find it's not about the product of our actions. It's not about moving the objects around on the stage today.<br>It's about your relationship to the present moment, your relationship to life itself. Are you living in joy and freedom today? Are you loving the person next to you today? That's all. That's where the power is. You see, like, we think on the physical, "Oh, that's not accomplishing much." No, no, when you actually process your fear and you actually choose love, the whole collective consciousness of humanity hears it because we're like a big pond in consciousness space, and you're like a light going off, and then everybody else, maybe they may not be able to consciously identify it, but their being can see. And I'll just say, not to again not to stimulate the ego, but in thought-responsive reality layers, you can see it. <br>Thoughts can be seen and heard and felt. They're all... they're like things. So, in the pond of the human collective consciousness, when one person wakes up and chooses joy and chooses freedom even when it's hard, that gives permission to thousands of other people because the temperature of the water shifts up, and now, so all... so you don't have to worry about everything. You just choose the way that you relate to life, and then when you do that, you do raise the temperature of the water. You do help all of humanity, even if you're behind closed doors. No one has to even be able to see you. You can still just by appreciating a houseplant in the sunlight in the morning, if you really feel that and you bring that love into that moment just for a moment, not artificially, just genuine, you just appreciate it, then you have just touched all of humanity.<br>Krista: Well, that's beautiful. I love what you said back there too about regardless of what the outcome is, having the intention coming in with love, that that's what's important because I think sometimes we can also have that like analysis paralysis when we want to intervene or we want to help or we want to provide a moment of nurturing or support or whatever, all of the examples you used right now. And sometimes we can get caught in that pull-push and pull of ourselves like, "Should I?" And I think if the answer is, "Am I doing this from a place of love, genuine love?" then I'm going to move forward, and whatever the outcome is is not important, but I'm doing this intently with deep, unabiding love for humanity, this person, yeah, this animal, whatever it might be.<br>Christian: One comment I'll make to that: the intellect is in service to intention. So, what I mean is, all the learned ideas, all the understanding that you have, that's what your consciousness utilizes and works through. Intention shines through the intellectual choice. So, that might mean that a lot of analysis, that might mean that a lot of analysis can be useful in a given choice, perhaps, but many times, analysis paralysis also could be ego because we're afraid of doing the wrong thing. We're afraid of having some outcome happen. Usually, the heart knows pretty darn quick. I don't just mean the heart like just the heart. I mean, usually, our being because the soul... <br>I don't get too much down this path because I know we're running out of time, but the higher portion of ourselves has really good vantage point. It can see everything, sees a landscape really clearly and quickly, immediately, very quick. So, then, we're on the path, and we're like, "Which way do we go? Do I go down this path or I go down this path?" And the soul says, "Take a left into the woods," and you're like, "What?" Because it can seem much better than you, and that is an immediate thing. It doesn't take analysis paralysis. You just know. So, I'm just highlighting those two things. You know, yes, you may need a lot of intellectual deliberation for a choice, but the deeper being is very immediately communicative, and we know. Like, we know. It's instinctual. <br>Yeah, yeah, it's like, and it's deeper even than biological, physical instinct. It's spiritual knowing, and we know in circumstances. We just know. Like, and it's like, you might do something or choose something that appears so small on the physical surface. It might be the smallest thing in the world, but you just knew that it was like, maybe you just decided to sit down for 10 seconds and be instead of, like, maybe you're walking out of a Chipotle with your dinner in hand, you're ready to get in your car and drive home with extra guac, and you just feel like you want to sit down for 10 seconds, so you do. <br>You sit down, and you just experience for a few moments. That could be it. It doesn't matter what's the physical outcome. What I'm saying is, if that is the direction of love, then it's beautiful, and it serves it, and maybe you affected others. Maybe the traffic ended up differently than you could have otherwise seen. You don't know, or maybe there was no physical outcome, but you just took a step towards joy and freedom. See, basically, fun, even fun, fun and joy and freedom, like that, it's a service when we choose that.<br>Krista: Yeah, well, and I think it ties into the whole conversation, so we can wrap it up here, I guess. But it calls to the idea that we are all connected, so when we're making these conscious decisions with intention and love, and all of it's happening in the physical world, but there's non-physical outcomes that shift everything. And so, that's why we can continue on this path unafraid, telling our ego to back it up and just living into the knowingness and trying to pull up the veil a little bit every time.<br>Christian: Yeah, absolutely. One comment to that: the yeah, I'm not discounting the meaning and the depth and the importance of the physical. It's a big play. Okay, it's not even real fundamentally. It's like a big shared dream environment. So, we are very... we tend to, which is so wild to even fathom, it's very normal though from the higher vantage point. It's very... it becomes ridiculously obvious. <br>I'm just saying that because we get really concerned, "How much money do I have today?" or, "What am I going to do if this certain physical thing happens?" or, "What if I can't do this certain physical thing?" Okay, the quality of intention is what matters because what lasts past the physical and what always existed is you, your consciousness itself, your spirit, and what we're quote-unquote learning is that quality of intention, not the moving of objects. We can create any objects we want. We're powerful beings, but here in the physical is where we experience lack and limitation and linear time and all these things. <br>So, but that stuff is all not fundamental. What is fundamental is you and your ability to wield an intention to make choices that is in alignment with love or fear. And so, that's why those small things... another reason those small things are so important because when you choose love, that is the success. It doesn't matter. It's not about how we've rearranged the objects today. We are loving beings, so when we can bring love even to where there apparently is not love, that is the success already. We're done. Done. Whatever you done. Okay, actually, no, it's not done yet. Where can everyone connect with you on social media, your website? Like, where are you hanging out?<br>Christian: Um, it's awalkinthephysical.com. There's a book page there. I have a bunch of talks and interviews there. And you can also reach out to me by email. I apologize if I can't respond right away. Sometimes I get a lot of emails, but <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com</a> is my email address. And the book is available on Amazon or on Audible as an audiobook.<br>Krista: I bought both versions because I wanted to hear you read it while I had it in front of me.<br>Christian: I'm glad that works. Yeah, it was like extra learning for me to make it all stick, basically. So, I want to end in some gratitude, and I'm really curious about what three things you're grateful for in this moment or this week, this year, whatever it's like, whatever's in your heart space.<br>Christian: Oh, okay. So, one thing I'm really grateful for is a couple weeks ago, I went to the National IANDS conference, the International Association for Near-Death Studies, and there were about a thousand people there, and the vast majority of them were experiencers—near-death experiencers or other spiritually transformative experience experiencers—and the love at this place for four days was like nothing I'd ever felt, and it reminded me that we really can have love and acceptance and celebration of each other on Earth because I experienced it for four days in one small place right across the street from the Pentagon, actually. It was a great dichotomy. <br>Out the window is like the center of the world's industrial military complex. Anyway, so I'm just pointing out that there was that real... there's the life contrast. There's the contrast. So, I'm really grateful for that because it was like a reminder, "Oh, this really can happen. We really can live in total love with acceptance." The second thing I'm really grateful for is my children lately. They're 14 and 12 right now. They've grown up a lot. They're very precious and independent and strong and beautiful people, and I get to see the rediscovery of the life process that from their young eyes, so I'm appreciative for that. And the last thing I'd say is I'm really appreciative of my wife actually because she has gone through a huge amount of awakening herself and growth. It hasn't been easy for her because she comes from a very conservative family. Her parents are not supportive of this open-minded message because of their religious tradition. <br>So, I'm appreciative for anyone but especially my wife who may choose the humility and the bravery it takes, like we started this conversation with, in order to question and actually grow. That's hard, and so I'm really grateful for that. And I know I've already spent my three things, but I'm also grateful for all the people that I've met throughout this work who've done just that, who've done what you described and what you're doing now because when like-minded awakening people can connect, it's like a circuit in the physical. It's like reaching down two connections to the higher realms and touching down here, and it creates like an electrical circuit or a temperature circuit in vibration. I'm really grateful for that because it is a beautiful experience to do that on Earth, and what an opportunity we have. We can all do that with each other. This kind of podcast helps serve that, and that's really beautiful.<br>Krista: Yeah, that's why I named it "I'm Awake Now What" because once I started waking up, I was like, "Oh my God, what is next?" Yeah, exactly. I get it. I totally get it. Well, thank you so much for coming here and doing this interview. I gosh, I love your book. I love everything you're doing. I really appreciate you spending the six years to investigate and to channel all of those answers. You know, I don't know if that's the right term for what you did, but just to allow us some insight when we're so confused about the veil and about what's happening. I think I wish I could have had this book like 20 years ago. I'm also 43 as well. I think it would have just... I just love it, and I love that it's going to help so many people along this awakening journey, and it's so important. And I'll be thinking about your wife. She's in good company on this podcast for sure. So, I'll be thinking about her in the next few months and giving her lots of good vibes and lots of streams.<br>This podcast was directed and produced by Krista Mara in alignment with Light Casting.

We feel like we've been buried. But what if, like a seed, we've been planted, and having been planted, would grow to become a mighty tree. Now, open your eyes, open your eyes to this way of viewing life. Come with me as we explore your true, infinite, eternal nature. This is Grief to Growth. And I am your host, Brian Smith.<br>Everybody, this is Brian back with another episode of Grief to Growth. And today, I've got with me Christian Sundberg. And I'm really excited to talk to Christian. I've been following him for a while. I've heard him speak a couple of times. He's got a fascinating story and a really great message that I think you're—I know you're going to enjoy hearing. When Christian was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. And while that memory left him completely for his early adult life, it spontaneously returned 12 years ago as he took up a meditation practice and went through a personal awakening journey. He also began to have out-of-body experiences, or OBEs.<br>Christian now often speaks publicly as he seeks to remind others of at least a small part of who we really are beneath the "human play," in quotes. Professionally, Christian has worked for 16 years as a project manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing projects and is also now working for an insurance company. He is the author of the book A Walk in the Physical, which attempts to succinctly describe the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey. So with that, welcome to Grief to Growth, Christian Sundberg.<br>Christian Sundberg: Thank you so much, Brian. It's an honor to be here. Thank you.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, as I said earlier, I'm really excited about talking to you. I've heard your story probably two or three years ago now. I've heard you speak. I reference you all the time because I've learned so much from your experiences and from what you've shared. You share your book freely. It's available for people to download for free. So you're so generous with your time, and I appreciate you being here and doing this.<br>Christian Sundberg: Sure. No problem, sir.<br>Brian Smith: So, if you could start by telling us—you said you had early remembrances when you were a child, before being in the body. So what was that like?<br>Cristian: What was the experience like? Or what was it like being a child who had the memory?<br>Brian Smith: What was the experience like? Okay, so<br><br><br>Cristian: The pre-incarnate state is very difficult to describe in language. I'll just try. First, let me just please disclaim that it's really important to say that language cannot possibly speak to this content. You know, our higher natures and who we really are—it just so vastly transcends the metaphor set that we use as humans. You know, all the forms and symbols of language—it's so crude. So it's extremely difficult to try to describe. What I can say is that we are multi-dimensional beings who are beings of love and joy and freedom. That is our true nature. That's what we really are. And we undertake certain experiences for the purposes of creativity and growth—personal growth and growth of all that is, collective growth. And the human experience is a very, very unique, very special, very high-specialty, high-uniqueness, high-level—I'm looking for extremity—type of experience that enables a very unique type of growth through the contrast of the human experience.<br>So, from that state, I—this is something that I wanted to do. And I felt very honored, deeply honored, that I was given the chance to, you know, to be human.<br>Brian Smith: So, if I remember correctly, you encountered a being in that state that inspired you to want to become human. Is that correct?<br>Cristian: Yes. Yeah. So, and again, this is so difficult to describe. Okay. Yeah. So, I remember coming across a being long, long ago, like before I had ever been physical in this type of an experience in this universe. And feeling from this being the incredible quality and nature of this being's essence—like who he is, who he was. I could feel from him because, in those reality systems, they're thought-responsive, and we're all connected to each other. We can feel the connection. We know that we're all one with each other, even as we're individuated. And this being was just so full of joy and power and love. And it was amazing. It was breathtaking. <br>And I asked him, like, "Oh my goodness, do you really feel the depths of what I feel you feel?" And he shared with me, "Yes." And he, like, kind of allowed me to telepathically explore it. And I was like, "How did you do that? Like, what could you possibly have done?" And he shared with me that he had lived physical lives. And he shared one in particular in which he had dealt with a very difficult, painful health condition that lasted for a number of years. And the way that he chose to meet that experience and integrate it and shine through it allowed a refinement of his being—a deepening and refinement of who he was and who he is. The only way I can describe it. And I was like, "I want to do that. I want to do that." Just totally inspired, like, "I want to do that. I'll do whatever it takes."<br>And, you know, at first, he kind of brushed me off—not negatively, but kind of in a playful way, like, "Yeah, that's what they all say. Like, you don't know how difficult it can be." And I persisted. And I said, "No, I want to do that. This is something I definitely, I definitely want to do." And he said, "Well, then go speak with your guides." So I did that. And I don't have memory right after that. But I remember having lived many times and then being in a period—so I don't know if you want me to go this far—but not this life before this life, but the life immediately preceding this life, I was in the in-between life state. And I remember this guide coming to me over and over again and asking, "Are you ready to go back yet? <br>Are you ready to go back yet?" Because I was taking a long break, like I was enjoying the freedom of that state of being. And it's like being on a long holiday or something and being reluctant to go back to work. I don't know—maybe that's a terrible metaphor because we don't have to do it. It's by choice. We have total freedom. We have total freedom to do this. But it was like he kept reminding me of my own intention, like, "Oh, you know, you intend to do this. Do you want to go back?" And eventually, I said, "Yes, I'm ready to go back."<br><br><br>And then, reviewing with this guide what I can only describe as my state—like who I am, who I've been, who I was—like the qualities of experience that I knew and then I had—I don't want to use the word "learned," but come to understand—and that they were a part of me. Maybe like reviewing virtues, but I don't want to put it like that because it's not like we're just, you know, earning something. It's more like what we've become able to integrate and qualities that we've developed through experience. And I could see there was this one area that was very obvious, like that it would be beneficial for me to work on that, so to speak. And it was this—it was a fear. It was this very specific low-vibration fear that had beset me, overcome me in a previous experience. And because of that fear in that lifetime, I had turned out to be a very egoic and hurtful person. I caused a lot of damage to others. <br>It's not true damage because, you know, we can't actually truly be harmed in the physical. We're immortal spirit. We can't actually be harmed. But within the context of the physical, I had caused damage to others because of this ego that had arisen in me in response to the fear. So I knew, like, "Wow, you know, if I could integrate that, if I could heal that fear and really work through that—oh, that would be incredible." But even from that point of view, I could see, like, "Oh, my goodness, the extremity of the low vibration of this fear. It was so extreme." I remember asking, "Can it even be—is this even possible? Like, has anything ever in all of creation integrated a vibration that's this low successfully?" And I was told, "Yes." And, "You have all the time available to you to do so. <br>There's no hurry." And I just knew, like, if it can be done, I will do it. You know, which, as the human, sounds so strange because I've been through a lot of trauma and pain and difficulty in this life. That's what I signed up for. But from that perspective, I knew what I am and what we are. You know, we are immortal, powerful beings. We cannot fail. We cannot die. We cannot truly be hurt. We are so—we have so much potential. I don't know how else to describe it—so much depth and wonder. And I just knew, like, if it can be done, I'll do it.<br>So, they brought me a lifetime that was appropriate for that intention. And it wasn't this life. It was the immediately preceding life. And I reviewed that lifetime, and I accepted it. And then I accepted the veil, which is just a word. But the veil represents the constraints in consciousness, space, and consciousness that go along with the incarnation. It's like a plummet in the vibration of your being—down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower from this place of total connectedness and knowing and freedom, down, down, down into this place of incredible limitation and disconnectedness. You feel separate. You know, I feel separate here. We feel separate while we're human. And a place that was very dense and also cold, just empty.<br>So, after the veil had come over me, within seconds, I'm like, "I am not doing this. This is so low vibration. This is not happening. Like, it's just no way I'm going to tolerate this for a lifetime." And I reacted in fear, you know, just immediately had so much fear prompted in me because of the vibration of just even being incarnated in this body—not this body, but the one before it. It was so low that I summoned in my mind my strength, and I fought the veil. I fought my way out. <br>And I was successful in doing so because I was back on the other side. But I became aware that by doing that, I had killed the fetus. I killed the body that was to be my body. And I had a life review, just like as described by near-death experiences. I could see how my fear had affected not only the poor mother—it was primarily the mother—but also hundreds of people that the mother would interact with in her life. It would make their journeys more difficult, all because of the grief that I had heaped onto the mother because of her loss. And I could see it very clearly.<br><br><br>So, from that side, like, it can be seen—everything's okay. Like, there's not a true failure. Everything is just a play. Like, it's okay. It's totally okay. But I also could just see very objectively, like, "Oh, man, I've got a lot of fear. I've got a lot of fear. I've got to do something about this." So, I still had this intention. So, they brought me this life sometime later. And I reviewed this life in detail. And this life was good. It wasn't as appropriate as the first one would have been. <br>The first one was like a near-perfect match for what I was trying to accomplish and experience. This life wasn't bad. And I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail—like millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold. It was like reviewing a probability tree, like if you took a tree and laid it on its side and started at the thick part of the trunk and worked your way out to the branches. <br>It was kind of like that. And the branches are like different avenues that might actualize through the life. And it was an experience of what it would be like to be me in those branches. And, you know, there were events in it, but it wasn't primarily about events. It was primarily about what I would feel and what I would experience—you know, being Christian, the human. And I reviewed it in detail, and I made certain requests for the life. And then I remember there having to be a moment to say yes. <br>And I don't remember that moment, but I remember being in this waiting area. And this being—suddenly my guide came to me and grabbed my attention, like, "Go now. Like, now's the time. Like, Earth time, buddy." That kind of thing. I was like, "Okay, now." You know, because the timeline, the linear time of Earth, is such a denser, much more—like, sludgy, slow, defined linear time. And I had to, like, engage at OSHA or something.<br>So, the next thing was I was in this room that I can only describe as a technician's chamber or a mechanic's shop, something like that, where I was over the shaft, and the Earth was below me. And there were these beings in this chamber who were very technical in nature. <br>And they're like veil technicians or something. I don't know how to describe that, but they're beings who help facilitate applying the veil to us specifically because the veil is very organic and personal. And the soul has many specific qualities, and the lifetime, the body, the circumstances—it's all something going on. And they do this thing, or they, like, energetically make it all fit. They make it all, you know, jive.<br>Christian Sundberg: And I remember them asking me one last time, "Are you sure? Are you sure you want to do this?" Because I knew once I said yes here, that I was strapped in for the ride. It's like, you know, in a roller coaster. Once you're strapped in, you can't get out till the ride comes to a complete stop. <br>That kind of thing. So I said yes. And then once again, I remember the veil coming over me in this plummet of vibration—down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. Oh my gosh, lower still, lower, more, lower still. So low. And then being in the body and sending one message back to the technicians, "Did it take? Like, did the veil take?" And getting one message back, "Yes." And I remember actually feeling a sense of accomplishment because even making it to the physical was quite an accomplishment because of the vibrational distance.<br>So then I was there for a while. And then eventually, I said, "You know what? I am not doing this. There is no way." Once again, my fear began to rise up. And because I felt like I lost all that I am. I lost all my connectedness. I lost all my knowledge. I felt like everything that I am had disappeared and had been removed. And I rejected it. And as I began to summon my mind once again, the most holy moment in my entire physical journey happened. The Spirit of God came to me. I don't know what words to use, but the Great I Am, the Spirit of all things, came to me and expanded me back out. And I felt the entire universe—the physical universe—within me, within my body, within the body of my being. <br>And I felt the churning of our Sun, Earth, Sun inside me, and the bliss of the Sun. And I felt all just incredible amounts of freedom and creativity and power, love, and joy. And when God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And that calmed me. I was like, "Oh," because I had been fighting because I felt like I lost all. But I was, you know, and it was like being shown, "No, you haven't lost. You haven't. You cannot truly lose all that you are." So I surrendered back into the existence of just being in the womb. And it was so relieved.<br>And so then I was there for a while. And then it seemed like a long while. And the next moment I remember is being born. I remember the shock and the sensation of being born—the temperature, you know, the cold, the light, the touching, you know, all this extreme experience. But I had no idea what was happening. Like, I had no intellectual context at all. I remember looking up at the nurses and just being like, "Who are these beings taking care of me? Like, what is going on?" <br>And just feeling intensely curious. And I don't remember anything much after that until a few years later, you know, as I began to grow up. I remember drawing upon the flowchart memory and like trying to anticipate what was going to happen in my life, just for simple, mundane things like, "Who's going to come over tomorrow?" or, you know, whatever simple thing that I had wanted to know. I would just try to pluck it out of the database and, you know, just because I was curious. But that ability diminished quickly as I aged, you know, especially by the age of four or five, definitely by six or seven. I, you know, the memory left me completely, and I wasn't able to do that anymore.<br>So, yeah, that's a quick summary of the experience. You know, I know that the experience is interesting to people, of course, but I think it's far more important that we focus on what we really are, who we really are. Because that is the most important message. You know, here we are on Earth, having this incredibly rich, rigorous—oftentimes it seems mercilessly rigorous—experience where even death can happen. But who we truly are—in that, there is absolutely nothing to fear. <br>We cannot lose what we love. We cannot fail. Like, we need to remind each other that even though we're deeply veiled here, and it's intentional—there's a good reason for it—right? Even though that's true, like, I just feel it's so important to remind each other of what we really are. There is just so much freedom in that.<br>Brian Smith: Well, the reason, Christian, why I wanted you to recount that, and the reason why I find it important for my audience and for myself, is that we're here, and it seems more rigorous for some of us than others. We know my audience is largely people who have lost someone, specifically children, because I work with an organization where 25,000 people or so have lost children. And we often ask ourselves, "Why are we here? What is the point?" And when you say to someone who's gone through that experience, "You planned this for yourself," it takes a lot of convincing. I know even people that, yeah, I would plan something like this. And your description is so—it makes you really feel that separation that we have when we come here. Yeah. And that sense of abandonment, that sense of fear. And I find it really fascinating that you felt that even in the womb before you even came into the world. That vibration was so much lower.<br>Cristian: I was in the world. I just hadn't been born yet. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, we use the human—yeah. So part of the human state. Sorry, go ahead.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah. So, I find it interesting also, as I've explored these ideas, and you know, I read your book, and I know you've referenced Tom Campbell's book a lot. And I just finished My Big TOE (The Theory of Everything). When you say being in the physical, is that because this means everything is physical, and really nothing is physical, right? We're the—it's all mental. But this vibration seems to be different.<br><br><br>Cristian: Yeah, so the experience of the physical is an experience happening in consciousness. And that's an important thing to focus on because we tend to believe that the physical is fundamentally real—that there are these objects, there are these rocks, there are these bodies. And we're all separate from each other. And this is what's most real. It's a very, you know, it's very convincing, and it is a real experience. But the forms themselves are not fundamentally real. What's fundamentally real is us—the stuff, the stuff of life, spirit itself, the knower of the experience. And so here in the physical, we experience a very, very physical, tangible experience. <br>But just as physical or intangible, or even more so, an experience can and is experienced in other reality systems. Like, if you go out of body, it depends on the type of experience. But if you're having, like, you know, what I would call a local astral experience—I'm not big on the terms and the labels—but you're having an experience like that. It's very, very physical. It's so normal that you can't even tell a difference. You know, it's so normal. So, in those kinds of experiences, you realize, "Oh, my goodness, the physical—you know, I'm experiencing something super physical here, but it's not the same." <br>And very much in higher systems, they're even more real—like the lucidity and the clarity and the colors and the light and the connectedness that we feel with each other and with the environment. It is just so absolutely real—like, more even more real than this life. That there is no doubt to the veracity of that type of physicality. So, I don't know if that speaks to your question, but—<br>Brian Smith: It does. Because, again, I think people—because we become so attached to this place, and we—because we become so—we can't remember the other way. Associated with—yeah, exactly—with the body and with the physical. When we think of the other realms, we think of them as kind of ethereal, kind of dream-like. I know they're more thought-responsive. But I've had people say to me, "Well, if I have something in that, is it real? And if someone says I have a house, is it a real house? Because my house was a real house, but those houses aren't real?"<br>Cristian: And I see. So, what is real then? Right? Yeah, what's most real? What's the most real thing is the substance of spirit. So, you could say Source, God, the ocean, the great ocean of all that is. That is the most real. And you are a drop in and of that ocean. You are real. Your spirit is real. So, like, as a simple metaphor, like, where did your five-year-old body go? Well, it's gone. There's no more five-year-old body. It's, for all intents and purposes, it's dead. Right? It's not here anymore. But you're still here. You, the experiencer, are still here. <br>And there's not actually a huge distinction between a five-year-old body, a 60-year-old body, or a body that has died. It's actually not—there's a seamless, you know, connection between them all because you, the experiencer, remain whether or not your body is a certain age or the constraints of the body have been relinquished. And when the constraints are relinquished, those experiences and those higher systems absolutely can be even more real. It's like—it's like if we watch a black-and-white television, a small black-and-white television, that's like the Earth experience. It's real. You're watching a real black-and-white movie. <br>And then you go into an IMAX theater, you know, and you're seeing the whole thing, and it's colorful, and it's full of sound, and it's all mine. It's 100 times more real and rich. It's kind of like that metaphorically. And then you go back into the black-and-white movie, and someone says, "Well, how do you know that was real?" There's no doubt. You know, when you have that personal experience, the black-and-white movie seems like the less real experience. It's still real. It's just a much denser and, you know, different type of experience.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, and what you're saying lines up with what people who have had near-death experiences tell us. You know, they say, "We're that experience—that was more real than this." It's again, it's kind of hard to describe, I guess, like trying to describe colors to someone who's only ever seen black and white.<br>Cristian: Exactly. It is like that very much.<br>Brian Smith: So, when you—so you had these memories when you came into the world, and then they faded, and then they came back to you later in life as you started your meditation practice. Is that correct?<br><br><br>Cristian: Yeah. So, I had a very traumatic experience at the age of 22. It was a health-related PTSD-creating experience. And I went through years of counseling for that. And in that experience, I had the opportunity to re-engage this very, very low-vibration fear. And so, after I had gone through a long healing process of engaging that trauma and healing it internally, after that, after I had done a lot of that work, I then subsequently took up a meditation practice, originally because of Tom Campbell, actually. His suggestion: "Go investigate. Just go see what your own consciousness is." I didn't expect anything. <br>I just started and continued because, at first, I just felt some peace. You know, meditating was peaceful, and it felt good. But after a few months, I had my first non-physical experience, and it was brief, but it was super eye-opening—like, super, like, "Holy cow, there really is something going on here." And then, as I continued in that way, the pre-birth memory all of a sudden was just there. It was just like someone had blown leaves off of the ground, and there was the grass—like, the most normal thing in the world. It's totally normal. <br>And it's like, even when I first mentioned it years later to a couple of people, and that's pretty extraordinary, it's like, "It doesn't feel extraordinary at all." It's just one—once your state of awareness is closer to our true nature, to that non-form-associated nature, it becomes natural for those larger portions of ourselves to rise up back to us on their own.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, I was reading Tom Campbell's book. I read your book, and then I read Tom Campbell's book because you referenced him, and I've been wanting to read it for a long time anyway. And yeah, he says, "Go out and explore your unconsciousness." And that's where I'm kind of stuck. I'm doing meditation, and I'm like, "I'm not having these experiences." So, with you, they were—you didn't seem to have the out-of-body experience. You were just doing the meditation practice.<br>Cristian: Correct. That's right. Okay. Yeah, I didn't expect anything. And actually, having no expectation, I feel, is very important. Because if you're sitting down thinking, "Okay, I'm going to have an out-of-body experience," then that's your intention. You're seeking. So, your intention is what the universe is listening to, what your body is listening to—your actual intention. <br>And so, having the intention of actually moving towards your own awareness itself, beneath all form and beneath all expectation, beneath all thought—all thought—just to experience what your consciousness itself is, that is—word usage is limited here—but you could say, like, a pure intent, to just go back towards full alertness, full openness, not making anything up, full objectivity, full openness, and acceptance of the present moment. And then, what's interesting is not because you're trying, but once you have full openness, full clarity, full acceptance, you are no longer looking at the form, even though you don't, you know, you don't necessarily know that that was your initial intention. <br>You're just no longer associated with thinking, associated with the senses of the body. You're just alert and alive. And when that happens, like I said, these other portions of yourself that are already on the other side of the veil right now—they might bubble up because you've simply put down the objects that you aren't. Like, you aren't your thoughts. You aren't your body. Right?<br>Brian Smith: So, it's a question that, you know, a lot of people have, and they've asked me this question, and I want to put it to you: Like, okay, so if we're these—and I—people have used the word for me—perfect. If we're these perfect beings on the other side, then why do we have to come here to improve ourselves?<br><br><br>Cristian: Yeah. So, there is—okay. So, first of all, it's not "have to," it's "choose to." There are two simultaneous truths of the nature of our nature. That sounds contradictory. Here in duality, right now, we're in duality. So, we like to think it's black or white. It's up or down. It's perfect or not perfect. Which one is it? Right, exactly. But that's not an accurate way to approach it because duality itself is non-fundamental. It's an experience of a certain definition. Our true being is itself the substance of being itself. It is already perfect. There is nothing required of it. There's no—there's nothing needed. There is no need to justify or to prove yourself worthy or to be anything because you are already intrinsically worthy. You're already intrinsically a part of God, the ocean. It's beautiful. <br>Okay, so—but then, that perfection chooses to engage manifest creation for the purposes of the refinement of being—further refinement. And I know that sounds like already a contradiction in duality, but it's not. You could say the water of the ocean itself is perfect. But the water decides, chooses, to go through a process of refinement in order to expand the depths and the heights of what it is. So, to expand all that is, you could say that contrast itself is a tool, you know, like, we engage the lowest, most difficult depths of darkness and integrate them so as to expand the heights of joy into measure, they say. <br>So, it's like the contrast is not greater than we are. We precede the contrast. But we utilize the contrast in order to refine the depths of what we forever are. And a short, relatively short human journey, even though it's very dense and potentially rigorous, a relatively short human journey is worth the price to the being who chooses to come and engage this very rich contrast. Now, now that we're here, you know, like, "Hey, everyone listening today, we made it, you know, like, we're in the human condition, right?" <br>Now, we know how hard it can be. Holy cow, the state of separation—it can be no joke, you know. This is the—if you want to draw a spectrum of duality here—and again, duality itself is not fundamental—but if you want to draw a line between unity and separation, we have gone all the way out to the most separate type of experience that has yet been created. The deepest, you know, the veil that permits such a deep sense of separation. <br><br><br>And that depth of separation is alien, actually, to the spirit. We're not—our native state is connected. And we know and feel that connection with each other and with all things all the time. To be human and to actually experience being separate from everyone else and alone—that is a very unusual state of being, and it can prompt fear. In that contrast is the opportunity.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, yeah. I like—I love the way you put that. And I think a lot of us can relate to that because it's kind of—it's interesting how we come here, we experience this separation, we experience the fear. And I remember being a child and thinking, "What kind of a crazy world?" I think all of us have had, at some point, you know, I grew up in the '60s. I remember the television, the Vietnam War, and, you know, race riots and stuff. And I'm like, "This world is nuts." Right? But then we kind of fall into it, but then we're always seeking that connection again. I think while we're here, we get homesick.<br>Cristian: Oh, yes, absolutely. We're always all seeking that connection all the time. You could say that we're all seeking—to put it bluntly, we're all seeking God all the time. We try to fill that hole with everything we can, you know. We try to plug into substances or relationships or, you know, experiences of some kind or identity or, you know, money or whatever. You know, we're always—the ego is always trying to grasp, fill the hole, fill the hole, you know. <br>But that's because of that state of separation that now we know something dear is missing. And too often, we don't look inward—not just inward because inward makes it sound like it's not to something real—to the aliveness that we are, to the nature of consciousness itself. We forget to look deeply there because, in that, that connectedness is real right now. Like, we are connected to those we love and to all that is right now, even though we're this deeply engaged in an experience of separation.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah. Well, we're connected on some level that we're typically not aware of while we're here.<br>Cristian: Correct. But we are actually already there. This is an important point because it makes it sound like, "Well, it's not—I mean, because we often think, 'Oh, it's not real. I mean, come on. It's not real. I don't see it. I don't feel it.' You know, so it doesn't count." I feel it's important to point towards the realness of it, like, and I know it's darn frustrating until we feel that connection. <br>Sure. I'm not making light of that. But I do feel it's worthwhile to point out that by investigating your own awareness itself, with—let go of all these form associations, all the thoughts, all the pains, all the story—put the whole story down, all the trappings of identity, just put it down and just be fully alert with who you are. That connectedness is already there. <br>And sometimes, like we discussed earlier, you may reach a point where something arises. And I could even describe it as like an inversion point, perhaps, where all of a sudden, that aliveness of your body can, like, flip—I don't know, like, inside out or something—and you feel the connectedness. It never went anywhere.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, I think, for me, I use analogies. And I think there's a lot of good analogies in Hollywood. Like the movie The Matrix, you know, how that reality, when you're in it, it feels real, but it's not the ultimate reality. Avatar—they are in the lab. There's a movie called Total Recall, you know, where you have memories of planets. So, those are things that kind of work for me. It's like, we're experiencing this, but we're not really here because it's not really, ultimately real.<br>Cristian: That's true. It's like, metaphorically, like, we've fallen asleep and are having the dream of Earth. And that is like The Matrix. You know, I like in The Matrix when Neo is first in the white room with the couch, you know, when he's feeling the couch, and he says, "This isn't real." Yeah, well, that's how it is with, you know, the objects in our world. This isn't always a real experience. You are really having the experience you're having right now. It's not that the experience isn't real. But truly, we do transcend the experience. We've just come very deep into the matrix. And there really is a higher realm, for sure.<br>Brian Smith: So, when you—there's a couple of other things that people see as black or white, you know. Another one is predestination versus free will. So, people talk about soul plans, and you talked about being able to see your life. But there seems to be an element of free will as well. So, how do those two interplay with each other?<br><br><br>Cristian: Okay, so the flowchart that I reviewed was a probability tree, not a predestined script. And the thing that determined which branch of the probability tree actualized was free will—my choice-making and the choice-making of everybody else. It's just that the system, as it's put in Tom Campbell's terms, the system has all the data. So, it knows really well—it knows you really well, and it knows me really well, and it knows all the billions of players super well. And then it is running the simulation. So, it's very good at predicting likely outcomes. <br>But novelty still happens because free will is still running. We all are making choices every day. And sometimes, we make choices that may have been less likely in the past, but now they're being actualized. And that may affect someone else in a way that was unanticipated. So, you could say that the system is very good at predicting outcomes, but free will absolutely always, always occurs. It's just free will within the context. <br>Like, when I say free will, I don't mean the freedom to make any choice anywhere, like, "I can't decide to go to Jupiter right now." I mean, free will within the constraints of the context. You are free to choose whatever you can identify. That's a big part of it because a lot of us have a lot of choices we can't consciously identify, right? You're free to choose anything you can identify in anything that the rule set—another Tom Campbell term—of the physical reality permits.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, and there's even, you know, when we think about this, even from our human perspective, we know each other, kind of, right? And I know certain things that my wife is more likely to do and less likely to do, just from having known her for a few years, not even being able to be inside of her head. So, you can imagine that if you did have all the data, you could make some really, really good guesses. And even within myself, I mean, there are certain things that I am free to do, technically, but I would never do.<br>Cristian: Exactly, yeah. There's one other element to that, which is worth mentioning. And that is that there are—this is hard to describe—they're energetic areas of the play that transpire. So, you could say themes for the whole play. So, the whole play is going through a theme, through a maturity process, and all the players actually know that theme. <br>And so, because that's the theme of the act, that plays a significant part in what's going to happen, what is likely to happen or less likely to happen. So, like, right now, you know, we're in a period of the play you could call the awakening—that we're trying to process all sorts of old, very dense, fear-based garbage in the collective consciousness and to grow and to awaken. <br>And that process is happening. And we're trying to do a lot in a relatively short amount of time. And from that side, pre-birth, I just knew, like, "Okay, you know, this is just the period that this is—it's very exciting, like, super exciting to be on Earth during this time and a profound honor to have the opportunity to be on Earth at this time." But anyway, I'm just saying that that act of the play is known to, and that has, like, an energetic—it affects the temperature of the water, you could say something.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, so that's a really good point because I do feel like—and I guess lots of generations have said this in the past—but, you know, Tom Campbell talks about in his book about how, you know, we invented one way to kill off the whole planet. Now, we've invented several ways. So, we are at a point where we have to grow up really quickly. Do you think that the souls who are here now said, "Hey, yeah, I'll go in, and I'll play my part in this really important time"?<br><br><br>Cristian: Yes, everyone who's here has chosen to come. I mean, I won't speak for anybody else, but from what I experienced, I feel very confident that yes, we all choose it because the soul itself is sovereign, right? It's a part of the ocean. There is no greater power than God, of which we are a part. You could say you're like a fragment of God. So, the only way that you can be veiled and restricted is to self-surrender. There's no other way. <br>So, anyway, I'm just pointing that out because everyone who participates has had to self-surrender at some point in order to engage this point in the context. Okay, so, but then, more specifically to your question, speaking to the era of the play, yes, I do think many individuals have chosen to come now in order to help. I think there are a lot of beings who are more loving or sensitive or wise or caring in certain ways. <br>And just them being here alters the temperature of the water, you know, because you think of the human race as like a collective consciousness, like a pond within the ocean. That pond is comprised of only so many people, beings, and those beings are each contributing something vibrationally to the temperature of the water in the pond. So, I do feel that higher vibrational beings, more evolved beings, do choose to come to help, to assist, to bring that temperature up because if the temperature raises, it kind of prompts everybody to face their own crap, you know, because the temperature is getting higher now. So, now it's like, "Okay, now you're less resonant with the super low-vibration, older stuff." And it has to come up to the surface to be faced and processed. And we've seen a lot of that in our world in the last couple of decades, probably.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah. Yeah, that's a great point. I also want to ask you about—you know, people who have near-death experiences, and you talk about a lot too how we are infinitely loved beyond what we can possibly understand. Yeah, but I know some people have gone and said, "Well, God is kind of like impersonal. God's just a force." So, what's this thing about love? And where does that come from?<br><br><br>Cristian: Oh, it's both. It's absolutely personal, very specific to you, and also the very substance of reality itself, which you could call impersonal. You could say that the stuff of spirit that is beyond description is love. It's synonymous with love. It's our true nature. That love, that freedom, that joy is the substance of being. It's the very what and why of all things. <br>That there is no greater—like, it's just one, you know, we use one word. When I say love, I don't just mean the emotion that we associate with love, though that is a profound portion of it. I mean something that's beyond all description—an adoration and a value and a celebration of each life, each moment, each one of us, every molecule of our body, and every portion of our being. It's a celebration that is incredibly wise and totally unconditional. But like, there is nothing you could do—nothing you could do—that would separate you from that love or make it, you know, less. That's not how it works. <br>So, I don't know what else I can say about it, like, that is the nature. So, at least I can reiterate, yes, if we're going to put it in colloquial religious terms, God loves you, specifically you. Like, you can call it something else. I mean, I'm not sensitive to the terminology.<br>Brian Smith: I think it's really interesting. I love the way you explain it because we do think of love as conditional for the most part. I mean, we—I think the closest thing we have to unconditional love would be our children. Yes. I think once you have a child, and for me anyway, that's like, that's when I first understood unconditional love. It's like, "I will love this being no matter what." But to say it's unconditional, and God loves everybody, and it also loves you uniquely and specifically—I think that's what people have trouble wrapping their heads around.<br><br><br>Cristian: Oh, it's very much both. And it's used specifically—it's a really, really key part of it. Each one of us is like—oh, I wish I could communicate this—like an absolutely irreplaceable fragment of all that is, precious beyond all the riches of the world. Irreplaceable. Every one of us. I just—I don't know how to possibly articulate that. But when we reach those states, we know it, and we feel it. <br>And it's breathtaking. You know, it's a type of love that on Earth we very rarely get real glimmers of. It's so many magnitudes beyond what we commonly experience on Earth that it seems so foreign to us to see. But that's the nature of this experience, though, you know. We've come into a place where we are veiled from it, and we feel so separate, and it makes us feel so alone. And it's like being in the cold. Like, I like the metaphor of being up on Mount Everest, you know, or climbing a big tall mountain. <br>And we get here, and we're like, "Oh my gosh, it's cold. There's no air up here. I can't breathe." Yes, that's how Mount Everest is. But the question isn't whether or not it's cold. The question is, what do you do with it now? How do you respond? How do you meet Mount Everest? What meaning do you put on Mount Everest? How do you allow your love that came with you and is you—how do you allow it to shine on Mount Everest? How do you meet the cold, you know?<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, yes. So, it's well put. And, you know, it's interesting. We all ask this question, "Why am I here?" And some people say, "We come to learn." And again, the question, "Well, if I know everything, then what am I here to learn?" Some people say, "We come here for the experience." And I was talking with a guy once, and he said, "We also come here to have that feeling of abandonment—to know what that feels like, to know what it feels like to be separate. That's actually part of the plan."<br>Cristian: Yes, that's true. So, the learning we do is not intellectual. It's experiential learning. So, it's a learning of the being with a capital B by being something with a lowercase B. So, the only way to actually know, you know, some experience is to actually be the person who experiences it. Like, you have to actually be you all the way. Man, you've got to go all the way in. Yeah, if you want to really know separation, then you really need to know separation. There's no—and spirit's very good at that. Sorry.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, no, that's great. No, I think that's where we get confused because we think of intellectual knowledge. And people will say things like, "Well, God is omniscient. And if we're omniscient beings, then what is there to learn?" But what I've come to realize, as you said, is you can only know what it's like to be something if you're that. You can only know what it's like to be cold if you're cold. You can only know what it's like to be hungry if you're hungry.<br>Cristian: Yeah, exactly. So, just a very simple example. So, like, when I was a kid, I went to church camp. And I remember that there was a trust fall exercise, and I had a lot of fear. I didn't want to let go and fall into the arms of a bunch of strangers. So, the act of standing up on that log and being prepared to fall backwards into the arms of the strangers—is that a moment of intellectual learning? No, it's a moment of quality of intent. That's a Tom Campbell term. In other words, I had to choose to overcome my fear and to let go. <br>Now, interestingly, in this short story—this is just a personal part of this story—I fell backwards, and they dropped me. After I finally got up the nerve, and the counselor looked mortified that they had not, you know, proven that trust—that they could be trusted in that moment. I remember staring up with the wind knocked out of me, like, hurting my whole body and going, "Oh, my God." <br>But, you know what? I survived. And, you know, I—and it's just like, how else can the being have that experience? It sounds like a simple experience. I won't forget that experience. You know, that experience is simple. But how else can you know what it's like to not be caught? How else can you know what it's like to have to build up the courage and fall backwards? Or all the things that we do in life? You know, how do you respond when someone's driving on the road and they flick you off? <br>Okay, so that triggers something, and how do you respond? How else can you know who you are? Because when we have a life review, our constraints are fully recognized. It's all seen—all the limitations, all the pain we've ever known. It's all seen. It's all understood. It's totally understood, like, 100%, 1,000% understood. But then, who are you in that context? <br>And then you learn about yourself. You see, because then you see, "Oh, I really am the person who responded in anger when someone gave me anger. Hmm, why?" You see, and then we can learn and grow from that. Where else can you do that except in a circumstance in which you don't know you're connected to that person and that they're your loving brother or sister, and they're reflecting you off? You know, like, anyway, it's a simple—it's a silly example, but—<br>Brian Smith: No, it's actually a great example because, again, when people first encounter these concepts, you know, there's that pushback, like, "Well, the other thing is, this is too much. If I were setting up this lab, children wouldn't get cancer. Yes, no one would have chronic illnesses. I mean, why would I make it so hard?"<br>Cristian: Yes, no, absolutely. I don't make light of that. So, I just want to make a couple of comments. First of all, when we are pre-life—at least in my case, I can say pre-life, trying to decide what to engage—we know that the more contrast, the greater the opportunity. So, it's often us who say, "Give me it all. I want to do it all. I want to have this. I want to do the hard thing here. I want to stack it up, make the sandwich nice and thick, you know." <br>And then the guides are often the ones that say, "That's more than you can bite off. You can't chew that much sandwich. You know, that's too much. That won't be helpful. Like, there's an optimal amount of sandwich here." Yeah, I'm being a little silly, but it's us who say, "I want to do it all," you know, sometimes—not always, but many times, it's our desire to expand and that measure—that, you know, allows us to ask for that. <br>Okay, the other thing I want to point out, though, is that, okay, for all the extremity—and I'm not trying to make light of or justify—I am not justifying all the horrors that occur, all the ways we traumatize each other every day. But the depth of spirit is greater, deeper than the most deep contrast that can possibly arise on Earth. Like, who we are is more powerful, more full of life than anything that could possibly—like, I mean, I know to the human ego that rejects the experience and that raises its mighty righteous fist, that's hard. It's a very hard pill to swallow. <br>But I'm just pointing out that it's our own un-involved oneness that our own evolved—and this is why we experience so much fear. And it's the fear that hurts. It's our rejection that hurts. It's the negative meaning that we put on all the pain we've been served that hurts. <br><br><br>Once we drop all that rejection and fully feel even the deepest self-sorrow and pain—if we fully, fully feel that, we can process it and integrate it, and it vanishes because consciousness is deeper than it all. It's our rejection that hurts.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, and, you know, we've seen that in people who have gone through just things that some of us can't even imagine. I've interviewed several Holocaust survivors on my program, and you see them overcome those things. So, what I hear you saying is the human spirit is mightier than all the crap that we can't even imagine that takes place in this Earth.<br>Cristian: And it doesn't even need to be qualified as a human spirit. Your spirit, you—yeah, are deeper than all that, than all the crap. And then, one third comment that I'll make is that sometimes there are outcomes that happen due to tragedy on Earth that we couldn't have foreseen that might be valuable in some way. So, sometimes there is meaning that is invisible to us. And that's important to recognize as well because the human ego can't see that. Like, what comes to mind is when I was around 25 or 26—I think it was 26, I forget the exact year—but my father had a second family, and he and his wife had, you know, some children together. <br>And they had a son named Jack, my brother, my half-brother, and he ended up passing away from brain cancer. So, watching a three-year-old go through the dying process and die is just about one of the worst things that can be experienced. I mean, it's horrifying. Okay, so, I don't know what Jack signed up for pre-life, but I do have a strong intuitive sense that that journey—that that was a journey that he agreed to undertake for some reason, some benefit to someone around him. And I won't go into detail on it. That—that's their human ego, I'm sure, is, "Oh, that's a big no, like, there's no way that that could have had any value." <br><br><br>But to the immortal spirit that cannot truly be harmed, this—this short walk—the name of my book is A Walk in the Physical—the short walk outside into the physical world, it's an opportunity. It's a journey, you know, it's a chance to experience even incredible rigors that otherwise we could not and to know ourselves in ways that we could not have known ourselves before. It's very important that we remember that. And then, finally, this is so key—that love that we develop with each other, even in a relatively short relationship, that love remains. Like, we are love. <br>So, we can't lose those that physically die that we're close to. We cannot lose them. That love is a powerful, living bridge right now. Yeah, the body may pass. It's like taking off a shirt. Like, you take off a shirt and throw it on the floor, and it's not really a big deal. You're still you. That person is still them. It's just now we can't physically see them. So, we mourn, and we mourn the physical sensation, the touch, we mourn the interaction, but the living connection remains. <br>It can't possibly die. I've heard it described by some, like, on the other side, it's like they hear our loving thoughts like a chime on the wind—I think is something that Silver Birch wrote, that's a guide that I love—like a chime on the wind that they can follow back to us. Like, I love that. And that connection is always there. I just think it's really important to lift up because, on Earth, change is so darn final. It's like, it's so mercilessly final. But the spirit is more than that. And that connection can't actually be lost.<br>Brian Smith: I'm glad you brought that up. I have friends who have lost children to cancer. And someone I met not too long ago—her son was born with a congenital birth defect, and he just passed a couple of days ago at the age of 14 and was never able to speak or walk. But that family, you know, just getting to know them a little bit—I've gotten to know them—that child brought so much joy to their lives and changed their lives so much. <br>You know, and like, he talked about the ripple effect of you just coming into the womb. Imagine a child coming in and spending three or four or 15 years here. Yes, the ripples that they send out—it's just so—we look at the pain, but it seems like it's all redeemed at some level.<br>Cristian: Oh, yes, there is no pain that spirit doesn't ultimately use for the better. You know, the system is very efficient, and love is very wise. And so, I'm not making light of the finality of those losses. I know I'm not making light of that. It's just that the love that we are is deeper. And I really think that's important to remember in the midst of all this. Yeah, we've all lost, you know, everyone here is human, man. We all go through the wringer, and some more than others. <br>But it's not just—and it's not a one-off thing. It's not just how we affect each other physically in those three years or five years or 14 years or one week in the womb. There is an energetic reality that is happening. Our mere presence on the Earth, the very thoughts that we issue, the very love that we express and give birth through each other—that it's valuable. It has a reality to it in higher systems that can be seen and felt. It's like, it's so creative and so powerful. So, there can be incredible bounty that comes from life that may be short in a physical sense that we cannot physically see that will last far past the end of this play.<br>Brian Smith: You just touched on something I want to talk about a little bit because Tom Campbell talks about this a little bit. I want to get your thoughts on the interaction between the next realm or the higher level of—I don't like the term "higher," but that next realm and our realm. How much interaction is there, you know, either way, both ways?<br>Cristian: Yeah, there's a lot of interaction. It's just that our reality is very dense, very dense. So, it's very slow by comparison to change. In our thoughts, even our very thoughts are very crude and clunky and slow by comparison to the speed of thought and interaction that occurs in higher systems. But anyway, they do interact all the time. You could say that the physical is subsequent to the non-physical, like, maybe like saying on a computer server—as a bad metaphor—but, you know, what's the relationship between the game world and the game server? <br>Well, there can't be a game world without the computer that's running it. And in Campbell's metaphor, he actually has an acronym for that computer. He calls it the LCS—the Living Computer System, right? And the LCS is a portion in consciousness that is giving rise to the simulation. I think that's an okay way to put it back. And so, when I say "higher," I don't mean higher as in better. More, I mean higher only as in vibrational. You can feel the difference, you know, when you engage those higher, preceding, more fundamental systems. And they do interact all the time.<br>Brian Smith: And this goes back to—I want to just go back to the free will versus predetermination thing. I just rewatched the movie because Tom Campbell's book reminded me of it—The Adjustment Bureau. Remember that movie? Yeah, because I thought—because I'm like, I'm trying to reconcile these things, right? So, some people say it's all predetermined. Some people say it's free will. And there seems to be an overarching plan. And then there are these beings that are like, "Let's get back on track."<br>Cristian: Yes. You know what's awesome about that movie is in the last scene when they're up—I don't mean to spoil this—spoiler, I'm about to spoil the ending of the movie for anybody who hasn't seen this movie yet. At the end of the movie, when they're up on the rooftop, and they have an interaction with God, basically, God changes the entire plan of the universe for their love. <br>Yeah. And then the Adjustment Bureau no longer has anything to follow through on. So, I like that. I like that ending because that is very helpful to help understand the depth of the unconditional love that exists for us. And it is our ability to make choices here that's one of the things that makes this such a rich and powerful opportunity—is precisely in that we have free will to make choices that may not be according to plan.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, and I think it's really important—good for people coming out of a background where it's like, "Okay, God put me here. It's God's plan for me." Where I'm understanding, it's more of an interactive thing. It's like we agree, and we work out the plan together with ourselves or teams or guides, whoever.<br>Cristian: Yes, I like to say metaphorically, it's like we've gone in the backyard, and we're playing in the cold mud, you know, and God is still there in the kitchen watching over. It's not really a big deal that we're out playing in the mud. We're the ones who decided to come out and play in the mud with a lot of help and with a lot of guidance, you know. This is a very efficient process that we're engaged in. <br>And it's a process that very much transcends the limitations of one lifetime, let alone one year, one day. I mean, we are immortal beings. So, the opportunity to engage a 100-year lifetime or less to really develop and grow and learn in some way—that is a profound gift, actually. And yeah, so we are helped from the non-physical. In fact, I think that there are more non-physical beings involved in our physical simulation than there are even physical players in the game, helping us all the time, providing nudges and providing guidance in whatever small way they can while also maintaining the veracity of the simulation. That's important.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, yeah. Well, I want to talk because there's something that you had said in your book—and let people know your book is great. It's like, it's a series of very short, very to-the-point essays that tie together, and they reference each other. So, it's different from any book I've ever read. But one of the things you talked about—you say, "Our joy, our destination is our joy." So, explain what you mean by that.<br>Cristian: I had to say joy is our true nature. It is the substance of what we are, and it's our birthright. It's what is—it's a heartless, you could say that when we are our true selves, there is incredible amounts of joy. Joy is like—it's synonymous with love, and it's synonymous with the natural trait of what we are. And I don't know how else to describe—I don't know if "trait" is the right word. It's synonymous with the nature of being. So, no matter how far we venture into limitation, no matter how deep we get into the characters, we can't help but be our true nature. <br>So, one way or another, we will end up back in total joy and total freedom and total bliss and total unconditional love. That is the truth. There's—you may go for a lifetime, you may go within a lifetime on other journeys, you may go and have some side journey, whatever. No matter how deep your adventure, it is always natural to return home to who you really are—to take off the backpack, put it down, come back from the forest, and say, "Wow, I just had a very long, crazy journey. Put down the backpack. You return home." And you know, "Oh, joy is what I am. Maybe next time I'll go climb a mountain." But it's up to you. You don't have to go climb a mountain. You can decide what you want to do. You're free.<br>Brian Smith: Yeah, I really wanted to make sure we got that point across. I think I said it wrong. It's like, "Joy, your destination is joy," that we are all—because, you know, there are some people that believe that, you know, we can become eternally lost. We can become, you know, we can go too far away, you know, we can lose the light. So, how would you respond to that?<br><br><br>Cristian: Yeah, so there are hellish experiences that happen both on Earth and in thought-responsive reality systems. What I mean is when we have fear, that is when we have rejection, when we have all the—all the fear gives rise to many patterns of the ego, you know—anger, jealousy, all, you know, all the things that we try to grab onto when we associate deeply with that. And it all boils down to fear. So, when we have fear that we have not yet processed, it can be a hellish experience, whether on Earth or whether we find ourselves in a thought-responsive reality that is reacting to our fear and that we're giving rise to. <br>So, we could potentially create a non-fundamentally real hellish experience without even being aware of it. However, importantly, all experiences of form—all of them—are non-fundamental. They're transitory. They're temporary. All form is temporary. The five-year-old body that was you is gone. It's temporary. This experience will pass. And even a subsequent experience of potentially great fear, whether in this or another reality system, it too will pass because they are all manifestations of our journey into contrast, whether it be in this physical reality or another. They're all sojourns. <br>And we always return from those sojourns. And like I said, use that contrast for the expansion of what is real and what is lasting, what is true. It is not possible to be eternally separated from the light or something. No, no. The experience of separation—we're already at the extreme point right now, like, this is it. We're here. <br>And then, but see, now that we're here, we have a lot of fear because this is a crazy alien state. So, now we spin all sorts of terrifying stories. We've even created beliefs like, "You can be eternally damned and burn in hell forever." You know, we, because we're fearful, so we come up with that stuff. We enshrine it in our religions. We use it to maybe—I mean, I'm not trying to generalize—it's been enshrined in the past in certain religious traditions. And then that belief might be used to cause more fear, to be used in control, whatever. That's all fear. That whole fear orgy is not fundamental to what we are. It's all a journey. It's all a sojourn. <br>And no matter what, one way or another, we will end up back to the wholeness and the truth, the true love and the joy and the freedom of what we really are. We're actually there right now. It's just that we're so far vibrationally deep in association with this limitation that we don't feel it. That's a key distinction because I think a lot of people think, "Oh, I'm trapped in the physical. I'm trapped in this world. I'm not really there. I'm trapped, I'm trapped, I'm trapped. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it." <br><br><br>It's precisely the association with those negative interpretations, that fear, that is the separator. That's the vibrational separator. We can let that go all the way and find we never left. You never left freedom and the joy of your being. <br>So, you'll often hear experiences where people may find themselves in like a hellish environment until they cry out or until they focus upward, as you say, and then all of a sudden, there is a great connection. Maybe a beam will come, or they'll fall, or they'll see the light or something, or whatever. I'm not going to try to judge or label. I'm just saying that that wholeness and that love and that peace and that joy—that is the true nature that was always there. So, as soon as we change our focus back to it, of course, there is a response. <br>Our focus—always our focus and our intention—always has an effect. I think that's a key point. I know I've gone on for a long time and covered a lot of different topics, but I just want to highlight this one last thing: Our intention is our primary power. What we're intending—the quality of our intention—is the primary question at hand. Are we making a choice? <br>So, intention is first, and it reflects through choice-making. Are we making a choice that's based in love or based in fear? That's always the primary. I mean, of course, there are thousands of facets to that choice. I'm not saying it's a simple choice. But at the root of it, it's, "Are you meeting this moment—whatever's happening, whether it be this reality or another system—how are you meeting this moment with love or fear?" <br>And then, if you choose love, you and all the things that love meets will naturally, vibrationally, instantly move closer to who you already really are. It's kind of like if you go and look at a beautiful sunset, and for a minute, you just drop all your crap, and you just enjoy the beauty of the sunset. Maybe you remember some love that you know, and you feel—for just that glimmer of a moment, you feel, "Ah," you feel that connectedness. <br>You never went anywhere. It's just that you changed your focus. You changed your allowing to recognize the beauty that is being expressed to you and allow it. Vibrationally, it immediately returns you closer—a step closer to that connectedness state. You're never lost.<br>Brian Smith: Awesome, awesome. I think that's a great way to end our conversation. That question—I want to thank you so much for being here and for what you do. I know you're very busy, and I know this is—you've got a lot of children and everything. You're very free with your book. So, tell people where they can find out about your book, where they can get it.<br>Cristian: Yeah, sure. So, at the beginning, you said that the book can be downloaded. It can't actually be downloaded for free, but it is available to be read for free online. If you just go to my website, awalkinthephysical.com, there's a book page. The third link down is a link to Google Books, where the whole book is available for free. Just click "Read for free" or something—I forget the button. But it's all there. It's also available on Amazon in print or Kindle version. And the audiobook is also available on Audible. Those are all for purchase. But I did record the audiobook, I guess, a year before last December. So, yes, all those forms are out there. <br>I think it's—it's not about the money. I just want people to be reminded of who we really are. No, like, I just—if you feel intuitively that it can help, please, you know, feel free to read the book. And if not, that's totally fine, too. If you'd like to email me, I try to make myself available. I've got a lot of emails lately, so I apologize if I can't respond. But the information for all that is on my website, awalkinthephysical.com. I also have a bunch of other talks that I've shared there as well. <br>As the last thing I'll say, I just want to say to everybody who's listening today, please be reminded: You are a loving, powerful, immortal, multi-dimensional being. You really are. And there is absolutely nothing to fear in this life. Whatever you're dealing with, whatever the hardship in your life is right now, please be reminded of who you really are and know that you are deep and powerful and loved so much. That there is nothing to truly fear. I just—I just feel like we need—that's the most important message we can share with each other.<br>Brian Smith: 100%. I, again, am so honored that you're here today. Thank you for what you do. I do want to—I know for you, it's not about the money. It's about the message. For me, I've read a few books that have really, really, like, changed my way of thinking. Yours is one of them. Listening to the interviews with you—so, I want to thank you for what you do.<br>Cristian: Thank you so much, Brian. I appreciate you having me on. Thank you.<br>Brian Smith: All right, enjoy your evening. Thank you. I'm excited to note—I have a great new resource. It's called GEMS: Four Steps to Move from Grief to Joy.

And when we respond in fear, we suffer a lot because we put all this negative meaning on our lives, and we reject what we're experiencing. You know, we feel a lot of pain. It's not about the limitation; the active ingredient is how we respond—like what we do with it, the quality of being that we bring into it and through it, like how we meet whatever has arisen.<br>Good.

Christian, welcome to the show.<br>Christian: Thank you, Christina. It's an honor to be here.<br>Christina: I'm so honored to have you here. Since I saw your first podcast, I couldn't wait to have a conscious conversation with you. So, with that being said, are you ready to get started?<br>Christian: Absolutely. Thank you.<br>Christina: So, Christian, when I heard your story about remembering your pre-birth experience, one of the things that really impacted me the most was when you described how you met this being, and there was some quality about that being, and you were curious. Once you learned that that being spent time on Earth, your soul said, "I really want to do that." That jumped out to me. I immediately felt that knowing who I am in this body, in this time-space Earth reality. <br>I immediately was like, "I know my soul did that too." And so, I think many of us do, even if we don't recall. I think many of us have been similarly inspired. In fact, I heard Bob Monroe, the famous out-of-body explorer, make a comment to that effect a while ago after I had shared it. I remember him saying that many of us come because we become inspired by a being who has come, and we see the potential and the expansion and the love and the joy that's within them, and we just say, "I want to do that." And that's so what I experienced. So, I love it. I love that he said that.<br>Christian: Yeah, yeah. And what impacted me most was that, you know, I've signed up for... I have had a lot of challenges in my life, mostly around addiction and being a single mom for 18 years. Those are my two big challenges. And many, many times, I have felt victimized by this planet. So, the reason—one of the main reasons—I wanted to talk to you was because it was so inspiring to hear that we choose to be here. Yeah. So, could you talk about that a little bit for me?<br>Christian: Yeah, we do choose to be here. And I know it can feel like we're victims when we're here because the level of constraint that we're dealing with here is very high. So, when I say that, what I mean is like, we feel separate from each other, and we feel bound by biology—what our biology limits us to—and all the constraints of the physical universe, like linear time and discrete location. <br>You know, these things that we think are so obvious, they're actually really alien to us. It's a very, very dense experience by comparison to be human. It's like wearing a heavy coat—like wearing a 500-pound coat or something. You know, and then once we're wearing this 500-pound coat, we say, "Oh my gosh, this is heavy." Right? It is. It can be heavy. Yeah. But the spirit is deeper than that. Like, we know from that perspective that the limitation is actually an opportunity. And so, that's why we come.<br>Christina: I love that. So, you said the limitation is an opportunity. Yeah, it can yield opportunity depending on how we respond to it. The key is... So, it's not that limitation itself causes an effect, and it's not that suffering is good or something like that. You know, because I think a lot of people kind of tie those things together, and then they think, "Oh, well, that means pain is good. I came here to suffer." No. It's just that when the limitations are high, we might respond in fear. <br>And when we respond in fear, we suffer a lot because we put all this negative meaning on our lives, and we reject what we're experiencing. You know, we feel a lot of pain. It's not about the limitation. The active ingredient is how we respond—like what we do with it, the quality of being that we bring into it and through it, like how we meet whatever has arisen. That is where the real quality is. You know, so when we talk about... I've used the analogy that being physical is like lifting weights on a weight bench. So, like, the action of pushing up the weights can mean a lot of different things, but the simplest way to put it is having a loving intention rather than a fearful intention. And love can mean so many things. It can mean perseverance when things are difficult. It can mean acceptance when something is really hard to accept. You know, it can mean choosing compassion in a situation where it's not easy to choose compassion. There's just so many things that it can possibly mean. <br>So, it's that the limitation is giving us that context, and I call it the counter-pressure of circumstance. You know, circumstances giving us this counter-pressure, we get to then pit ourselves into it and against it—you could say. I don't want to say "against" because it's not like the physical world is in any way adverse to us. There's no opponent. I just mean that we are able to shine who we really are in and through it by making choices and by bringing forth a certain quality of being. <br>And that's like... I saw you just put it in a metaphor. Like, you could say when you're sitting on your couch, it's really easy to, I don't know, watch Survivor, the show Survivor. You know, when people are out on the island, and they're starving, and they're having to do all these physically demanding challenges, and then vote each other out in this reality show, right? It's one thing to be on the couch. It's another thing to go there and starve and have to make choices. Physically incarnating is a little bit like that. You know, like, it's one thing to say, so to speak—I don't want to limit this too much with words—but it's one thing to say, "I am of joy, and I love you." It's another to actually be on the desert island starving. It's another to be here and be a single parent or to have someone... to be someone who has an illness or something, and then to see how you respond. You know, that's another thing.<br>Christina: Yeah. So, here's the long answer. No, it's okay. I love it all. There's so many different threads that I want to go with that. But what you just said about being with an illness or with some sort of limitation—I remember in your story, when you chose to come here, you saw like a blueprint or like a flowchart kind of of what that would be. So, do we know the limitations or the possibilities of limitations before signing up too?<br>Christian: Yes. So, yeah, we do. We do. What we see is the context—the full context. We have a really good view of the circumstances, the body, the parents, the society, and all the prediction of how that life might unfold. I use the word "prediction" because that's really what the pre-life review is. It's not set in stone. You know, it's not like you're reading a script now that you just have to go live out. It's not like that. It's that you start from a point of being incarnated and being born—actually, incarnation often happens before birth; it's actually pre-birth—but you start from this point, and then as you experience birth and growing up and getting older and going and making all these choices, there's so many things that might unfold. And the system is just really good at predicting that. <br>So, we can see the potentials. But what I reviewed primarily wasn't events. I mean, there were events in it. What was of primary interest is what it would be like to be me—like to have the experience of being Christian. You know, because really, what's going on here is you're having an experience, I'm having an experience, the person listening today is having an experience. And the nature of that experience is what's really going on. It's not so much about the events happening or the circumstances happening, but it's like, what does it feel like to be you? <br>You know, right? So, that was what I reviewed before. It was like, what would it feel like to be Christian, and what avenues might unfold, and how might it feel to be exactly in that place, like even right now, you know, all the way out this far into the life? What is it like? What does it feel like to be me? I don't know if that describes it well. So, we do see that ahead of time, and we see the opportunity that that affords. And we do sign up, even though part of that is forgetting that we did that.<br><br><br>Christina: Yes. I was just going to ask you because, you know, we're talking about you because you remember. And like, I don't remember. I resonate with everything that you say, and I just do know now that somewhere I had a similar experience. But you remember. So, what I was going to ask is, is that similar to all souls that decide to incarnate on Earth—or in Earth? I know you say there's no distance, so is it "on Earth" or "in Earth"?<br>Christian: It's that the Earth is appearing in us, actually.<br>Christina: Oh, I love that. Yeah. So, you just said Earth is appearing on the movie screen of your awareness. Your awareness already existed before, but anyway, not to get away from your question.<br>Christina: Yeah, yeah. No, I was just going to ask about that because, you know, we typically—and I know for myself, even though intellectually I have read so many things, I've meditated, I've had experiences—most of the time, I walk around believing that I am in my body. Yeah, that's normal.<br>Christian: Yeah, that's normal. But really, the body is occurring in our minds. Would you say that's correct, or how would you describe that?<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, the body—I don't want to specify it to the mind. The mind is the experience. The body is occurring in our awareness, in consciousness itself. So, as a very small tangent, but I just find this helpful—like today, if you lift up your hand and you spend a few moments closing your eyes and feeling the aliveness in your hand—I'm doing this because it's very tangible; it's very right now, right here—the aliveness in your hand. How do you know that you have a hand? <br>You can ask yourself that with your eyes closed, and you might feel like air moving across the surface of your skin. I don't mean that sensory experience; I mean the aliveness that's in your hand. Do you feel that aliveness? So, that aliveness—I won't go into a full exercise here—but if that aliveness is itself the living consciousness that you are, it was already there, and it doesn't have a boundary to it, actually. It doesn't have an edge. Like, if you investigate that aliveness closely, you'll find there's no edge. Right? There's the experience of an edge as wind blows across your fingertips, and you feel a bounding. I'm doing it actually right now. <br>Yeah. So, anyway, so what happens is—I mean, that's a very simple example, but I think it is actually really powerful because if you go far enough into that direction, there is what I will—I don't want to make this sound stimulating for the ego—but there is an inversion point where, if you go deep enough into it, all of a sudden, it all kind of flips around, and you can become very tangibly, experientially aware that the physical sensory data is occurring within you, and that your body of awareness is actually way bigger than the little sensory data. <br>But anyway, usually on Earth, as we walk around, we become deeply associated with the form—you know, with the sense data, the sight, the sound, the touch, and the thoughts, all the thoughts. And the more we focus on it, the more firm and real it is. And that's what the veil permits. The veil just permits us to kind of get lost in and focus deeply within the form. But like children, for instance, who haven't been here as long—you know, really young, young babies—they don't have as much form association yet, so they come and go a lot more freely. They're a lot more open to it. Usually, by the age of like, I don't know, four, five, six, something like that, you know, now you've got an identity. Your parents have told you who you are a few hundred times, and you've really started to focus into it. We all tend to do that.<br>So, back to your original comment, I did not remember the majority of my adult life. You know, I had no memory between the ages of six, approximately, and 30. My body's 43 right now, and when the memory returned to me, it was very like the most natural thing in the world. It occurred after I took up a long-term meditation practice, and I was able to—I was no longer so deeply associated with the form. I really deeply investigated that aliveness, that consciousness that is here now. And I didn't expect anything. It's just that once we go in that direction far enough, deeper aspects of our self rise up all on their own. Yeah.<br>Christina: Yeah. I don't know if that speaks to your question.<br>Christina: My original question—I don't actually have the information. Well, this might be a roundabout way of getting to the question, but so, you mentioned that you didn't remember from about five or six to the age of 30.<br>Christian: Yeah.<br>Christina: The other day—and we're all veiled, correct? Like, we're all veiled when we come here, so yes, we can be in this experience so we can be human.<br>Christian: Yeah, yeah.<br>Christina: So, the other day, my son and I—we talk about the truths of the universe, and we talk about God a lot, and what our purpose is here—and he asked me, "Why do we forget?" And I was doing my best to tell him what I think I know, and he said to me—he's eight—he said, "Wait, so you know how we don't remember much before we're three or four? Is that because we actually do remember, and then we learn all the things that humans learn on this planet?" And I thought, "Wow, my kid is so..." That's not a bad thought.<br>Christian: Yeah, yeah. The neurological system has to develop, and it's... So, you know, we start blank. Like, when I remember the day I was born, I had no understanding of what was going on at all. You know, so we start with like a blank slate as the human character, but we—the deeper us—is we are absolutely not a blank slate in how we arrive. You know, we—the soul—has a ton of experience it brings with it and arrives with. And yeah, so then the veiling allows you then to get lost in, so to speak, the human character, so that you can have the experience of just being that person and just having that experience and having the perspective of being that person and not the perspective of being all that is.<br>Christina: Yeah, yes. And I remember—I don't know if it was an interview that I saw from you sharing your story or if it was in your book—but I remember you sharing an experience about being three or four, and you just had this assumption that everyone could feel each other's feelings, and you were so excited. And it brought back a memory of when I was young, and my parents had friends over for dinner, and I just remember being so excited to jump into the conversation, and they all laughed at me, and I cried, and I ran.<br>Christian: Oh, yeah. Because you couldn't articulate yet, right?<br>Christina: And because I—I must have... I am an empath; I'm very sensitive, so I can feel a lot of what is around me. But I remember I was so excited to share it, like telepathically, with them.<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, it's telling because, in higher systems, it's just like that. You show up, you're excited, and you want to connect, and that automatically happens because intention—we're telepathically connected all the time. We still are telepathically connected, actually. It's just that most of us are quite unaware of it on a routine basis. So, I totally relate to what you're saying. <br>Yeah. And then, as a kid, you don't have the language yet to... You don't have—it takes a lot of practice to be able to then take all the thoughts and ideas and turn them into words and throw them at somebody else in a way that makes sense. Yeah, that's a very clunky way to interact.<br>Christina: Right. Yeah. So, okay, that brings me to another curiosity. You said we are all still telepathic. So, one of the things that as I started learning about my empathy—and you know, my kids—I start talking, and they're like, "Mom, how are you in my brain? How did you know I was thinking that?" And my answer is, "We're all one mind." But they think I'm psychic or a witch, and I'm like, "Well, we all have that capability."<br>Christian: Oh, yes, absolutely. No, it's the norm. When I say the norm, I mean—on Earth, it may not be the norm all the time, but as spiritual beings, in most higher systems, we tangibly feel and know our connection with each other and with the environment all the time. And so, telepathic exchange—that is the exchange of not only ideas but feelings—is just the natural, efficient way of interaction. <br>Like, if you want to—there's no room for misinterpretation when you're sharing exactly what you're thinking and feeling and intending, and they can see it, and you can feel them. You know, that's what we're kind of used to. And that includes information and data. So, now that we're on Earth, it's like—put it this way—we're still connected to the database. The database that's running the simulation is a part of us; it's a part of spirit. So, it's actually not far. It's not hard to reach. It's just that when we're veiled, we often are quite obscured from it because we're so focused on the clunky thoughts and the clunky sense data and the clunky everything—you know, the denseness. <br>Usually, that intuitive connection is very fast, very instantaneous, kind of comes in complete chunks. And it can be inexplicable. Like, you might know something that you have no conscious, on the human level, way to know that because you are connected to the information, to the source of it all. And it's quite normal. And then, if we develop close relationships with others—especially if the relationships are genuinely loving, in a real, genuine love—that's like an open bridge. <br>So, then telepathic exchanges can happen much more normally. Like, really close friends or—like last night, my wife and I were sitting in bed, and I was reading something, and then I just had this telepathic thought, like, "Would you scratch my back?" I didn't even ask it verbally, and she reached out and scratched my back. And she was reading something, and she just did it. And then I kind of laughed out loud, and she said, "Why did you laugh?" And I was like, "Well, because I just asked you to scratch my back, but I didn't bother to speak, and you still heard it." You know, so it's—anyway, so that kind of stuff does happen. Yeah, those are fun experiences.<br><br><br>Christina: I know that there's a lot more threads now that I want to go down, but you mentioned database and clunkiness. So, for listeners that might be not sure of who you are or new to some of this kind of content, can you explain what that means—the clunkiness?<br>Christian: Yeah, so, all we know is the physical, so it's hard for us to understand how this could be clunky, right? But in comparison to our higher states of being that are less constrained, everything here is very dense and slow and clunky. I don't know what other word to use, by comparison to the speed and rapidity and fullness of action that takes place in higher states. <br>So, maybe I don't know if this metaphor is going to be helpful, but like, if you imagine going to an IMAX movie theater and then going and watching a TV show on a 20-inch black-and-white TV screen, the black-and-white TV screen is much smaller, it's black-and-white, it can't convey nearly the same bandwidth of content. We get used to the black-and-white movie screen. <br>Being on Earth is like living in a black-and-white movie by comparison to the vividness and the realness of higher states. And so, this shift, this change, is not just in sensory data; it's in vibration. So, what I mean is—oh, this is hard to describe—our higher state is very open and connected, and our local state is very dense and firm, you could say. And so, it takes... For instance, on Earth, if we intend something, it does not automatically immediately happen. Like, if I intend right now to go to California, it's just—the odds of that happening are almost impossible. I'm not going to expect that; that's not how it works. But in thought-responsive systems—higher systems that are much more fluid—if you intend something, if you think something, it immediately happens. It immediately affects the environment, and it's real. Like, you can see it; I mean, it's very tangible. <br>So, here on Earth, it's still actually our intention and our thoughts that have an effect. It's just a lot slower, and there's a lot of us in the game. There's a few billion of us playing, at least just in the human roles, not to mention the other roles. And so, those intentions and those thoughts are building up thought momentum, and the thought momentum can translate into physical outcome, actually. It just takes time, usually.<br>Christina: I liked how you described that. I noticed that as I was listening, I had this vision of like everything I see in front of me—my laptop, the microphone—it's there's edges, right? Like you said before, what—almost like it just turned into nothing, like colors or, you know, like you said, vibration. And it was almost like a fuzzy TV screen or something where it wasn't so hard or firm, like you said.<br>Christian: Yeah, it's the firmness is not just definition of objects. That's a part of it, but the reason I say that is because in higher systems, you can experience objects that are even more real, more tangible, more colorful, more whatever. It's just that here, there is a density of vibration that has come to the—I don't know how else to describe it other than to say there are layers of preceding energetic action that have taken place that have to culminate in a lot to reach this level of density and to actualize. So, we're like engaged in a very, very—like, we're locked into a position while we're incarnated. And this locked-in position is very low vibration by comparison but also very powerful because we're locked into such a dense position. <br>And in that very dense position, when we make hard choices—you know, when we deal with the feelings, the emotions, the strong human emotions, and the thoughts that might arise—the very loud thoughts that can arise or the circumstances that are so persistent here—you know, like someone dies, and they're gone the whole rest of your life—super persistent. That's a very dense kind of constraint. Then now that you're locked into having to face and deal with those constraints, how do you respond then? You know, like, how do you respond if you have an illness that lasts not just a month but a year or not just a year but 10 years? After 10 years, how are you responding? You know, that level of persistence and consistency and density is one of the great values of Earth, you know, because now you really have to pick. Now you really have to decide how you're going to respond.<br>Christina: Yeah, I just really felt that "locked in" when you said that. I can't describe the feeling, but I felt it in my core—like, locked in.<br>Christian: Whereas locked in—or as locked in as we can get. I mean, that's like the technology of the veil—is that it allows us to lock into this very dense, high-opportunity position. And it's one heck of a ride, you know, for sure.<br>Christina: We're describing the black-and-white movie in the IMAX movie. So, I'm very deep into the work of A Course in Miracles and The Way of Mastery, and they often—they're channeled by Jesus—and they often depict the comparison that this is a movie. So, there's a couple pieces I want to ask you about here. One is that our choice is to tune into which movie we're going to be watching—the one that's led by ego or the one that's led by God. Do we actually—can you talk about free will and, you know, do we actually create our own reality?<br><br><br>Christian: We do create our own reality, both individually and collectively. And the collectively part is a big one on Earth. So, while we're human, we focus an awful lot on how the physical has actualized. We focus a lot on how the objects are placed today—you know, who's got what, who's doing what, what's the new image that's on TikTok, you know, whatever—who's leading this company today or who. We're really focused on those kinds of events. Okay, but the important thing is the quality of being with which we are meeting the objects that have arisen and what kind of decisions we are making in response. So, we can say that's called choice-making—you know, what choices do we make? But there's actually something that's taking place deeper than the choice itself, and that is intent—intention. It's the best word we have. <br>I just mean, at the deepest level, as a spiritual being, what is the what and why you are making the choices you're making today? What is the quality with which you are making your choices, honestly? You know, because you can't fool the universe. Like, you know, your actual motivations are your actual motivations. You can fool yourself—you know, well, you can at the ego level quite a bit. The deeper part of you, of course, knows it's still seen. So, what I mean is, what is that quality of intention? That's what this whole game is—is what is the quality of your intention with which you meet any given moment, any given choice? <br>Are you responding out of fear and rejection and ego that is trying to grab onto some power that seems to have been lost because now you feel separate from everybody else, and you don't have power, and now I've got to get some money, or now I've got to control this person next to me, or now I've got to belong to the right group or believe the right thing, you know, whatever? Or are we choosing to have patience with ourselves and others, compassion? <br>Are we choosing ownership, perseverance? You know, are we choosing to relate to the present moment in a way that is more in alignment with the love and the peace and the joy and the freedom of our true nature? Because our true nature is love and peace and joy and freedom. That is our true nature—always, always, always. No matter how deeply we get wrapped into the horror stories that we've created for ourselves on Earth, and no matter how much fear we have in response to the horror story we've erected, our true nature is always that love and that peace and that joy. So, can we make choices that are in alignment with that? <br>And when we do that, like, we feel joy. You know, we feel the freedom and peace. People say, "Well, how do you know if you're wielding an intention that's in alignment with love?" You'll feel it. You'll feel one step closer to freedom, one step closer to joy, one step closer to fullness of fulfillment. You'll feel fulfilled. You know, like, there's a deep satisfaction when you actually help the person next to you, when you actually love the person next to you, when you're on your own crap. Yeah, after decades of tormenting yourself or causing pain for others, when you finally look at your own fear and say, "Wow, I have a lot of fear," when you really face that and own that—you know, those are powerful moments. That's what we're here to do.<br>Christina: Powerful and electric intention. You can't trick your intention. And as soon as I read the title, I was like, "I felt like I got it already." But then after I read it, you know, I just really resonated with what you've said. We can't—you know, and I know if I look back through my life, when I was lying to myself or trying to trick myself, you know, because it wasn't ever ill intention; it was just I didn't know better.<br>Christian: Yeah, no, it's asleep. Egoic action is very largely unconscious.<br>Christina: Yeah. And then what I loved about your previous interviews and what I really wanted to talk to you about was the intention of love. And I think that you know, several times you've mentioned in your book and in other interviews that that is our purpose, and that is actually what got me to start paying attention. I was coming out of treatment for an eating disorder, and my treatment team said, "Go be around 12-step, go be around recovery, go find a church or a spiritual center."<br>And I opened up the calendar to one of these spiritual centers, and it said there was a group called "Real Love." I didn't look at the sermons; I wasn't going to go to those, but I saw "Real Love" was a group, and I had no idea what that was, but I was like, "That sounds like something I need." And that's what started everything. Well, I'm sure it started in treatment, but the book was Real Love by Greg Baer, and that's—for 14, 15 years now—it's been my intention to learn how to love unconditionally. So, can you talk about love a little bit on the other side here?<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, so when we talk about love, it's one of those things that's almost impossible to actually talk about. But when we talk about love, we tend to talk about the feeling, the emotion, and then we think about what type of love—like, you know, the Greek sets of seven or eight or however many different words for love—sorry, I don't remember, but there was like familiar love, romantic love, friendship love, and so on. When I use the word love, it's just the best word that we have. It means that which resonates with and aligns with our true nature. <br>Because our true nature—we are all one; we're all connected and a part of each other. We're all drops in the one ocean. Love is that which then is in alignment with the truth of that connectedness. It honors it; it celebrates it. Love is like a boundless celebration. It's the nature of life. It's lifting up the other and the beauty of creation and celebrating the beauty of existence itself—or not even needing a form but yet serving the other, not just as the self but as wonderful. I don't know how to describe it. Whereas fear is the opposite. I mean, it's not duality itself is transcendent, so I don't mean to make it sound like there's a true opposite called fear. <br>Fear is a non-native response. It's a response to a non-native set of limitations wherein we buy into a perception that's not in alignment with the truth. So, if we feel powerless, we feel fear because our true nature is very powerful. Or if we feel that we're not worthy of love, we feel fear, and then we do whatever we can to try to fill that hole. Or if we feel shameful or we don't have control—you know, all of these boil down to some of the root ones: not perceiving you have power or perceiving you're not worthy of love, and a few others. Anytime we bind to those perceptions that are not in alignment with who we really are, that can prompt fear precisely because we are losing ourselves in the perception of being something we're not. You see? <br>Now it's like, "I'm not loving; I'm not loved and amazing." And, "Oh my gosh, I'm disgusting; I'm gross." You know, and then we respond in fear. But I like to say that fear is just yet unevolved. It's just a synonym for that because it just means that there's a part of our experience here that we haven't yet fully integrated. When we fully integrate the experience, when we fully accept ourselves in everything we feel, when we fully feel it all—yes, when we do that, there is a profound expansion out to that point, and we discover the love and the peace and the joy that we really are never left. <br>We never ever lost it. We never lost it. But now we've gone out to this limitation—this circumstance, this relationship, this drug addiction, you know, whatever it is—and when we really integrate that and find who we really are in it and heal it, now we've expanded out to that point. The native love, the native joy, and the native freedom that you already are and never lost—like, we never ever ever lose that. So, back to your original point, love is what we are. It's just the description of what we really are. And in a lot of near-death experiences, people return, and they can't even put into words the absolutely profound depths of blissful love that exists. <br>There's just no way that we can possibly articulate it. It is absolutely unconditional. I know some people really get up in arms on that because they want to defend conditionality because of beliefs, but there's no—it's completely unconditional. Yeah, love is an unconditional acceptance and lifting up and empowering of the other—the apparent other.<br>Christina: Yes. I love that you just brought that into the conversation because one of the practices I've been doing—I'm doing A Course in Miracles; I'm doing all the lessons all over again. So, there's 365 days of lessons, and a lot of the first part of those lessons is, you know, I guess ingraining in our minds—I don't know, imprinting—that everything's neutral, and that's what we put meaning into everything that we see. <br>And I know you've talked about that. I was just going to say that I feel like one of A Course in Miracles' great strengths is that it is attempting to—so, I personally feel like sometimes the language is difficult to understand, and sometimes perhaps even less helpful because of the very specific meaning of some of the language. But anyway, overall, I find it to be a valuable exercise in re-relating yourself to form—form meaning sensory data, thoughts, objects, ideas—because, like you said, it is all neutral. Like, when you're a baby, and you know, babies are just—they don't have any meaning tied to it; they're just experiencing sensory data, and they don't even know what it means yet, right? You can locate how deeply you are associated with form if you whisper your name to yourself. <br>You'll notice this very strong pull to identification with your name. You're not your name. You're not even a human. You're not male or female. You're having the experience of being this name and being this human who is male or female. And so, A Course in Miracles can be really helpful because it is very helpful to spend actual time—we have to take linear time to practice, to do these practices, to practice meditation, and to locate your own relationship with form. And then, when you do that, what happens is—not because you're trying, but as your relationship with form changes and as you open, larger parts of yourself and of the truth just can rise up on their own. Like, all of a sudden, you might feel this amazing peace, and it's like—and as soon as you do, you know, the ego is like, "Oh my God, that was amazing. How did I do that? That was amazing. I've got to get that; I've got to grab that again." <br>It tries to grab onto it. I know—cling. Got to cling. I understand. But that's okay. You know, that's okay. So, if we notice the neutrality of the form, then there is the space that we create for that bliss and that joy to arise. All form actually is neutral—even pain. I know that's really hard, but like, I remember the last time I had the stomach flu. I really—there's certain—I'm very sensitive; I'm a very sensitive person. There's a lot of the human limitations that have been difficult for me to fully accept. And one of those things is being nauseated or vomiting. <br>I'm not a fan of that. I don't think anybody is, but I really don't like it. So, the last time I had the stomach flu, I was laying on the floor in my bathroom, and I just tried to really identify the sensation itself. Like, I don't need to reject this; I don't need to resist this. And then I noticed—not this is not a disassociation; actually, it's actually a move away from this. It's a full awareness, full alertness. I noticed that, in full alertness, even the sensation of vomiting was just—it was happening. <br>It was neutral. It didn't need to be a source of suffering. And there's actually a—oh, I don't know how to describe this without making this sound improper—but like, there's actually a joy beneath all experience—even painful experience. It's the resistance that hurts. I'll just say it's the resistance that hurts. It's the meaning that we put on it. It's a rejection of ourselves or of somebody else that hurts. "I'm not good enough unless I look a certain way, unless I do a certain thing, or unless I respond a certain way." No, no, no, no, no. That's not true. You are a beautiful, powerful being, and all you have a choice then in how you respond to all the neutrality—all the neutral, dense but neutral form that has arisen in the physical experience.<br><br><br>Christina: Yeah, I love how you describe that. So, one of the things that I do is I facilitate authentic relating modalities. I'm not sure if you're familiar, but one of them is called Circling, and what we do is just explore what it's like to be us in the body, in the room, in the present, without labeling it. And a couple of months ago, I was playing basketball with my son and my daughter, and I'm really competitive, so I was really into it, and I sprained my ankle—like, really, really bad. <br>And I was resisting until I was sitting there, and I noticed that where my ankle was, it just felt like this big ball of pain. I went into the pain, and it was a big ball, and it felt like kind of mushy, and it was such a crazy experience because it hurt—my body said it hurt really bad—and I had to crawl around. It was a really bad sprain. And what was that ball made of? It was like energy. It felt—I don't feel it now, so it's hard, but I noticed it was like a puffiness that, you know, kind of almost like it was protecting my ankle in a weird way. And so, yeah, I just loved how you described that because that's what one of the things that I know gave me a lot of relief when I started learning the truth of who I am was that, "Oh, if we put meaning into this, and my thoughts are creating my feelings, and my feelings feel like they're suffering," yeah, well, that's a little bit of freedom, a little bit exactly.<br>Christian: Oh, yeah, no, and then that rabbit hole goes very deep because we really are incredibly free, but we have put a ton of meaning on the physical. And then what happens is, the ego even tries to justify its lack of control. You know, like, "No, no, I don't have power because that means that I actually have to—there's some reason that I have my egoic excuses." Well, that's why quality of intention is so important because we have to have the willingness—we don't have to, but we may choose or may not choose if we wish—the willingness to acknowledge the quality with which we're even making that choice. Like, as an example, some people are afraid of success. <br>I know it sounds crazy, but some people don't want to—for whatever reason, it might be fear of failing, so they don't want to succeed because then they can't lose the thing they fear to get—you know, to lose whatever it is. At the bottom of all of our little games we play within ourselves, you know, where is the fear? And that's why it's so powerful to directly find and face our fears. <br>You know, and find that when we go into them, ultimately, it may feel really terrifying. I'm not making light of the depths of fear. I'm here to face fear. I do not make light of it. But when we really go into that closet—I use this metaphor in my book, and I've shared it before, but I'll just share it super quickly—when my father was a little child, a kid, he would lay in his bed, and he would look at this closet in his bedroom every night, and he was terrified of the monsters in the closet. And every night, he had problems falling asleep, and he was just—he lost his peace over these monsters in the closet. <br>One night, he said, "You know what? Screw this. Enough's enough. I'm going into that closet. I'm going to find those monsters because I'm sick of being afraid." And he charged into the closet, and he felt through the clothes, and he sat on the floor, and he expected that he would be eaten, but nothing happened. There were no monsters in the closet. Right? So, today, as an adult, my father is not afraid of closets. Now, I know that sounds silly, but our fears are like that. We torture ourselves for years, resisting something, and then when we eventually go into the closet and really go in there and really feel everything, we find there was nothing ever ultimately to be afraid of. This is the place where we can test that to the extremes, man.<br>Christina: Yeah, the extremes. I love that. One of my first sponsors told me this, and so I've been sober from drugs and alcohol for—it'll be 10 years in December—December 7th.<br>Christian: Congratulations.<br>Christina: Thank you. Yeah, talk about miracles—they are real. She said to me, "You know, you're just going to the edge of fear to see it isn't real." And like, I'm so grateful that I had her as my first sponsor because the learning that I got, I've taken that with me everywhere. And I live in Phoenix, Arizona, in a desert. So, just about a month ago, there was a scorpion in the house. My daughter was like, "Whatever, we're going after it. If I get stung, I've already been stung, but looking at it—I don't care about being stung; that doesn't scare me. I can handle pain." But looking at it, and so we both used it as an opportunity to go to the edge of fear to see it isn't real. And you know, we felt everything in our—I mean, that was like the most contrast I have felt in a long time.<br>Christian: That's wonderful. Yeah, it's amazing how even a small—I mean, a relatively small stimulus—we really can use it. Now, we're not saying go get yourself stung by a scorpion. That's not what we're saying. Yeah, but even that—like, I mean, it could be something silly like—this is another very silly example, and this is just personal, but it's the kind of thing that—like, a year so a few years into my awakening, as I was really waking up to my relationship with form, one night, I was standing at my toilet urinating, and I realized I was afraid of the feeling. <br>And there was no reason to be afraid, so I went into—but it's okay; there is a reason because I feel afraid. There's something. It was—and this sounds simple, but it was—I didn't really have control over the sensation. I mean, obviously, I could stop urinating if I wished, but that's not what I meant. I meant the feeling itself. Yeah, I didn't have control over the fan—like, at the very—this is such a simple, basic human experience, but yet it's dense. You know, everything that we do here is a density to it. So, I'm just saying that any simple interaction with form, we can use in that way.<br><br><br>Christina: That's really cool. And then it's interesting because then, like, the scorpion tends to respond differently. Yeah, whatever it is—whatever the scorpion is, whatever it is. So, the thing is, I actually didn't see it. I saw a piece of fudge, and then my daughter saw it, and it ran under my bed. And we were going to bed, so like, I had way too much fear. There was no way I was going to sleep with that under there. So, we—you know, so I was like, trying to call a friend, but it was 10 o'clock at night. I had no one to come over, and so she was like, "All right, I'm going to help you. If I get stung..." And what I love about this is the quality of—you know, and this wasn't always the case for me—but you know, playing with the opportunities, the challenges, the things that do arise in our life as ways to experience. Right? That's what we're here to do—is experience.<br>Christian: Exactly. And it is like a big playground. It's like a big playground with apparently sharp objects in it. You know, it's a big playground. We—our true nature is so playful. We're just such playful, fun-loving beings at heart. Yeah, children are like that before they get conditioned out of it. Right? <br>We're all like that. Like, we're deeply playful, and this whole thing is kind of like, "Let's see how far we can take this creativity thing to the next level and really be dense and really get old and really have disease and really see what we can do with it." And it may not seem fun to the human ego at times. I'm not making light of the difficulties. I'm just saying that the spirit that has given rise to form is playful, and we can use all the form as like a big playground.<br>It's amazing when you lose your fear—well, maybe not lose yourself—it's amazing when you've processed fear and really come to meet reality in a state of alertness. How much everything becomes a beautiful playground. It's amazing. Like, things that otherwise would not seem magical all of a sudden—there's magic everywhere. Yeah, like, it's amazing.<br><br><br>Christina: Yeah, that's been something recently that you know, my kids are actually joining me in it, so I'm super amazed and happy that they play along when they're with me. You know, they have to—they go to a different household, so I don't know what happens there, but you know, it's more like—not that I'm never going to be afraid, but that when I notice I feel afraid, that's an opportunity to get present to, "Oh, what's happening? You know, what's the message? What's the messenger?"<br>It feels like a messenger. It's like, "Hey, you have a perception that's not in alignment with the truth." And you're like, "Ah, man, I really do. What is it?" You know, and you can go find it. I noticed it can be sneaky, though. My kids—so, I'll—you know, I've been—I'm more relaxed now than I used to be, but I can be very OCD. And so, my son loves playing soccer, basketball, so he'll kick the ball around, and sometimes it'll hit things, and I'll say, "Liam, keep it on the ground." And he'll tell me—he'll say, "Mom, isn't that your ego being afraid that something's going to get broken?" <br>Oh, yeah. And I was willing to go that route. I can understand that. I mean, I feel like, you know, sometimes I respond in that way too, of course. And yeah, I feel like—I mean, part of it is prudence, like, you're trying to be prudent and right. So, finding that line—and I don't—but that's good. I mean, that's wonderful that he does. I mean, I feel like none of us should ever be afraid to have a question. You know, "Are you—is that a New York response?" And it's okay. Like, notice that the ego will immediately be like, "Oh, no, it's not an ego." It's okay if you're having an ego response. It's totally fine. You know, if you look at yourself and say, "Oh, okay, yeah, thank you."<br>Christian: Yeah, yeah. So, even that—like, one of the things that has been in my awareness lately and in the world is not to try to deny ego or push it away but rather to take that playfulness into, you know, when you're recognizing it's the ego or things to that effect. That's beautiful. Ego is—because the ego's not something separate. It's not like some separate structure that you're trying to get rid of and beat down with a stick. That's not how it works. It's just the part of it's you—yeah, when responding in fear—that's all. And having built up some structure as a response.<br>Christina: Yeah. I'm curious because I've heard and read some similar but also—it's just my own understanding or lack of understanding. So, is the ego an illusion, or is it something we created? Like, I get stuck on that sometimes. What would you—?<br>Christian: Yeah, so the way that I use ego is the portion of the self that is responding in fear. I don't mean ego as in the existence of a separate human personality, which is how some people use the term. So, all form is not fundamental, including thoughts, emotions, patterns of the mind, including ego structures. Those are all not fundamental. They're all made of the stuff that is fundamental, though, which is consciousness, spirit. That's real. It's the most real thing. <br>And then it loses itself in experiences of form for a while, but the realness of spirit endures and then has an experience of form. So, now I feel that it's important to not say that the experience itself isn't real. I know that some teachers say, "Oh, none of this is real." Well, it's like when you go to sleep at night, and you have a dream. When you wake up in the morning, it's pretty obvious now in your awake state that that was just a dream. It wasn't really real, but something did happen.<br>The thing that happened is you had an experience. And that is what's happening on Earth. It's like we're asleep in the dream of form, and we're having an experience. And then when we wake up, we realize, "Oh, I wasn't the human character." Yeah. And if the human character has an ego pattern, okay, you weren't really that either, but did you have an experience of being a human and wielding an egoic intent? Yeah, you had an experience. I think that's the best way I would—<br>Christina: Yeah, I love that. And you mentioned dream. I'm 43 years old too. I'll be 44 next week—week and a half. This life—even though it's a dream—like, we go to bed at night, and the dreams feel like a few seconds, right? We wake up. So, our experience in this firmness and this denseness is that what makes it feel so long? And really, what I've heard is like, it's just like a blink.<br>Christian: Yeah, yeah. You could say that the linear time itself is a part of the denseness. And linear—so because of that, the experience—our experience of linear time can seem very long. I personally feel like this life has gone on for a ridiculously long time. Like, I know it sounds silly, but I feel like instead of 43 years, it feels like 43,000 years. That's how long it feels to me that I've been in this journey. <br>Yeah. From the other perspective—that where we move closer to transcendent, you know, the—because we transcend linear time, our true nature transcends linear time. Then from that perspective, yes, it can seem like the blink of an eye. But once again, though, that timeless self has the experience of knowing length of time and knowing sequence. It gets a little—you could say linear time is like a way of knowing sequence or experiencing sequence.<br><br><br>Christina: Yeah, that's a really interesting topic to get into—time. Like, I don't even know how to ask what I'm wanting to know right now, but when you mentioned sequence, it's like in this life, it's like we take one step and then another step, so it appears like it's sequential, but you know, when we access—when we get present and we access that now-ness, is that how is that to like the truth of what time actually is?<br>Christian: Yeah, that's a step towards the truth. So, time can feel different—very different. Sometimes meditation can feel like—if you're really meditating, it can feel like a very long time, very short time, both. But you were highly alert the whole time. It's not like when you fall asleep, and you're not alert. <br>A state of meditation is one of alertness—it's a beautiful alertness—and yet time moves differently because you are no longer focused into the radio channel of linear time. Not that you're trying to do that. You don't sit down and say, "Okay, I'm going to leave linear time now." Right? It's not how it works. It's just that as you focus away from this channel by focusing on your awareness itself, which already transcends the channel, you may step—you may automatically step beyond, at least somewhat, the linear time experience. Because, like I said, linear time is an experience; it's not really a thing.<br>Christina: Yeah, I like how you do that. It's everything here is an experience more than it is actual objects. Got it.<br>Christina: Well, I do notice that for a while, and I do have some questions. Sure, of course. So, the first question that I wanted to ask you specifically is, how would you define spirituality?<br>Christian: Yeah, okay. So, spirituality is about one's relationship to the present moment, and it's a very alert seeking of what is actually real. I think there's two main ideas about what spirituality means. So, what I mean is—I'll start with the second one. What is actually real means go investigate objectively what is your awareness itself beneath thoughts. You just go look—don't make anything up, no stories. <br>You don't have to make anything up. Be a scientist about it. You know, go explore and investigate. What am I underneath the—don't settle for thoughts. More thoughts will immediately come up. Your mind will say, "Oh, well, it must be a form; it must be this; it must be some idea." Go deeper. You know, find—go investigate. And so, spirituality is actually a move away from the illusion and the dream of form, which can never fully articulate the answers. The truth of being is always what you are, so it's always available to you. Yeah.<br>Christina: You know, there's so many ideas or made-up constructs about what spirituality is, and so I love hearing the truth about what spirituality actually is.<br>Christian: Yeah, and then the first one—it's about your relationship to the present moment. So, that is—how are you using this? Well, how are you—what are you doing? Who are you right now? Like, I love—there's a Bashar quote that I love: "Circumstances don't matter; only state of being matters." And that's so powerful. It's not just this abstract thing; it really is incredibly powerful. So, spirituality is about refining that quality of being towards love and past fear. You know, that's really what all the—so then, you know, people of course say, "Oh, but I really benefit from a system—a belief system, an action." That's fine; that's good. <br>ou know, we're physical; we're being as a form right now. So, where we are in form, we often benefit from form. You know, we can pursue a tradition; it's important to have time set aside for a spiritual practice. That's all important. It's just that spirit is much bigger than—transcends the form itself. It operates through form, but it isn't the form. The form isn't the name of the game. It's not what you believe specifically that's going to be the active ingredient. <br>That was like one of the main things Tom Campbell said back in the day—13 years ago—that kicked me down my awakening path. You know, like, it's not your belief itself that is going to be the active ingredient. What—how do you use belief? How do you use belief? What do you believe and why? You know, because many people use belief because it's terrifying not knowing. That's okay. When you're ready, it's okay to walk off that cliff and say, "I don't know. I don't know." It's amazing how many answers are there when we're ready to do that.<br>Christina: Yeah, so I told you—I don't know if I did it while we were recording—but I have been using your book as an oracle, and today the message that I opened up to was "Thinking as Distinguished from Being." And I highlighted, "The only things that separate you from the native transcendence are the thoughts, judgments, and beliefs that you have decided to cling to and formalize over a lifetime." Yeah, so I love that. It circled right back to how I started my day.<br>Christian: That's wonderful. Yeah, I know that's not simple because we really get deeply associated with the form. We take it really personally. You know, I understand. It's just that there isn't ever anything actually separating you from the fullness of who you are, and there is incredible joy in that.<br>Christina: Oh, one other thing that I just felt strongly nudged to mention—the—okay, sometimes when we think about the action of moving away—it's not even an action, but I'll use the word action—sometimes when we think about the action of moving away from form towards the transcendent or from form towards awareness itself, we feel like we're going towards nothing.<br>It's like there's nothing there. Like, when you first start meditating, and you sit down, and you're like, "Oh my gosh, I have so many thoughts. I have to pay the bills; I've got to feed the dog; I've got to do the things." And then as you focus on something neutral or as you focus on the breath, and you take time, and you go, and you spend time, you go deeper into that. At first, it can feel like you're going towards nothing—like away from something which is real and towards nothing which is not real. But this is very important. <br>Oh my goodness, that awareness itself which transcends all form is full, not empty. Yeah, it's full of life, and it's full of tons of other form. So, some people who meditate a lot actively—and they're ready—they may experience out-of-body experiences. I know I've had out-of-body experiences—very eye-opening experiences. And when you have these experiences, they are not subtle. It's not like a little wishy-washy dream. It's like an IMAX movie in comparison to a black-and-white television. <br>And that was always there, and it's actually incredibly fun. Yeah, but I'm just mentioning that because it seems at first like you're moving towards nothing when you're so deeply associated with dense and clunky form, but when you put down the dense and clunky form, things may rise up that are not nothing. They could—I could say there are other realities of form within our being, and they can be engaged as well, even as our beingness itself transcends all realities of form.<br>Christina: Yeah, yeah. I loved how you said like—it's not really the word because I know that words don't really explain a lot of this stuff, or they can't actually describe it because everything is beyond words. But when you said it feels like we're moving towards nothing, it reminded me of some interviews that I've watched you in and things that I've experienced and read that there's nowhere actually to go, right? There's no distance. We're already here. Can you speak to that a little bit?<br>Christian: Yeah, just so—distance. When I say there's no distance, what I mean is the experience of distance is happening, but distance—physical distance itself is an illusion. It's not real. It's like logging into a video game. If you sit down and log into the World of Warcraft, and you're walking around Ironforge—you know, the name of a city in that game—there's—you're not—it's not really there. <br>You know, it's occurring on the screen, and it's in a computer. You can't go find Ironforge in the computer; it doesn't exist. So, the physical world is like that. It's an experience of sensory information that's arriving on and in your consciousness itself. And so, when you really—and so even believing in the distance helps the distance be real. Like, if you assume, "I'm trapped in my body; I have to get out if I want to have an out-of-body experience. I have to get out of this physical thing. I can see it; I can touch it. I need to escape this physical thing." Even that assumption is not super helpful because you are lending credence to the realness by believing it. In fact, the thing that's real is consciousness itself, and that consciousness itself is a part of the one great consciousness—the one mind, the source.<br>It's all one consciousness; it's all connected. And we are always connected to it all the time. So, then when we go look at a sunset, so thinking all the time is like looking at a sunset and thinking while you're doing it, and you're not experiencing peace because you're thinking about this person who was mean to you at the office today. But when you fully let go and really, with alertness, be present with the sunset, you may feel the aliveness and the connectedness that is in the sunset, but it's your being. See, like, the sunset is in you. It's like a part of you, and you are marveling at the beauty of what is, and what is is occurring within you. It's a beautiful thing.<br>Christina: Yeah, I love the way you describe that. And that reminds me—it actually leads right into my next question. I remember reading or listening—probably both—to when you felt like the sun and when you were coming into this life as Christian, and you were afraid, and you felt what he would call God. How would you—I know words aren't going to do great justice—but how would you define God?<br>Christian: That's the hardest question. So, there are no words at all. We only can use metaphors. God is the sentient, loving, conscious foundation of all things—both personal and impersonal. God is the ocean of all that is, of which you are a drop—your soul being one inseparable drop of God. God is the most close friend and lover and parent and beyond all those things—the substance and the great "I Am" of all things. <br>The great "I Am" of all things or the source—I think would be the simplest ways to try to describe that we call God. But I could just say it's the thing that's most familiar to all of us. Like, we're all running around trying to find God every day. We might not call it that. You know, like, we're trying to fill this hole. We feel separate from each other; we feel powerless; we feel unworthy of love, and we've got to earn the love; we've got to fix the problem. We're all seeking that bliss of oneness that we already have with God. Yeah, I don't know what other words to use.<br>Christina: Yeah, I love how you said that though. It's what we're searching for all the time. So, whenever we're—when I got sober, it was step two: "Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity." And in that step, I had to redefine God from the way I was brought up to believe. And since then, my coaches, my sponsors, my mentors—whoever I'm working with—they got me to see that anytime I want to reach for anything external, all I'm really wanting is God. Yeah.<br>Christian: So, one thing also that's beautiful—one synonym we can use for God is unconditional love and an absolutely unfathomable wisdom. So, I'm putting it that way because this thing that we're seeking is very much alive and real to each of us—the most familiar thing to each of us, the most holy thing to each of us. That one of the hardest parts about sharing my experience is it's so personal. <br>You know, it's like pulling down my pants. That's how I feel. But I'm not going to be afraid of that. You know, it's what we all are. It's just that that relationship is so holy. Yeah, and so real that it's—I feel like it's blasting me to even try to speak to it right now. But we all know that. You know, we all have that connection deep down. We all have that. You know, in Christian terms, we all have that relationship. I don't tend to use the word "relationship" because that implies it's totally something else, and you're over here, and it's over there, and you've got to relate with it. It's kind of like that. It is that, but it's also not that because you are it. It's your deepest nature.<br><br><br>Christina: All right, my next question—I think we might have already talked about this, but probably in a different way. So, what would you say, having your experiences and your knowledge and your wisdom and just who you are—what would you say is the purpose of life?<br>Christian: Yeah, the purpose of physical life is the expansion of love and joy through the experience integration that occurs through integrating experience and through choice-making—through learning and growing—not intellectual learning, learning of the being—to choose love rather than fear. <br>So, it's an expansion of love and joy through the growth and actualization of love and the integration of all the perspectives and situations and roles that beautifully occur on Earth—like to be you as a human and as a woman or a man and as an American or a Chinese person or as whatever—as a child or as an older person—whatever you are, whoever you are. All these forms to experience being that exactly that today and how do you respond to that? And then that experience—it becomes and is very precious to the soul. You know, the soul treasures like more than gold. <br>You know, the precious experiences it's been able to have, the perspectives it's had, the relationships you've been able to build, the love that you've been able to create and foster and share. Oh, it's more precious than gold. Love is—you could just say very simply—love is the reason.<br>Christina: Cheers that for a minute. It can be so beautiful. Like, I just felt that so deeply.<br>Christian: Yeah, when you said love is the gold, it just hits my heart.<br>Christina: I know. It's sacred. It's sacred. Well, and it just—you know, when I hear you speak and others, and it's just—you know, we're not here to become a CEO. We're not here to, you know, whatever these life—these are that equal success. Like, that's not it. And so, we can if we want, but yeah, that's not it.<br>Christian: As part of the playground, but I just love it when I hear and feel the truth. So, thank you.<br>Christina: Yeah, that reminds me of a near-death experience. I've quoted this so many times, and I forget whose it was, and I'm sorry for that. But there was a near-death experience I read where this individual had their life review, and they remembered they saw an experience going down to this river as a child when their parents stopped at a rest stop, and they had a bucket of water, and their parents had asked them to bring water to the car. <br>And when they filled the bucket of water, they noticed a dry tree out of the way, and they went over and watered the tree and then brought the rest of the bucket to their family. And they never thought anything of it, but it was such a celebrated moment of their life because it was just a loving act. There was no benefit to the person. It was just—they, you know, they, in fact, had to go out of their way a little bit to water this tree. And that is so important. You know, the small stuff is the big stuff. The small loving things—the moments when we face our fear and own our crap, the moments when we really are acting in kindness or simple joy—just like, let's say you've had a long, difficult day, and you know, there's someone playing outside. <br>Do you go play with them? Yeah. You know, that's the beauty. It's not about how many objects we've moved around or how much money we had. Like, this—none of that's going to—it's like accumulating gold in the World of Warcraft. It's not going to mean anything when you're outside of the game. But what is of great value is who you are. You know, because who you are laughs and endures and actually shines far brighter past the end of the physical. Who are you today? You know, that's the real question. That's the real opportunity.<br>Christina: The final question—because whether I'm coaching or making content on TikTok or now in this podcast, I always want people—whoever's listening—to walk away with bits of information. And I'm sure that this entire conversation, there's so many nuggets that we could pull apart. But this final question—if you could take one piece of wisdom that you have now to your younger self—the one after between six and thirty when you were so veiled—what would that be?<br>Christian: Well, so that's tricky because if I revealed to my younger self what I'm now aware of, I would not have had the opportunity to do what I came to do. So, I'm not certain how to answer that. But in general, one piece of wisdom that I think is important to share is there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of. Like, we are—we actually are powerful, multi-dimensional beings having a human experience. Like, we are—it's not just a religious thing, a mythological thing, a nice—I know it may seem at times like a nice far-off dream or something. <br>We really are multi-dimensional beings having a physical experience, and in our true nature, there is absolutely nothing to fear. I think that's just so important to remind each other of every day here, whether we believe or we don't. Like, it's not about that; it's who we are. So, it's who we are.<br>Christina: Yeah, so thank you so much for being here and spending this time with me today. If someone wants to get in touch with you, how can they go about finding you?<br>Christian: Yeah, sure. So, I have a website: awalkinthephysical.com.

And that's one of the reasons why, when we're on the other side choosing to come to do some incredible things here, we know who we really are. We know we are immortal beings. We really are. It's not just in our religious or spiritual thing—it's just what we are. And when we know that, there's nothing to fear. Fear can only happen when we buy into the illusion of the separation and the resultant beliefs and labels that we put on the experience after that illusion has been taken on.<br>Welcome to the "I Don't Believe in Astrology" podcast, the podcast dedicated to conscious souls looking to change the world. Astrologer by day, climate activist by night—here is your host, Deborah Silverman.<br>Deborah Silverman: So, welcome to the Deborah Silverman "I Don't Believe in Astrology" podcast. I just think the name is so funny. It makes me happy. And I'm imagining, having heard that you've never had your chart done before, is that true?<br>Christian Sundberg: Yes, that's true.<br>Deborah: And have you an opinion about astrology? Have you, one way or the other, had a thought process about it?<br>Christian: I don't have a deep opinion in either direction. I'm open to it, but I don't pay particular attention to it.<br>Deborah: Yeah, me neither. Just kidding. Just kidding. Okay, so I'm just going to start by saying that Christian is a double Aries. He probably didn't know that, with Moon in Virgo, which we'll go more into detail, but you don't need to know astrology to understand this conversation. So, let me just begin by... I want to say this to you—this is very important. Upon my watching many of your interviews, my life changed. And I'm sure people tell you this, but I want to specifically address this. I'm also a psychotherapist, as well as being an astrologer, so I work a lot with people psychologically. <br>And what I see in the unconscious of our collective zeitgeist is the distaste for being human. While people can't speak to that directly because it's blasphemy in a funny way—it's inappropriate to speak to it—it lives inside all of us with a resistance or a lack of commitment or ambivalence. It shows up in many forms where the human experience has this underbelly that you can't say out loud, which is, "This is the strangest planet." Beautiful. I give voice to it. And what you did for me was... it's been with me since I was very young because, unlike many of us but similar to you and I, I also have had direct encounters with the parts of myself that exist beyond this physical place. <br>So, I came in with that, and as a result, I have suffered throughout my whole life with this one line: "I just want to go home. I just want to go home." And when I caught myself saying it so many times as a young person, I caught myself during an eclipse about seven years ago, and I was like, "Deborah, we're not saying that anymore. You're here. Unpack." And what your sessions did, listening to you, is you validated that feeling I was living with secretly, but more importantly, you had me unpack. Excellent. I really want to speak to that.<br>So, for those of you listening, this could sound a little abstract. And this man is very grounded. He has three planets in Virgo. We're going to talk about practicality. He's a project manager for a nuclear... can you tell us what you do in your day job?<br>Christian: Yeah, so previously—for now, I have a new job—for the last nine months, I've been a project manager for an insurance company, managing a data migration project. But before that, I spent 16 years working for a nuclear valve manufacturer as a project manager for nuclear valve manufacturing projects.<br>Deborah: Now, if that's not Earth, I don't know what is. So, Earth—very Earth. So, I want you to know that he—and you'll see this very quickly—that in his chart, there is an ample amount. You have four planets in Earth. There are four elements in our system, and one of your primary ones is fire. So, that's the enthusiasm with which you carry this memory. So, we're going to repeat the story. I'm going to encourage you all to go watch his earlier podcast and get his book, which is called A Walk in the Physical, which I purchased. It's going to assist you. But today, what I really want to do is start with the classical favorite question of, "You were a traditionally normal human." Is that even true? Or none of us are humans?<br>Christian: That's a good point.<br>Deborah: But until your Saturn return—it was 29, 30—is that when the door went off? When the lights came on?<br><br><br>Christian: So, yeah, I was at the age of 30 when I began to go through my awakening, and the pre-birth memory began to return. My body is 42 right now, so about 12 years ago.<br>Deborah: So, let me just start with—in astrology, at the age between 28 and 30, there's something called Saturn return, which you've probably never heard of.<br>Christian: No.<br>Deborah: So, Saturn return happens every 29 to 30 years. I'm just going to show you quickly before we dive in. So, this is what a chart looks like. This is literally at the moment of your birth—where were the planets? Here's your birth date, the time, and the place. And this is literally here was the sun because you were born right at sunrise. Here's the sun coming up over the horizon. Here's the moon—tells me what sign it's in. And here's Saturn. This is the planet in astrology that describes destiny. <br>And at 28 years old—so it goes like this—you were born with it. Saturn was here. It took 28 to 30 years to go all the way around the heavens and come back to where you were born. At 30 years old, it returns, and this is called Saturn return in astrology. It's the activation of our purpose.<br>So, I just found that astounding that you're... so, I'm going to leave that for just a minute. I want to show my astrology audience here is his sun in Aries. He's also Aries rising because he's born right at dawn, so the sun was just rising. That makes a double Aries. And he has four planets in Earth, which is that project manager detail. He's got the detail guide. Okay, I'm going to leave that for a moment. <br>Now, if you would, I'm going to hand the mic to you. You're 30 years old, and what is the instigating? What's the activation that happened? How did this go from not knowing much about spirituality to suddenly having a direct experience with the other side?<br>Christian: Yeah, no, that's a great question. So, before I comment on it, I'll just disclaim, as I do whenever I share this, that words cannot do justice to these topics. I think most of your listeners are probably aware of this, but it is really important that we identify that human language is very limited. It is symbols. <br>Words are symbols of our local world and based in our local world's assumptions, whereas our true nature fully transcends the context of Earth. So, I just have to say that upfront because the language is like so crude. It's all we got right now while we're sharing physically. It's actually not all we have. We have non-physical exchanges all the time, but audibly, we have to throw words around, and they're very limited and limiting.<br>Deborah: And can I just say one thing? You have only one planet in air. So, in astrology, there's water, air, Earth, and fire. Water is our sensitivity—you've got plenty of that. Earth is our practicality—Mr. Project Manager. And fire is your enthusiasm. You have nothing in air, and air is words. So, your nature is to want to embody things and be the concrete example of it rather than this. But here you are on a podcast, and how many have you done of these?<br>Christian: Quite a few. I'm happy to share.<br>Deborah: Now, so you're right—words are not the highest level of our communication skills, but what's what we do down here. They're not that's what we do.<br>Christian: So, 12 years ago, my journey began because I was listening to the recordings of a consciousness explorer and physicist named Tom Campbell. And he made one statement in one video that just sent me in this little... I felt this little nudge to pay attention to, and it ended up sending me down this whole path. And the one sentence he happened to say was, "What you believe is not going to get you anywhere particularly important." And he meant you're not justified by your belief. And at the time, I thought I was because I had certain religious beliefs that I felt justified me, and I felt this little nudge inside like, "Why did that sting?" And I'm like, "Yeah, why did that sting? There must be a reason." So, I listened to his videos. <br>I bought his book. His book is a thousand-page book, and I opened it, and I'm thinking, "Man, am I going to read this?" Because this is very early, right? So, I was not familiar with this. And I opened up his book, and the first line of the preface is, "Yes, you need to take the time to read the preface and read this book." Because he knows it's so big. And his next sentence is something like, "You were raised in a culture which believes in quick gratification, but spiritual growth is not necessarily a fast, immediate gratification type process. You need to be willing to put in the time and energy." And I thought that was great. I was like, "Oh, I'm going to read this now." <br>So, I spent two years reading it, but more importantly, I began to meditate. And that was something he recommended from the start: "Go have your own experience. Find out yourself. Go search yourself. Investigate your own awareness itself—what your awareness is beneath thought, when you're not associated with the thinking. What is there? What's real?" And I began to do that just at first because it was relieving, you know? Like, it brought a sense of relief, and it felt good, and I was like, "Oh, that's nice. So, I'm going to keep doing this." And I did it for a few months. I would meditate for about maybe two 20-minute periods a day or one 30 or 40-minute period a day. Maybe I'd take one day off a week or something, but I stuck to it. <br>You know, I was interested, and he said, "You need to stick to it," and I was like, "Okay, I'll try this." Because I'm a very inquisitive, investigative type person, but I certainly didn't expect anything. I just continued it. And after about maybe four months or so, I had my first non-physical experience, which was extremely eye-opening. It was brief, but it was shockingly real, and it was not subtle.<br><br><br>Deborah: And what did you see?<br>Christian: So, I had an experience where it began as a dream, and in the dream, I was... this big tidal wave was going to come over and crush me. And so, in the dream, I said to myself, "Okay, you're going to die now. Let go of your body. You can leave your body." And when I did that, I suddenly shifted to a state of awareness where I was not dreaming. <br>I was fully alert and awake, but my body wasn't awake. But I was in the state where I was feeling these absolutely intense vibrations that were so intense, and it sounded like someone had parked a jet engine on either side of my head. And it was so loud, and the vibrations were so extreme, and I was stuck there for maybe 10 or 15 seconds or something, but it was terrifying. Like, it was not subtle. It was not like, "Oh, this is interesting." It was freaking shocking. <br>And when I woke up—when my body woke up—I leapt out of bed. I was sweating. I was freaked out. I was like, "What the hell was that?" Because it was so strong. It wasn't like a little thing, and it was so real. I was fully alert. I was fully there. I was totally conscious, but I couldn't... I didn't know what was happening. So, that was just the very first kind of brief glimmer. Since then, I've had out-of-body experiences, and I don't feel they're abnormal any longer. I don't necessarily try to go get them, but they happen.<br>Deborah: So, back up. So, that first occurrence happens. You're standing up, you're sweating, you're shocked.<br>Christian: Yeah.<br>Deborah: And then, so then I thought, "Well, there's something to this. I got to keep doing this. This is some... this is real. There's something going on here. I don't know what it is, but it's... that was very real. That was not just like, 'Oh, I had a dream and some kind of sensation in my brain.' It was like the body of my awareness was vibrating in a way that I had never experienced. It was so intense."<br>Deborah: It sounds like you entered your dream body, and it was put into an altered state. It was radically energetically shocked. I don't know how to label it, but all I knew is it was so real. It just prompted me like, "Keep going." So, I kept going, and I began to have other brief non-physical experiences at first. And I also began to have this pre-birth memory return to me. So, that's... that's usually people ask about that. How did the pre-birth memory... was it a dream state?<br>Christian: No, I was just awake, and I just realized I had memory. For me, I don't know how to describe it. It was very normal. It was like... it was no grand opening of the heavens or something. It was like... I don't even know what I was doing, but I was just doing some normal daily activity, and I realized I was thinking about and reviewing before I was born. And it was so normal. It was like... it was like the most normal thing. It was like the breakfast I had this morning or something like it was, but it was so real. It was so... very personal, very, very, very deep—like way deeper than a normal earthly memory. <br>Very ancient and yet happening right now, like I was there right now, but it was an ancient memory at the same time. And I realized, "Oh, that's what... that's why I... so, one of the main reasons I've come to Earth is to face and process a very deep fear." And I've done so much of that. I had done so much of that leading up to this. I really dealt with and processed a lot of this fear. And so, I noticed then, "Oh my gosh, like I planned this. Like, this is intentional. <br>I came here to do this on purpose." And then, as I had those realizations, they just slowly kept opening up to me over time—maybe over months or weeks or months, something like that. I don't know. And at first, it was just super interesting, but I also had the intuitive sense, and because I had been meditating, I had a certain relationship with my own thoughts. And so, I was able to kind of have a hands-off recognition when the stuff arose. And every once in a while, I get super curious, and I try to like ping into something and see if there was more information there. And sometimes I get all this information. Sometimes I get this kind of a block like, "No, you don't need to know about that right now." And it's like, "Okay."<br><br><br>Deborah: What I remember of your story was... this is the part that I've repeated to many people—that you had an encounter before you got here with a being who was super shiny and stood out, and you encountered him by... so, can you speak to that story?<br>Christian: Yeah, so long, long, long ago, before I was ever physical, before I had any physical incarnations, I remember coming across a being who had been physical. And the quality of his nature, his essence—this is really hard to describe—the body of his living light, his awareness, was so powerful and so rich and so full of joy and power and love and freedom. And I could feel it, and I was so inspired by the quality of this being. <br>And I said, "How did you do that? What did you possibly do to become this? And do you feel this depth of joy and freedom that I feel you feel?" And he shared with me, and I kind of like went into it and felt the depths of it, and I was just... I couldn't believe it. I was like, "Oh my gosh, that's amazing." <br>And he shared that he had been physical, and he shared one experience in particular in which he had lived a very difficult physical experience. He had suffered some kind of pain or ailment that lasted for a number of years, but the way that he met that experience, the way that he refined through it—it's very hard to describe—was incredible. And I said, "I want to do that. I'm going to do that. I want to do that."<br>Deborah: And did he say to you he'd been on Earth?<br>Christian: I don't have a specific memory of a planet or a name or anything like that. I just know that he had been a physical... I knew that it was some kind of intelligent physical... I guess you would call it relatively advanced. You know, it was a conscious physical being of some kind. I don't even know if it was human. <br>It certainly could have been human, but I don't actually know. But I remember feeling some of the pain that he had experienced, and I asked him, "Were you healed?" You know, because I felt how deeply he had been wounded and damaged in this physical life. And he said, "Yes." <br>And I felt the depth of the healing, and I felt like... like the depth to which we are wounded must be healed. Like, there is no... like, the quality of what we are is so unconditionally loving and so full of vibrance and life that when we suffer a deep... maybe a gouge or a canyon here, that canyon can only be filled again. So, I felt that in him, and it was like, "Oh my goodness." Now, that doesn't mean he was unchanged. You know, the experience affected him, and he grew from it. <br>He evolved. He became more, but he was completely healed. And I was so inspired. I was like, "I want to do that." And he said, "Well, go talk to your guides." So, I did.<br>Deborah: And didn't he say something like, "It's not that easy. Like, everyone wants to go there, but it's not such an easy..."?<br>Christian: Yeah, there was kind of a playful comment like, "Yeah, that's what they all say." Like, "And I... but like almost like, 'No, don't bother me with that.'" Like, not negative, but like, "No, no, no, you don't know what you're talking about. You don't know how hard this is." And I was persistent. I said, "No, I really want to do this." And he communicated, "Well, it's hard in a way that you just don't know. Like, it's difficult in a way you can't even conceive of right now. It's really, really difficult." Which now I understand, you know, as a human. I get it.<br><br><br>Deborah: Just pause for a minute. Yes, so the human condition without the awareness. And I love how you describe the long fall from where that occurred back here at the ranch and the density of the gravitational pull here and how life is so unbelievably stubborn and never stops showing up with the hardships back down here at the ranch. So, can you describe that distinction when you talked about the fall?<br>Christian: Yeah, the veil—the acceptance of the veil. So, the way I experienced it was as I accepted the veil, which is just the word we use for the constraints in consciousness that go along with being incarnated in having a physical body. As I accepted those constraints, what I experienced was a profound plummeting of the vibration of my being. So, like, if you imagine the body of your awareness—like, what you think is your body right now—it's actually not just your body. It's your aliveness that you're feeling—your aliveness. <br>Imagine that being connected to everything and being full of everything and just so full of joy and being connected to all knowing. And then going and plummeting down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower into a state where that knowing is cut off. The history is gone. Like, everything feels like it gets erased or shut off, turned off, closed off. And it feels like going down into a place that is like arriving to the vacuum of space. That's just a metaphor, but what I mean is it's just empty. It's dark. It's empty. There's no heat, but also so dense. <br>Like, being bodily was such a low vibration, dense experience by comparison. It would... I mean, in English, the colloquial way to put it was, "It was ridiculous." Do you know what I mean? Like, the state of being that I arrived to... I mean, I make jokes of it now, but it was... it was ridiculously low vibration to be in that state. And so, I was like, "I'm not okay with this. I'm not going to tolerate this. There's no way." So, I tried to fight my way out. And in this current life, I was reassured mightily because I had had a previous incarnation experience where I did reject the life, and it ended up killing the fetus, and I returned to the other side. But this time...<br>Deborah: Stop right there. This is very, very important.<br>Christian: Yeah.<br>Deborah: This really touched me for all the women in the world that I've worked with with miscarriages—when the fetus comes in, and spirit has made a decision to incarnate in some fashion. Yeah, and then there's the decision that somehow your soulmate... can you describe... like, you aborted ship. Like, you were not interested.<br>Christian: Yeah, so... okay, so I want to be sensitive to it because this is extremely personal and powerful. But you know, when I got... when I arrived, the simplest way to put it is I was overcome by fear because I wasn't myself anymore. I wasn't the all of me. I felt like I lost all that I am—like, all the eons of knowledge and joy. And I felt like I lost it all. And I was like, "I am... and plus, the vibration was so low. It's just like... it was ridiculous. It was like I don't know... being crammed into a tuna can or something." I'm like, "I am not doing... there's no way I'm putting up with this." <br>So, in that case, I mustered my might. I'm like, "I know I'm a powerful being." I pulled my might up, and I smoked the veil. I fought my way out. I'm like, "Uh-uh, not doing this." And I effectively... I was effective at doing that. I basically broke free, but I immediately had a life review—like a near-death experience—just describe... for that very short life. And I saw because I had killed the fetus by my rejecting the veil, the body had died. I had... I had cut... I don't know... I don't want to use the word "connection," but I had somehow... what I had done had interrupted the process. Right? <br>Yeah, some... maybe like a severing or something. I mean, it didn't feel like a severing. It felt more like me fighting my way out of a cloak. But in doing that, it had... you know, it killed the fetus. So, I had a life review, and I saw how my fear—because it was about my fear—like, I acted from fear. It was my choice. I did that even though I was only just there and even though I hadn't even been born yet. And there was no teaching or upbringing or anything like that. I still made that choice. <br>And so, I saw how my fear affected the poor mother and not only the poor mother but hundreds of other people whose lives were made more difficult because of the grief I heaped on the mother and the family, but primarily the mother. The feeling was really like... I... it was like loading weight onto her shoulders. And I felt... I was like, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe I did that." But now, from that side, you also know all as well. Like, you can see it very clearly. There's... it's okay. <br>There's nothing wrong, truly. But I also could just very objectively see like, "Oh, I have a lot of fear." Oh, because I had all these great intentions, but yet I had only caused more difficulty for the players in the game that I really respected so much. You know, I really respected these beings who were being human, and I couldn't believe that I had only made their journey more difficult.<br><br><br>Deborah: And then, with your guidance from your guides, you decided to reincarnate or come back in.<br>Christian: Yeah, I did. I knew I wanted to. I still had the same intention to re-engage the certain fear. So, I was brought this life as a possibility, and I reviewed it, and it was good. It wasn't as perfect as the first one would have been, actually, but it was good enough. It was a pretty good match with you.<br>Deborah: So, they show you. They give you a clue about what you're about to encounter.<br>Christian: Oh, yeah, no, not just a clue. It's like... like, they brought me... if you imagine like a life package or life packet—not literally like a package, but if it's like bringing it out of a database or something—and then, "What do you think about this?" And then I reviewed it. I reviewed millions and millions and millions of possibilities of what could transpire and how it would actually feel to be me in this life. It was more about... like, on Earth, we like to talk about events and time and place. <br>You know, we're always like, "When did what happen and where?" That's how we communicate here. But from the point of view that was secondary, what was primary was, "What would it be like to be me experiencing this? Like, what would the actual experience be like?" And there were all these different avenues. It was like if you laid a tree on its side and started at the thick end and worked your way out to the branches. And it was like some were more probable, and some were less probable, and I could perceive all of them.<br><br><br>Deborah: Do you think this is a universal truth that the humans have the capacity to witness or choose their circumstance?<br>Christian: Well, it's not the humans. Human is the... not the human—the soul. Sorry, that whatever is that... is that actually real in your mind?<br>Deborah: Yeah.<br>Christian: Well, so, okay, so the soul is... yes, because the soul is sovereign. So, what I mean is there is... the soul is a part of all that is—part of source. So, you are a part of source. So, there isn't actually like a deeper authority that can make you have to do something. You know what I mean? <br>So, the only way to be incarnated is to surrender yourself to it—to give over your power, so to speak. And I don't like those words—to allow yourself to be constrained is probably a better way to put it—so that you can have a very specific, well-defined, rigorous experience. <br>And so, because that's a choice, certainly the spirit, the soul, wants to know. It wants to see what it's signing up for. It's not blind. That's at least that's what I experienced. I mean, I certainly can't speak for everybody, but for me, it was absolutely well-informed. I asked questions about the life. I asked about planning certain things. Yeah, it was a very thorough review. <br>And I was so excited. I mean, like, if I had to just review... if I had to just summarize the whole review in one word, it was excitement—even though I knew that it was very likely that in my early 20s, I would be crushed and traumatized by a trauma, and I would... it would overcome me.<br>Deborah: The illness that you had.<br>Christian: Yeah, I had an illness at the age of 22 that led to my opportunity to re-engage this fear. I had post-traumatic stress for a number of years after this experience because of the fear. But at the time, then I... so, I then I... like, that I mean, when this happened when I was 22, of course, I had no awareness that this plan, of course. But at the time, pre-life, I was very excited. <br>And in fact, not only excited, I was so honored—so honored at being given the opportunity to play a human and to live a human life because human lives are so precious. Every one of them is like... like a winning lottery ticket in the context of the scope of all that is. Like, it's such an honor because it means that... how do I put this? Like, we have to be evolved to a certain degree to even be human. <br>Put it that way. Like, being human is rigorous. It's a challenge. It's a serious... you know, it's a very dense, detailed, high-bandwidth, high-capacity physical experience. And so, to be given the chance to be a human, it's like, "Wow, like, I'm honored." Like, because it means it's seen that there may be a great benefit to you because the system is very efficient. It's not like random, you know, throwing things around. It's like they can see. The guides are very wise. They have access to all the data.<br>Deborah: Hello, this is why astrology works because the design is so intricate and so unbelievably vast. So, what you're saying is the reason why there's eight billion people here is because everybody wants to be here and to have this encounter in the name of evolution, in the name of transformation. Can you help me understand why anybody would come to this crazy planet?<br>Christian: Yeah, well, I can't speak to astrology specifically. Like I said, I don't have much knowledge in that area. It's not of particular focus for me. But with regards to evolution... oh, yes. Okay, so this is really important. And it's like I really wish I could just tell everybody like... because this is so like... what we're doing here—the opportunity to come out into this place and to reach this level of engagement and to process it—like, to process experience here and to see if we can make loving choices, actualize love, and overcome fear because those are synonymous—is an incredible opportunity for expansion.<br>It'd be like... I've spent so many hours trying to think of a way to articulate this better, but I just can't. But if you take... this is just a metaphor... if you take source—like, imagine a sun or something over here—and then you're a piece of it. So, you're connected. Now, if you can go out to here or out to here or all maybe all the way out even out to here, and you can integrate that and process that and bring love to that and shine light through that... and when I say process, I mean integrate the experience, overcome your fear, really connect it with the dots, and really come to understand it at a being level—not just an intellectual level. <br>If you can do that, there is this profound expansion of being out to there. So, the further out we go, the deeper into contrast we go, the more the opportunity for growth. And that is why there is such a desire actually to take on lives that we could consider potentially very difficult. In fact, sometimes it's the guides who say to us, "No, no, no, that's too much. You're trying to do too much in one life. You're trying to sign up for too much. Just, you know..." So, there's kind of this... maybe optimal target you could say where we try to take on an experience that will challenge us and help us to grow but not so hard.<br>Deborah: I don't know. Well, here's one of my esoteric laws brought to you by Alice Bailey: "The bigger the spirit, the bigger the lesson." So, the spirits that are ambitious like you are—your chart as a double Aries gets so excited. It's not funny. Like, you're on fire. Your soul and your ego are both on fire. Your mind—your Mercury is in Pisces—the water element that meditates and dreams. <br>You have an incredibly strong capacity for your mental body to receive the impression from the other side. But I want to say to this—the people that are listening to this—they have a really hard life. They feel stuck. Something's not working. They can't do... their children's not well. They have health issues. They can't find their mate. They found too many mates. They have all... I'm a therapist, so I've heard all the stories. And what you're suggesting is echoing Alice Bailey that the bigger the lessons, the bigger the growth cycle.<br>Christian: Yeah, so the larger the contrast, the greater the opportunity for expansion through that contrast—if and as we can integrate it, meet it, shine love into it in all the things that love means. So, if someone is having a Christian life where they are really following the laws of the Bible, for example, and they're embodying that... that is a generative lifetime. Like, it doesn't matter what you do. It's the quality of love and fearlessness you embody.<br>Deborah: Exactly.<br>Christian: So, the form of the Earth—the forms, the objects, the ideas, the thoughts, the belief systems—the form is all secondary. It's local context, and consciousness, which precedes form, shines through the context. And what is that shining? It's intent. So, it wields choices. It makes choices. <br>So, we make choices in the context. It's a simple way to put it, but the... but so, what are we doing? We are refining our ability to wield an intent that is more in alignment with our true nature, which is love—which is total love, total freedom, total joy. And so, when we have an intent that is more in alignment with that in whatever context, we tend to expand. We tend to experience joy ourselves. <br>And where, on the other hand, where we buy into interpretations of things that are not in alignment with the truth of who we are, we experience fear. And that's a very low vibration experience. So, the whole context is actually neutral, even though there can be some very extreme things that happen. We always apply the meaning to the neutral context that's occurring. It's just that that neutral context on Earth can get very extreme in certain times—very extreme.<br>Deborah: So, can I ask you—in your own personal life, does this awareness that you have that frees you of getting captured by the density or by the heaviness or the circumstance because you know this is just polishing for the... you know, we're trying to finish or create awareness through our hardship—does that get to be applied in your story like changing jobs or dealing with your kids? Or how does that apply back at the ranch?<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, I mean, I really try to apply it back at the ranch. And I'm not going to claim I'm some master or something. I... it's... I still get associated with the form too. You know, the more we focus into it and think about it, the more deeply wrapped in it we get. You know, the more we think the same thoughts, the more that becomes our reality. <br>The more we think about work, the more we are the worker. You know, the more we... whatever role we're feeling that we get deeply associated into that. So, sometimes, of course, it's difficult to retain that... you know, that living... like, to bridge that gap. But I do feel like bridging that gap is what I'm trying to do and what I'm here to do. I feel... I feel a little bit like... just one metaphor... I feel a little bit like I have one... it's the Grand Canyon vibrationally, and I have one toe on the other side and my foot on this side, and I'm really trying to bridge the gap because if I can do that, there's this integration that occurs. But it's not just about me. It's about all of us—the process that we're all going through to actualize love and integrate our experience here on Earth.<br>Deborah: I'm going to show you once again here. Let me just minimize this because I just did it twice. I wanted to see your chart so bad. I did it twice. Your life lesson is about practicality and being a perfectionist. Do you know that part of yourself?<br>Christian: Yes.<br>Deborah: And it gets obsessive. The details in your chart—if there's a doorway this lifetime that you would be tested upon, it would be that you get caught in wanting things to be just so, and when they're not, you wrestle with yourself to not ever recognize when there is enough as enough. Am I right or am I wrong?<br>Christian: I don't think that's that accurate actually in this case, but there is something related. Related to perfectionism is definitely a sense of... like, when I was younger, I felt like, "Well, there must be a better and a worse way to do everything." <br>And I did constantly seek to try to understand that and find that out. Like, I remember one day catching myself early in my awakening when I was becoming aware at how associated I was with thinking. I caught myself thinking, "What is the correct amount of laundry detergent to put in the cup?" And it's a simple question, you know? It's so... it's so simple, but I was like, "Why am I focused on that?" Because... and... and I figured... I mean, in my case, this is probably a tangent, maybe not worth going down, but I believed in form. <br>Okay, that's what we do here. We believe in the form. We believe the form is it. That's what failing. You know, we feel separated from each other. We think the world is the physical world is what we got. That's what we got. So, we try to take these larger feelings and like impose them into this... this non-fundamentally real system, and it's not necessary. And it's not necessary.<br>Deborah: That was not tangential. So, I called it the perfectionist. What you're talking about is the perfected form becoming a little obsessed when you were young and catching it and realizing that you have three planets in Virgo, and the measuring of detergent is something that a Virgo could get completely lost in unless... and this is what I want to adjust—what you have altered to allow yourself to keep that big picture in focus because clearly your chart is prone to details. <br>But you have this... I just want to share one more little small detail here. You have this wonderful opposition. So, your Mercury in Pisces—the visionary—it's right opposite all the Virgo details. So, you dance between being able to go to the other side, see the spiritual overview, and then come back at the ranch and translate it into details for us here on this podcast. So, you have this wonderful bridge between, "I know the other side, but I'm not letting go of my big toast standing here in the practical world."<br>Christian: Yeah, there's one example I can bring up that speaks to that. So, when I was younger, I was focused on... in this example, getting a good GPA back in college. And I did very well. I got straight A's because I worked my butt off, and I thought it was very important. I subsequently discovered it wasn't very important. You know, that it never made a significant difference in my professional life. <br>But more than that, when I began to go through this awakening process, I reached this very humbling discovery moment. And I don't want to misarticulate this, but this is important. I discovered that my knowledge didn't mean anything. Like, what I mean is all that I had achieved in intellectual space on Earth meant nothing. Almost not nothing because the process of achieving it is experientially meaningful, but it's not meaningful unto itself. The knowledge is all... like, the system already has all knowing. What we're here to do is to become love. <br>That process is not like... like, when I used schooling, I didn't recognize it at the time, but I was very afraid. You know, "I have to get a good job. I'm not going to have enough money. I have to differentiate myself." But more than that, I had... I now understand self-worth images that I didn't perceive at the time. And so, I told my ego did what the ego does, and it says, "Look, you have worth because look, you got a 4.0. See, now you have worth." It's like, "I prove it to you. You proved it to yourself. Here's your worth."<br>Deborah: One of the steps we go through, I feel, in discovering what is real is all those ego stories that we thought proved us to ourselves. They have to go too because that's not where our worth is derived. Our worth is not derived in the GPA or the money or the position or the attractiveness or our health or what we've been able to do for someone else in some specific way. It's definitely not in possessions. You know what I mean? Like, none of that matters. <br>What matters is the quality of our being. And you have to throw away so much of the old toys that made you feel better in your own mind and in your own ego in order to reach that quality of being. You know, like, I'll have another example of that because this is one that was very difficult for me at the time. I was raised in a Lutheran setting, so for a long time, I had Lutheran Christian beliefs. It was very difficult for me to recognize that I was justifying myself again—another simple pattern of the ego. "Look, you have value because look, now that you believe that, when you believe the certain thing, you have value." I believed that that was uplifting for me. <br>You have to be able to recognize, "Oh my gosh, like, my value isn't even derived from that." Like, what I mean is our value is intrinsic. It comes with the substance of being. We are a part of the ocean of all that is, and all that is is wonderful and beautiful. You are an irreplaceable, precious drop in the ocean. You cannot be replaced. You are precious. You are beautiful and loving and full of love and loved and adored. And that is absolutely true no matter what forms you play with on Earth and no matter what games you play with yourself to try to convince yourself of it through ego process.<br>Deborah: So, in other words, if someone is wealthy, if someone is poor, if someone is fat, if someone is thin, if someone is successful, someone's famous, if someone... this is all just outworkings of the ego in order for us to remember who we really are.<br>Christian: Oh, well, I just mean that the ego uses all of those things to try to fill the gap. You know, now, because we feel afraid, we get here, and we're like, "Oh my gosh, there's a huge problem." See, we may not be able to intellectually identify, but when we get to the human condition, now there's a big problem because now I don't feel connected to everything. I don't feel all powerful. I don't feel the active love source. What the hell is going on? It's a huge problem. <br>And so, as we grow, it kind of becomes even more of a problem because we get so deeply wrapped in the stories of Earth and in all the associations. And our parents say, "Hey, you do well in school. There's your value." You know, "You perform a certain way. There's your value. Get married and have kids, or you don't have value." You know, whatever it is, we really buy into that. And our ego is trying all the time to lift up whatever it can. "How about this? You have value now. <br>How about this?" And unfortunately, for many people, it can take harmful forms too, of course. "Look, you can harm the person next to you, so you're powerful." That, of course, is not the way, but the ego will do it because we're doing anything we can to try to fill this gaping hole that now is there because of this separation experience of separation, which is non-native to who we really are. <br>We are not actually separate from each other. We're not. I know it looks that way. It's very persistent and consistent. I know. I mean, it's so strange. I go into the office. I look around. Everyone is, you know, dressed nicely, doing their professional, putting on the face, speaking to each other. No one knows that we're connected. No one knows that we're one with each other. We're loving brothers and sisters. We're playing this deep game.<br>Deborah: And what's the part about this game? Here's one of the questions I ask everybody on my podcast. I wish that people would fill in the blank. What would Christian say if I said to you, "I wish people would..."?<br>Christian: I wish people would know who they truly are.<br>Deborah: I was going to say, "Take the actions to work toward knowing who you really are." But it's not like there's... we like to think in terms of action and result, and it gets very confusing if we try to immediately even if we say, "Meditate to get this result." Meditation is a wonderful path. It's not like an action and a result. <br>But anyway, I would wish that everybody would find who they really are. I mean, really, there's only two problems happening on Earth. Like, there's only two issues. Every single other issue arises from these two things: one, we're ignorant of who we really are—like, we just don't know—and two, we have fear. That's it. Every single thing that we're dealing with that's negative arises out in one form or another out of those two—fear giving rise to ego and all the patterns that the ego does.<br><br><br>Deborah: I have a question. I have a really important question because this is... as an astrologer, you can imagine I spent a lot of my life being in the observer, looking at the human patterns, and understanding the psychology of why we do what we do. I just want to know what they were thinking when they implemented so much ignorance and the disconnect from the source. Like, what's the exercise here that would be conducive because it doesn't seem like it's working?<br>Christian: Oh, it's working. So, I don't mean to be contrarian. It's working. So, it's not they. It's us. Like, it's not some other being, some other thing that's inflicting this upon us. Here we are afflicted. No, we got on the roller coaster. The roller coaster is really fast. We're the ones who got on and strapped in, even if we don't remember. And I know that's so hard for so many. We have difficult lives. I know. It's a volunteer position. I give you that. No, 100% a choice to be here.<br><br><br>Deborah: My question is the design—the design of the human brain. Said the therapist to witness the self-sabotage and the lack of ability for some—not for all—to have an appetite for this conversation. Some people are on the edge of their seat right now going, "Relief. This is what happened to me when I met your work. Relief. Relief. I knew it. This is a precious gift being alive." And while my ego mind may resist it and my ego mind may interpret it based on what should be, my heart of hearts knows this is the highest road for me to evolve in the name of my family and the name of evolution itself. And please, use me. I think it's every day. <br>But back at the ranch, I see levels of consciousness, and I've worked with people from all over the world, and I see certain people who really don't have the capacity. And I say, I think to myself, if I had a little homeopathy dropper that I could just put under their tongue and give them the appetite to reduce all the noisy, addictive, violent, evil impulses. And I find it almost mean that they've mixed those people with us.<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, okay. Two comments. First, the... what your question really is is why does the level of constraint have to be so high? Like, why are the limitations so extreme? That's really the first question. Okay, so to that comment, the only way I can comment on that is a metaphor. Why would you lift a heavier weight and not a lighter weight? You know, what's the value in that? Why lift 50 pounds when you could lift 10? Why would you do that? Well, because 50 pounds offers a counter pressure that 10 pounds doesn't. <br>And the level of constraint that we're here experiencing as human—and this and the experience of separation—is a tremendous level of constraint. It's a tremendous counter pressure. So, if we can make loving choices under this... I don't want to say duress. I was going to say duress, but under this level of limitation—because it doesn't have to be duress—but under this level of limitation, there is a profound expansion that occurs that can only occur here under this level of counter pressure. But the countercurrent is highly valuable.<br>Okay, to your second comment, you made a comment... you know, why... why insert those people? There's... I'm... there's not a distinction between you and I and those people because the fear that you and I have is the same as them. The fear that Hitler had and the fear that I have is very similar. It's not... like, what I mean is it's the problem is fear. And where there is fear, insanity always ensues. <br>Like, when we act from fear, we are insane. We're unconscious, and we damage each other in the world. And whether that's happening to a small degree or a large degree, it's important, but it's not really the fundamental distinction. Really, the issue is simply that we have fear. So, really, it's about us as beings applying ourselves into and through this very high constraint set. And sometimes it's too difficult for us, and the ego rises mightily throughout a lifetime to try to protect the self, and that happens. But it's okay. So, but... I think I'll stop there in case you'll fall off because there's a few ways that could go.<br><br><br>Deborah: Well, I think I really appreciate what you said. So, fear is at the source of all of the insanity.<br>Christian: I would agree.<br>Deborah: I do know we're all connected, and my mystery is... or I have this recurring complaint that when I get home, I'm afraid they're going to scream at me because I'm constantly... I'm constantly repeating, "Oh no, that's fine." What are they thinking when they put in place an unconscious mind that has no filter? <br>The kidneys and the liver can take out whatever body food I take in that's poisonous, but the thought process can come in to go hurt a child. And rather than be a guardian at my unconscious and say, "No, no, no, no," and put me down into time out, I can act on those impulses. And my curiosity is the design of the human body, which is so masterful, and the design of the human brain, which is so shaky, is so contrary that I want to talk to the creators. Me, I've been talking to myself for years. Deborah, what were you thinking when you allowed the unconscious mind to have impulses that are absolutely evil and let that continue without any governor?<br>Christian: Well, now I have a governor. I have a governor.<br>Deborah: Yeah.<br>Christian: So, it is still fear when those impulses come up because that's just ego. Ego is just a word we use for the part of ourselves that is struggling to find a solution and plug the hole, even if it's with fake filler. You know, stands for evading God's oneness. That's true, but it doesn't know it's evading God's oneness. It is just the portion of ourselves that is trying to assert and reclaim our own power. So, your question is a little bit like asking why does someone have to try to reclaim their own power? You know what I mean? Like, I'm just trying to point out that there's not really an enemy.<br><br><br>Deborah: I know. I know. The... now that's a really hard idea for the ego because the ego loves enemies. My goodness, if we can identify our enemies, now we got them labeled. Now I'm the good guy, and they're the bad guy, and now we're set because now I have established some power.<br>Christian: The... the all... there is no true enemy. The enemy is our own unevolvedness. So, where we have our own fear, that's the problem. But the good news is, though, we are not powerless to that enemy. We have the profound opportunity and ability to meet our own fear in whatever small way we can. And that may sound like a small thing. It's not. If we meet our own fear and we process our own crap and we own the way that we are rejecting reality—"How am I rejecting reality? <br>How am I hurting the person next to me? How am I prioritizing the self over the other?" You know, whatever. I ask this question all the time: "How can I be more loving? How can I open up my heart? How can I take the high road? How can I figure out my silly little ego's mind and tell her to take a break?" And I'm getting better at it as the years go by. This aging thing is really serving me. I am endlessly...<br>Deborah: It does that. I am endlessly... I personally suffer from the compassion that I have for those that cannot diminish their fear. And I am so curious by them. I find them fascinating, to tell the truth. I find Hitler fascinating. I've studied his chart at length. What part of the human psyche allows that kind of ego to be acceptable?<br>Christian: The psyche comes after the consciousness and its intent. It's built on it and in it over the course of a lifetime. So, that's why fear and ignorance are the real roots. It's only because of fear and ignorance that some structure needs to be built. It doesn't actually need to be. It's because we're yet unevolved such that when we get applied into this context and into this level of constraint, our fear is great. And where fear is great, we do all sorts of shenanigans.<br><br><br>Deborah: Do you feel like as a species, we are evolving and moving towards...?<br>Christian: Absolutely. Absolutely, we are.<br>Deborah: What's your evidence?<br>Christian: Yeah, so a couple of things. So, first of all, a few comments. First, in my pre-birth experience, I was aware that the human race is going through a transition—an awakening—and that the trajectory was towards awakening towards a higher vibration state. But it was also a very high friction period of time that my life would be occurring in. And that was just known. It wasn't like a big, interesting thing. It was just like very obvious. It's like... it's like acts in a play. Like, this is the act that we're in now. We're in act seven. I don't know. I'm making it up. <br>Whatever. We're in some act. This is the awakening act where we try to deal with all the gross, crude fear patterns that are in the collective consciousness and try to really process them, heal them, and we try to own our own crap and lift our vibration such that we don't know we're lifting our vibration, but we're integrating our experience such that love can more thoroughly shine through us. That's the first thing.<br>The second thing is the system is very efficient. So, what I mean is spirit is not inefficient. The universe is not inefficient. And while we as humans, since we have ego and we reject what we see around us very quickly, we don't like when something takes more than a day or a year or a lifetime because there's not a significant difference for there to be change. <br>Do you know what I mean? Like, it's all a small portion of time in relation to the breadth of who we really are. So, the ego is like, "No, I want change right now. I don't want to change tomorrow. I want to change right now. Where's my change?" You know, that's okay. <br>That also, by the way, is part of the problem though because that's fear. But anyway, so all I mean is this: the system is very efficient. And so, not only... like, the universe is built for this purpose of integrating experience. So, it's very good at giving us what we fear so that we can process it. But we also have an amazing amount of support. There are many non-physical beings, for instance, on the other side who come and help us and are with us and assist us and give us their nudges, their support, their love. <br>This is a system of love ultimately, even though we look around us and we look like we're in a love desert sometimes. The actual foundation behind the curtains—you know, the stage, you could say, the stage of the play—is made of love. And that love is very intelligent. So, even though we can't see with our very dense, limited human thinking minds because they only handle one small thing at a time—like, our human thoughts are like dense, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk. <br>That's what we do all day long. From the perspective of spirit, it's much more efficient, much more thorough, much better vantage point. That whole system is working to facilitate our own individual growth. You know, we like to think about, "Oh, this is about humanity. This isn't so much about me. This is humanity's problem." Actually, it's about you. I'm sorry to say because you are part of humanity. <br>And so, when you face your own fear and meet your own crap, it's like a light bulb that goes on in the ocean and shines permission vibrationally to everyone else to do the same thing. So, when you face your own crap, you are actually fixing the problem without knowing it. You're actually encouraging those around you because you yourself are changing the temperature of the water. <br>You are your drop in the ocean. If you increase your drop's temperature, the ocean's temperature will increase not only because you're warmer in this crude metaphor but because you are also giving permission to and creating a vibrationally accepting environment for everyone else to do it too. And one awakened person is way more vibrationally impactful than many who are not awake. So, it is not a situation of hopelessness. Giving into hopelessness is kind of like a waste of time. I don't mean to make light of it, but it's not necessary. The whole framework is one of hope.<br>Deborah: So beautiful.<br><br><br>Christian: And I had a third comment, but...<br>Deborah: Okay, so hold on. I want to hear your third now. You go now.<br>Christian: The third comment was simply that you asked why... why do I say that we're increasing? And the third is simply that I'm vibrationally sensitive. I can feel non-physical energy, and I can feel like when I go into crowds now, the vibrational temperature is higher than 20 years ago. You know, so I don't know much about it. I'm not quick to put labels on it, but it's definitely happening. The vibrational temperature is higher.<br>Deborah: As in more loving, more aware?<br>Christian: Yeah, like, and a lot of the crap that we see on the surface—a lot of these old themes that we're dealing with, you know, racism and accepting people for who they are—these very basic ideas, I don't mean to make light of this because we have a major problem with this as a human race, but like accepting each other for who we are—for our sexuality, for our race, for our age, for our gender—these are very basic things to the spirit. We're all one. We of course love accepts each other. <br>We should be accepting each other. But anyway, we have a long history of not doing that. You know, we have a long history of us versus them thinking and ego patterns of superiority and elitism. And so, therefore, since those patterns are in the collective consciousness, now when the vibration increases, it begs for those to be refaced and integrated. So, you have experiences like political events where racism comes back up to be faced, and then you have a lot of people say, "You know what? This is not... why are we doing this?"<br>Deborah: And let me ask you a wild question. I recently had Dr. Steven Greer on my podcast. What are your thoughts about ETS?<br>Christian: Yeah, what is your question? Do aliens exist?<br>Deborah: Yeah.<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, of course. Yeah, so the human race is just one of many. The universe is really, really big. I don't have much specific knowledge about that, but I'm aware the Earth is not the only planet we can incarnate on. And not only that, the whole... okay, so our physical universe is ridiculously huge—hundreds of billions of galaxies with hundreds of billions of stars each. I mean, it's just unfathomably huge. <br>And the Earth is only the tiniest, tiniest corner of that. And that whole thing—that whole universe—is just one tiny little speck of all that is. And then we ask, "Are there beings other than humans?" Of course, yes, there are beings other than humans. It's not really a big deal. Yes, there are, of course. <br>Humans are very precious. I mean, I really sensed the preciousness of the chance to be human. Like I said, it was like, "Wow, this is a happening place. This is a high-intensity, rubber-meets-the-road, important place where humanity is right now in this period in linear time." But yes, there are other races.<br>Deborah: And do you see the prospect, as an astrologer, and certainly in Dr. Steven Greer's work, that we are at this critical juncture? We are in this transition where love is being invited in, and fear is being diminished. And you are an optimist, I'm assuming, and that you're hopeful that we'll make it over this ecological terror because I've been doing lots of podcasts with the scientists who are not as positive as you are.<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, well, yeah, I am very optimistic. So, but the thing is, the way that we tend to measure success as humans is different than true success. So, I'm just saying that because, you know, it's possible we could destroy the Earth and all die. That really wouldn't be that big of a deal. I don't think it's going to happen, but it's not really that... I know that sounds like, "Oh my gosh," but this... it's important. <br>It's precious, but it's also... we are not human. Like, you're you, and you're going to be here whether or not you're experiencing the human suit or not. It's like, you know, if we all took off our shirts, it's not really a big deal. You know, okay, now you're put on a different shirt. You're still you. You're just wearing a different shirt. It's kind of like that with physical experiences. It's okay. I don't think it's going to happen. <br>I'm just saying that like... there is a reality to the coral diminishing to the point of 85%. There's a reality to the ice melting. There's a reality to the humans in the war experience in Russia, in China. So, that's not to say we haven't always had these dramas. It's just there's a critical juncture right now with the ecosystems. And to your point, I'm with you. The sustaining of love will never be touched. <br>The choice of people waking up inside the dream continues at multiple levels. I just can't see them—the ability for us to speak a language, whether it's astrology or science or whatever the language you're using, to help facilitate the exercise of the mind's openness, willingness to use these faculties and polish them. My job is going to continue with or without a physical form or with or without Earth. It's so arrogant of us. How dare we think this is it? I mean, if this is it, I'm worried.<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, it's not it. It's definitely not it. Everything you just mentioned is very important. The Earth is very important, and what we do with our choice-making is very important. Every decision, in fact, every thought is important. <br>So, I'm not taking away from that. Simultaneously, as I say, you're talking about the set of the stage. Like, it's important, but it's a play. It's a living play, but it's a play. So, I just think it's important to keep that in mind because we tend to feel threatened. See, this is the thing. We feel threatened when something that supports us or something we love is threatened or someone we love is threatened or our money is taken away or our health is taken away. We naturally—I'm not saying it's unnatural to do this—but we feel threatened. <br>But the reason we feel threatened is we are so identified with those forms when, in fact, we are not the forms. It's a little bit like when you wake up in the morning from sleeping, and you just had a dream. You look around, and you don't have to have someone convince you that this is the real world and that was just a dream. It's self-evident. It's just obvious. And you're able to think back and say, "Wow, that was just a dream. It was intense. It was very interesting." Now, this is kind of like that. It's like a dream. It's very real. It's a real experience. <br>The experience we're having here is real, but the form is a dream that is occurring on and in and within our consciousness itself. Even the body—it's not that you're in your body. It's that your body is an experience of form and sense data happening within you, within your awareness. And when the body is gone, all that happens is that just drops away. That sense data—like the data stream gets cut off. That's Tom Campbell's term—data stream. I love that term. It's like consciousness pre-exists. It receives a data stream. Your body dies—data stream gets shut off. That's it. You're still there. You're still totally there. You never went anywhere.<br><br><br>Deborah: Okay, I'm going to ask you a quick question I ask all of my interviewees. If there's something in this life that you wouldn't want to live without, what would that be? Or a couple of things that you just wouldn't not want to be without.<br>Christian: Boy, I can't name so many things. Tell me.<br>Deborah: Hmm.<br>Christian: I mean, what comes to mind immediately is breath and music and my loved ones, you know, and the ability to feel, the ability to move, and to think, and to play piano. You know, there's so many things. It's just like... but it's all form, but none of it's us either. You know, we can lose it. We could lose it too, but I love it. You know, I love the world. I love life. It's so obvious.<br>Deborah: If there was somebody that wasn't alive or alive that you could talk to and have a really good conversation with, who would it be? Someone who wasn't physically alive. It could be physical or not. If there was somebody that you could conjure up and say, "God, I'd really like to ask a few questions."<br>Christian: Or... um, it would probably be... this sounds silly, but I have a desire to meet Seth—the guy who was channeled through Jane Roberts back in the 80s. I just have this personal goal to meet Seth someday. So, maybe I'd say Seth. I also love Silver Birch. Silver Birch is another channeled being.<br>Deborah: I know exactly who that is. I would love to meet Silver Birch. And Pisces, you have invisible friends on the other side. I haven't interacted with them, but I know they're real.<br>Christian: Tell me.<br>Deborah: The last time that you cried.<br>Christian: Uh, probably a few weeks ago. Sometimes it's just poignant being human and experiencing the limitations of work stress and the body. You know, it's okay to cry. There's nothing wrong. There's nothing wrong at all with any of our emotions, any of our feelings.<br>Deborah: So beautiful to cry. My goodness, it is all of it's beautiful.<br>Christian: Yeah.<br>Deborah: And what's the one question I should have asked you that I didn't ask you?<br>Christian: Oh, boy. Hmm. One question you didn't ask me that you should have asked me that would have created a really good... is there anything to fear?<br>Deborah: Good question.<br>Christian: No. And better—I don't mean to oversimplify it, but it is absolutely true. There is nothing to fear.<br>Deborah: That makes me want to cry. Like, if we know that, this other crap naturally resolves so much of it.<br>Christian: Yeah.<br>Deborah: That just shifted my heart. This is what happened, Christian, when I met your work. When you talked in the book about if you knew how beautiful it was on the other side, you would be so homesick, I like pulled out my yellow highlighter, circled it, cut it out, and then ate the piece of paper. I was like, "Did you literally do that?" No. Okay, but the point is that I... that sentence—"There's nothing to fear"—if I could integrate your words into my body and then into my heart and then into my soul... I've never heard someone say that, and I think secretly I've always known that. I lived through a very... like you, very, very traumatic experience throughout this lifetime. I've had more than once of murder and, you know, crazy things that I know were shown to me. I have not to the degree you do, but I have a very strong relationship with my guides, and I have since I was very young. And I've been given the gift of being able to, as an astrologer, share that information that comes from the higher realms. So, I facilitate people falling in love. What I've never heard or thought of before is how do I reduce your fear?<br>Christian: Yeah, um, rather than think of fear as something to be reduced, it's a mist that evaporates when we find the truth. Like, it's not a thing that we have to fight and push down real hard. I mean, there are moments to do that. I'm not saying we shouldn't forcefully push down our fear. There are times to do that, for sure. Again, it's a mist that evaporates once we realize who we really are, what love really is, the true power. Once we know the true power, the mist evaporates.<br>Deborah: Mr. Talk, can you stop? Mr. No Ear, can we just take that in once more?<br>Christian: Yeah, if we could recognize that it's a mist, it's simply trying to help us remember who we are.<br>Deborah: Why does it make me want to cry?<br>Christian: Because it's so true.<br>Deborah: Yeah, when we have true perspective, there can be no fear. Like, when we know the truth, there can be no... there's nothing because it's just seen. It's known. It's felt. Like, when the truth is known, it's just known. There's nothing to fear. And that's one of the reasons why, when we're on the other side choosing to come to do some incredible things here, we know who we really are. We know we are immortal beings. We really are. It's not just in our religious or spiritual thing—it's just what we are. And when we know that, there's nothing to fear. Fear can only happen when we buy into the illusion of the separation and the resultant beliefs and labels that we put on the experience after that illusion has been taken on.<br>Deborah: Thank you so much for the work that you do.<br>Christian: Thank you. Thank you for the work you do.<br>Deborah: Thank you, everybody today who's listening, for being human. I think that's really important to say. Nobody thanks you for being human lately, probably, but it's true. It's a very meaningful walk. Thank you for being here today.<br>Christian: And thank you for the opportunity. It's beautiful.<br>Deborah: Thank you so much for listening.

Thank you so much. It's wonderful to be here.  <br>You know, I've been looking forward to this interview for quite some time because I discovered you on YouTube. I listened to your story, and somehow it just felt like it healed me. And then I read your book, A Walk in the Physical, which inspired me so much, I cannot explain. I was sitting on the airplane on my way to Athens, and it was like my vibration just was up there. That I was vibing so high. I don't know, it just resonated so much with me. And also your story, which is really unique. Like, I haven't heard that.  <br>I've interviewed many people around their near-death experiences, and there have been channelings and stuff like that, but I've never interviewed someone who really remembers the choices they made of coming down to this planet. And there's so much we could speak about today. And I'm really curious to see where we're led to go today. But I would really love for you to share your story of how you remember your state of being or existence before this life as Christian that you have today.  <br>Sure, yeah, I'm happy to share. I'll do what I can. Before I do, I have to disclaim first that language cannot possibly speak to our higher natures or the larger spiritual context from which we come. Our language is earthly form, earthly symbols based in limitations that exist on Earth that are not fundamental to other reality systems. So I'm happy to share and try to use language, but the moment we open our mouths and try to speak to this, it's just wrong.  <br>Okay, so I will share my experience to the best of my ability. Please do interrupt if you'd like.  <br>So I remember long ago, before I had ever been physical, and I say long ago, but this is also... these memories feel like millions of years old, but they also feel like they're alive right now. So it's like super ancient and super personal, but also like a living state.  <br><br><br>I remember coming across this being who had been physical and feeling from this being the quality of his nature, his essence. This is very hard to describe, but it's like those environments are telepathic, most higher reality systems. We sense and feel our connection with each other, and we can share telepathically and feel what the other person is and what they're feeling.  <br>And I expressed to him, "My goodness, like, what could you possibly have done to be this?" Because I felt so much power and joy and freedom in this being. He was amazing. And he shared with me... he shared with me several things, but among what he shared with me was that he had lived a physical life. And in this physical life, he had dealt with chronic health pain, chronic health condition, some kind of pain that lasted with him for years, like a long period of time.  <br>And the quality of being with which he met that experience allowed a refinement of his being, his nature, his essence. And I remember asking him, "Were you healed?" Because I could feel, like, how deeply he had been damaged, apparently damaged in this physical experience. And he shared, "Yes, he had been healed." I could feel the depth of the healing that he had experienced.  <br>And I said, "I want to do that. I'm going to do that. I want to do that." And I was just very inspired and persistent. These words sound bad, but it was kind of like he brushed me off in a playful way, not a negative way, but like, "Yeah, that's what they all say." Like, basically, "You don't understand. You don't have experiential understanding for how hard it can be."  <br>But I was persistent. I said, "No, I want to do it. I am going to do it." And so he said, "We'll go talk to your guides."  <br>So what were you then? It seems like you were aware that there was something that was called healing, because from what I understand and I've read your book, you were sort of in peace and harmony and part of the creation and consciousness, but yet you knew that there was something to heal.  <br>Okay, yeah. So it's true that I was one with all, and it's not just a state of simplicity. In this moment, I was moving with this being and hundreds of other beings across what we would describe as like a landscape of light. And we were all going to do a shared activity. And I don't remember what that activity was, but I remember feeling the quality coming off of this being.  <br>So you could say we're like beings of light. I mean, that's a very crude and oversimplified way to put it. And there are many different reality systems, so I don't want to confuse that state, that reality system, with the ultimate fundamental state of being. The fundamental nature of what we are is consciousness itself, which transcends all description, all limitation, but we shine through various reality systems of various levels of complexity or difficulty.  <br>So anyway, in this experience, yes, I could feel from this being, like, what he was and how much joy and power and freedom he knew and he was and he contained. I don't know if that's the right word, because his nature and my nature are shared. We can feel that connectedness, that oneness. Like you yourself, you're individuated, but you're also one with the whole.  <br>In many of these higher systems, you also know, like, how do I describe this? Like, even the environment outside of you. If it's a visual experience, you don't need to have a visual experience. But if it's a visual experience and you're seeing, like, a landscape, you can feel that that landscape is within you and you're connected to it and you're a part of it. You know that you're not separate from it, even though you're yourself.  <br>So I don't know if that spoke to your question.<br>
Absolutely. I know there's so much to this story. Yeah. So please go on.  <br>Okay, so I don't have right after that, but I remember going and finding this being again later, after I had been physical, like, I had had many physical experiences and coming and finding him and sharing with him that I was on this path, like I was doing it, and he was very encouraging.  <br>Okay, so the majority of my pre-birth memory is of a time and again, time is difficult to speak to, but what we would say is a time somewhat immediately preceding this physical life where I had taken a long break. I remember this guide coming to me over and over again and asking, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And just kind of, like, getting my attention over and over, just like a gentle nudge, repeatedly asking, "Are you ready to return?"  <br>And saying, "No, I'm not ready to go back yet, I'm not ready yet." And finally being like, "Okay, I'm ready to go back." And then reviewing with this guide what I can only describe as so hard to describe, but my state, like, who I am, who I was, what I had experienced, and I could see and feel and know all these different types of experiences I had had and qualities you could say that I understood that I had.  <br><br><br>I don't want to use the word developed, but like, you know, aspects of being that I understood and had mastered versus other ones I had not. And there was this one specific vibration that was just like a huge, for lack of a better word, weak spot. I don't really want to put it that way because we are not weak as souls. There's no weakness, there's nothing lacking.  <br>But I could still see this one specific fear that had bested me in a previous experience. It was a certain negative vibration, like a negative self-perception, a certain type of fear that I had engaged, and it had overcome me in a previous experience. And it was like a very weak leg. You could say that I needed to walk on, not need to, but it would be beneficial for me to engage. It was obvious what I needed to do.  <br>But it was also like I could see even from there that the vibrational distance of this specific fear that I had experienced and that was within me was so low, like, so extreme in a certain way. And I was like, "Is it even possible to integrate, to process a fear that's this low?" And my guide shared with me, "Yes, and you have all time available to you to do so."  <br>It was just I knew that this is hard to explain, but there wasn't a limitation on my being. And there had been beings who had engaged vibrations this low and succeeded. And I knew, if it's even possible, I will do it. It sounds so strange to me as a human because I've experienced deep trauma and pain. But from that perspective, I, you know, I know, I knew. And I know now what we are. We can't be harmed. We are immortal spirit. That's what we... that's our true nature. It can't truly fail or be thwarted.  <br>And I just had this incredible excitement like, "I will do that. I'm so excited to do that." So they brought me a lifetime that was very appropriate, a very good match for that intention to meet that low vibration fear. And it wasn't this lifetime. It was like an immediately preceding life.  <br>I remember reviewing that life, reviewing a detailed plan of that life and then accepting that life, and then accepting what we call the veil, which is just a word, but it means the constraints in consciousness space that consciousness wears, adopts, takes on in order to have the physical experience.  <br>So the way I experienced it was like a plummet in vibration. Down, down, lower, lower, all the way down, lower, lower. I like to describe it like if you take a pitch-producing device, like a sound amplifier, and it's making a high pitch, and then you turn down the knob, and then when you get to the bottom, you turn it down some more and then more and then more and more and then crank it down some more. More and more and more.  <br>That's what it felt like in the body of my awareness vibrationally, to plummet down, down into this incarnated state. And as that happened, all of my knowing disappeared. All my knowing was cut off in my memory. And it felt like I lost all that I am.  <br><br><br>And so I arrived at this place that was so low vibration, so dark, so limited, that within moments, I responded in fear. I was like, "I'm not doing this. There's no way that I'm going to tolerate a lifetime of this." So I summoned my might, my strength, and I fought my way out. I pushed my way out past the veil, and I was successful in doing that.  <br>I immediately became aware that I had killed the body that was to be mine, the fetus, before it had even been born. And I had a life review for that, very, very short life. And I could see how my fear had impacted the mother by heaping grief upon her. And not only the mother, but I could see, like, ripples in a pond, hundreds of other people whose lives were made more difficult because of my fear.  <br>From that side, you know, that it's okay. There's nothing truly wrong. It's just a play. But I could see very objectively, like, "Oh, man, I got a lot of fear. I got to do something about this."  <br>So I maintained the intention to engage this fear, and I spent some time in what I've called a veil acceptance simulator. I know this sounds kind of wild, but there's, like, a room where you go and they put a mock veil over you, and you practice surrendering to it. Metaphorically, it was like being dunked underneath the dark water of a swimming pool and then holding your breath and seeing how long you can hold your breath, and then you can cry uncle if you want to get out and they'll let you out.  <br>So I did that for a while to practice allowing sufficiently so that I wouldn't repeat this... I don't want to use the word failure, but repeat this event of canceling and ending a life prematurely.  <br><br><br>So then after a while, they brought me this life as Christian. And I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail. I remember reviewing what I can only describe as, like, a flowchart, a huge flowchart that had millions and millions and millions of possibilities of how the life might actualize.  <br>So it's like if you took a tree and laid it on its side and started at the thick part of the trunk and worked your way out to the branches. It was like that. And there were events in it, but it wasn't focused on physical earthly events. It was more focused on what it would be like to be me, what it would be like to have the actual experience from the vantage point of Christian, the human being.  <br>Christian. And I could see that certain things were more likely and certain things were less likely. And I could see that it was very likely that a trauma would arise in my 20s that would crush me and give me the chance to re-experience this fear that I came to experience.  <br>And I was very excited, even though when that happened here in my life, it did actualize. I had a traumatic health experience in Chengdu, China, and it took me years to recover. I had post-traumatic stress and worked through that over years of counseling.  <br>So I do not make light of the depth of the difficulty and the rigor of the challenge that we might actually experience here, but from that perspective, I could see the opportunity. Like, the opportunity was just astronomically huge. If I could meet this experience and really process that fear, really integrate that experience, really bring love into it, really find joy and peace even here, even in the midst of that vibrational location, I just knew that it would enable a profound expansion of not only myself, but the whole.  <br>Because I'm a part of the whole. And the whole actually learns too. Maybe learn is a bad word. There's an expansive process happening, and I knew that by integrating this fear, I was participating not only in my personal expansion, but the expansion of all that is. And I was so excited.  <br>And I remember asking questions about the life. I made certain requests, like, for instance, I remember knowing that I had been intelligent in recent lives, and I asked if I could do that again, if I could be intelligent. And they said, "Yes, you could do that."  <br>And I knew that it would be important that I be male in this life. Not that men have any... it's just different qualities of being the masculine, and the feminine energy is just a different angle. And I just knew that the masculine angle had some... there was some use for that in order for me to meet this fear.  <br>And I also knew that my father in this lifetime would instill confidence in me and that he would really keep me very strong in that area of confidence, so that wouldn't be an issue. I knew that that would be helpful so that I would have a rock to stand on, so to speak, to meet the fear, and that my mother would be very loving.  <br>Okay? So then I remember there having to be a moment to say yes. And I don't remember that moment, but I do remember being in this waiting area and then this guide coming to me all of a sudden, like, "Go now," like, grabbing my attention as if he grabbed my shoulders and just gave me a really mighty shove. And I'm like, "Okay, now you got to get on Earth time now," kind of thing.  <br>And then being in this room that I can only describe as a mechanics shop or like a technician's chamber, and it was like this circular room over the earth. I could see a shaft below me, and the earth was below. And there were these beings there that I can only describe as technicians or tinkers. Tinker is probably a good English word for the feeling of them.  <br>And there are these very mechanically skilled... you could say energetic, energetic mechanics, skilled in that way for applying the veil. They're like veil technicians or something. And I remember being over this shaft and them asking me, "Are you sure you want to do this?" Because I knew once I said yes, I knew I was strapped in. I was in for the ride. Like getting on a roller coaster. Like you can't get off until the roller coaster comes to a complete stop. That kind of a thing.  <br><br><br>And I said yes. And then I remember that plummet in vibration. Down, down. Lower, lower, lower. Even lower. More. Lower once again. But this time I just focused on not fighting it. I was focused on surrendering to the veil and letting it take hold of me. And letting it do what it would do.  <br>And then after a while, feeling being in this place that I can only describe, like, the vacuum of space in the womb, it's just so dense and dark and obscured. And I remember from that place sending one message back to the technicians, "Did it take? Did the veil take?" And then getting one message back, "Yes."  <br>And I felt really accomplished, actually, because I knew that even making it to the physical, even achieving the vibrational state of being physical, was an accomplishment. And I was like, "Okay, I'm here." And it was like, "That's wonderful."  <br>But then after not too long, my fear began to arise once again because I was so limited, it was so dark, my knowing was cut off. It felt like I had lost all that I am. And so I began once again to summon my might, my strength, to fight my way out and reject the experience once again.  <br>As I did that, the most holy moment in my entire earthly life happened. The Spirit of God, what we call God the Source, that which is beyond all description, the profound, powerful, potent "I am" of all came to me and expanded me back out.  <br>And I felt all of the universe within me. I felt all the galaxies, all the stars. I felt them all within my body. I felt all that I am. And I felt our sun, Earth's sun. And I felt its churning bliss, had this, like, raging bliss is the word I would describe, just like fiery bliss.  <br>And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And it was such a holy moment. And I just thought to myself, "Well, that's amazing. That's wonderful. I don't have to fight." Because it was so relieving. I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I can let go."  <br>And I let go and just surrendered into being in the womb because I knew if I hadn't lost all that I am, that I didn't need to fight. So then I was in the womb for a while. It felt like a long while. And then the next memory I have is of the day I was born.  <br><br><br>I remember the sensory experience, just cold, shock, touching light. I remember looking up at the nurses and having absolutely no idea what was going on. Just being so confused and not understanding what were these shapes? What were these beings that were taking care of me? I knew they were some kind of living being, but I didn't understand.  <br>But I felt love for them, actually felt love for the nurses. And I remember just being super intensely curious. And it's funny because I shared this memory much later with my father. And he said when I was born, my eyes were wide open and I was looking at everything with the most intense curiosity he had ever seen.  <br>And I remember that. I remember being so curious about what is happening here. So I don't have much after that, but once I got a little bigger, I remember drawing upon these pre-birth memories in this flowchart and just to predict what was going to happen with simple things.  <br>Like, I remember wondering, "Is our neighborhood friend, our next-door neighbor, are they going to come over?" Like I'm talking when I was maybe three or four or something. "Are they going to come over today?" Just as an example and getting an answer because I was checking the flowchart about the likelihood.  <br>But I had certain expectations for how life on Earth would be based on what I remembered from the higher realms because I assumed that life here would be like there. For instance, I assumed that we would be able to feel each other's emotions here telepathically.  <br>And one time a neighbor friend was over. I remember being in a diaper and standing at this little couch, like sofa thing, and telling the neighbor there was this music on in the background. My father was playing the song on the radio on the record player. I even remember the song, and I remember telling the neighborhood friend, "Watch me dance."  <br><br><br>And I remember shaking my little tosh in my diaper and feeling really funky with the music. And she just walked away unimpressed. And when she did, I was like, "Oh my gosh." It occurred to me she can't feel what I'm feeling. And when that occurred to me, I was like, all of a sudden I felt like I was in a very alien world. Like, "What the heck is this place that we can't feel each other's emotions? What is going on?"  <br>Anyway, so that's just a summary.<br>
Oh, my goodness, this is so fascinating, and I have so many questions. Okay, so where to start?  <br>Okay, this veil, why do you think you remember? I mean, you did say that. Did it stick or something like that? Did the veil stick? But then you remember. So have you remembered this your whole life or no?  <br>All right, yeah, so I guess I should have included that. I'm sorry. When I was a small child, I remembered, but the memory left me completely by the age of five or six, and I had no memory of it at all until the age of 30. My body is 43 right now. It's about 13 years ago.  <br>It returned spontaneously after I took up a meditation practice and after I gained a deep familiarity with my awareness itself, just as it exists beneath all the thinking and stories and all the association, the form association. Then the memory just was there, and it was even more real than this, than any earthly memory. And it was so obvious. It was like the most obvious, normal thing.  <br><br><br>So why do you think that you particularly are remembering and not me, for instance, and all the other... so I'm not special. But I will say that in my pre-birth planning, I did ask to have to keep a small amount of memory. And they said that I could do that, but that it would make this life more difficult.  <br>And I could feel from that perspective why it's because the contrast between there and here would be even greater. Because if you have any glimmer of what home is like, the foreignness and the alienness of this state of being can become so painful that it can become intolerable.  <br>A lot of near-death experiences describe that very painful homesickness. Well, I feel that for sure. In a sense, the veil protects us because it prevents that really deep homesickness. But anyway, I don't consider myself special at all because we all are our deeper selves. We all are our higher selves.  <br>It's just that we've agreed to be veiled for a duration, for purposes of expansion. We've come to have the human experience, and that means signing up for complete immersion as complete as we can get. But despite the fact that it's very complete immersion, we've all made a similar choice and a similar journey, even if we don't remember it.  <br>When you forgot about the truth of who you were, were you an atheist then or did you have some sort of spiritual belief?<br>
Yeah, no, that's a good question. So, I mean, as I aged, my parents took me to a Lutheran church, and I always sensed there's something spiritual going on. I can't put my finger on it, but there's something going.  <br>We all feel it to one degree or another. So for a long time, I understood the world through a Lutheran lens. And I had very traditional Protestant Christian beliefs. In fact, I even considered going to seminary in my 20s. Even then, though, I just felt like I can't put God in a box, even though that's not a very small box.  <br>I still didn't feel comfortable completely committing to some kind of a structure, a limitation system, you could say. But I did believe. I did have Christian Lutheran mainstream beliefs for a long time, and a part of my early awakening process, I began to have out-of-body experiences, and I began to experience a deeper aspect of who I really am.  <br>And when I did, it took a lot of humility to first acknowledge all that I didn't know because belief in something to feel better is easy. It's hard to recognize, "Oh, man, I really don't know." And there's so much that you have to be willing to... you have to be very courageous, actually. And it's very humbling to drop an old belief system that you thought had all the answers because that was very helpful to the ego, actually, to help provide the answers.  <br>But I had to let that go. And another thing I had to let go, just as an example, in that same vein, I used to really trust in human understanding and in my intellect. I'd done all these things in my human life that on the human level seem like accomplishments. Well, I realized my intellectual ability meant almost nothing.  <br>What's important is love. The quality of being with which we meet this experience that then works with and shines through an intellectual context. It can use intellect. Fear or love can use the content of intellect. So anyway, I had to go through significant personal shifts, and it did very much affect those around me as well.  <br>Yeah, I can imagine that it is a big deal all of a sudden believing in something and then it all shifts because we are so in our heads about what we believe in. I mean, that's how we run our lives. What we act after and why we do certain things is because we believe certain things.  <br>But I assume that it must have also been an amazing experience.<br><br><br>Oh my gosh, yes. I was so excited to tell people that we are multidimensional beings having a human experience. I can't tell you, and I shared this in other videos, but I said to my wife, it sounds so silly now that I say this, and I know this isn't the way to reach people.  <br>But just as an example of how excited I was, I actually told my wife, "I'm going to make flyers, and I'm going to put them in people's mailboxes. And the flyers are going to say, 'You're a multidimensional being having a human experience, and you have nothing to fear, there's nothing to be afraid of, and you can live a life of love and joy.'"  <br>And I just wanted to go and put... and my wife's like, "Yeah, you're going to be that guy if you do that." I'm like, "Oh yeah, I'll be that guy." Of course, I did not end up doing it. I only considered that for a few minutes. But I'm just saying that I was so excited. I just wanted to tell people.  <br>And what was really interesting to me, I was always the Christian guy. I was very active in my church, and I was an assistant minister for like 20 years in my church. I taught confirmation class. I was on the church council. And so I found that when I shared what I experienced, which was an opening towards unconditional love, like an expansion of truly good news that there is nothing to fear and we cannot fail.  <br><br><br>But it was interesting because I would share that with some I knew that still retained a belief structure that was closer to my old one, and it was not well received in general.  <br>I actually had sort of the same experience the first times I was out of my body or actually the first time I really had a great experience out of my body. I woke up and I ran out on the street, and I was like, "I want to tell somebody exactly reality out there." No, I'm not going to do that.  <br>I totally get it. That's exactly how I felt. And then it's like, "But people need to know this. This is important stuff." And because those experiences, I think what a lot of people who don't remember experiencing that, I mean, we all do experience it, we just typically don't remember it. It's so real. It's so real. It's not a dream. It's actually more lucid, more real, more visceral, more tangible, more physical, actually, than the physical experience.  <br>So when you come back, it's like so self-evidently real that you just want to tell people.<br>
I'd love to go into that because I'm so curious about... again, I have to say where we really come from because I don't know how to explain it with my limited words and understanding because you mentioned so many details, like you were planning your life, this flowchart of a million possibilities.  <br>So in this room, are there rooms and how did it look like? And who were these guides? If you can just sort of give us a picture of some of the memory, how it looks like there and what kind of guides you were hanging out with and who are they?  <br>Let me just say this. So if you were to ask someone who's never been to Earth, "What does Earth look like?" Okay, well, first of all, they've never been there, so they can't even imagine what you're about to tell them. It's no language for it. And secondly, Earth has a lot of different contexts, a lot of different places, a lot of different potential situations.  <br>And these systems that I'm referring to are much less constrained. So they have far more potential of states of being and of experience than what we commonly experience on Earth. Earth is a very dense and limited experience by comparison. Okay?  <br>So on Earth, we experience an external environment with places. So we think reality is made of places. So I want to know what that place is like. And that's fine, that's an okay question because there are the experience of places, but it's far more than that.  <br><br><br>So I can just share a couple of small details. Okay? So when I was in the state before the guide came to me to ask if I was ready to go back yet, I remember being in a realm of living golden light, and my being was connected to it.  <br>And so then you say, "What were you doing in the realm of light?" Well, the only word I can think of in English is like, frolicking, just a joyful churning and expression of being and reaching out to places telepathically and instantaneously and then going and engaging in different things.  <br>But see, all time is also happening in one now, so it's far less limited. But then when the guide came and got to my attention, it wasn't like on Earth, like he had to walk up and like I had to see a face and then he had to say some words. That's not necessary at all because we're all connected.  <br>So there's this mental telepathic bridge, and he just came, visited me, and I knew he was visiting me even though I didn't need a visual experience for it. So I don't know if that helps.  <br>Different environments have... okay, so the other thing is these higher environments communicate. Thought-responsive environments tend to communicate to the individual in the experience language of the individual. So if you're a human... so if the human portion of you engages a non-physical environment, a thought-responsive environment, that environment may look like objects that you recognize to incredible detail.  <br>I'm not saying like they're amorphous, like I'm talking like scratches in the table level physicality to them, but in the symbolism and in the objects that mean something to you. So one thing that comes to mind is an example, and this is not an example, I don't have many examples of this, but sometimes when I have non-physical experiences, I like to try to prove it the next day.  <br>So if I'm interacting with somebody I know who is physically alive, I like to try to validate and verify that that interaction happened the next day, if I can, in the physical. And so one time, and this is the only time I was able to do this, at least so far, this woman who I'm close to, she ran a mediumship circle that I was a part of, and her and I were close, and we had had a non-physical experience together previously, spontaneously.  <br>So we set aside the intention to lay down, actually to get up at five in the morning, go back to sleep, and then while asleep to try to meet non-physically and see if we can intentionally have an experience. And I feel that we were able to have that experience and verify it because we both saw an environment that had incredible similarities to it.  <br>What I saw was a restaurant that looked like an old 1930s McDonald's and an old car that was probably from like the 1910s. But more than the visual, there was a feeling, because there's a lot of feeling... is a lot of feeling language you could say. So I described what I felt and saw to her, and she described that she was attempting to bring in an energy like that.  <br>And she saw a restaurant from like the... it was a different color, but we both saw very similar objects, and they meant something to each of us in a way that was more closely resembling whatever the message of that environment was. So that's a very simple example.  <br>Another example I can think of is one time I was out of body, and my attention began to drift to my earthly thinking and concerns. And I began to think about work, actually, while I was there. And suddenly I felt very trapped. Actually, let me rephrase. Suddenly I felt a little bit trapped, but because I was focused on the perception of being trapped, the environment I was in immediately became a dark prison cell with bars, rusty bars that had a physicality to them.  <br>And I realized, "Oh, I haven't gone to a place called a prison. I instantly manifested a prison because of the state of the vibration that I was entertaining." And see, we actually are all doing that all the time. It's just we don't know it here in the physical. It's a lot slower. It's a lot slower to manifest.  <br>But we're all actually wielding that creative power with our intention and belief and expectation all the time, which has a tangential comment, but it's important, which is one of the reasons why it's so important that we face our fear and that we remind each other of the truth of the fearlessness of our being.  <br>Because if we remember, we are truly free, joyful, powerful, loving beings, and we have nothing to be afraid of, as we get in touch with that, we are then better able to actualize that in our local environments. So I went down a long path there. I hope that spoke to your question.  <br>Yeah, you explain it so well, and I love that, especially being Norwegian. I'm like, "Oh, you have great English words." That I understand them, but I can't find them myself. Wow. All right. Okay. Law of attraction. So you would say that's very real.  <br><br><br>Yeah, I think we tend to dumb it down. We tend to oversimplify it. So basically, okay, consciousness is the substance. That is what I mean is the stuff that's the most real is spirit itself, consciousness itself. That's like the substrate of existence.  <br>And consciousness, what happens is consciousness moves, it does something. And that doing... I use the word intention. That just means a consciousness intends something, it moves in a direction. It seeks to do something or make some choice.  <br>Okay, the reason I start with that is because intention is at the root of manifestation. And so really, you could compare us. So sometimes when people think of Law of Attraction, they think, "Okay, I want a new car. So if I sit here and think, 'I want a new car,' I will get a new car."  <br>Well, it's not really that. The universe is listening to your surface-level thought, "I want a new car." What the universe is listening to is your intention, the quality of being with which you are being. So if you're seeking a new car, maybe what you're really saying underneath it is, "I'm afraid I won't have a ride, so I want a new car."  <br>So the universe is hearing the pitch of "I'm afraid I won't have a ride." And that's why processing fear is first, because then as we process fear, we open up the opportunity for much more loving and joyful expressions.  <br><br><br>So you might say that we're like soundboards that are producing because it's not just one pitch we're producing. You could say like hundreds of pitches all the time based on our intention, our beliefs, our expectations. And the universe is hearing them all, and it's responding to not only your pitches but the pitches of every other participant in the game.  <br>And there's a lot of them, but a focused, clear being-level deep... that means deep intention is a lot more powerful, a lot more effective than a surface-level thought muttering. If you're just going to sit there and just kind of mutter like a weak comment that doesn't really have the oomph to cause an effect, especially in the physical because the physical is so slow and dense by comparison.  <br>But if you're truly clear and especially if your intention is of love because love is the true power, it's reflective of the unity of being. So if we can really clear out all the crap and really bring forth an intention of love and peace just in this moment in whatever way, wow, that is powerful stuff.  <br>It has a manifestation potency that is much greater than actually many people who are not awake and who are not purposefully using that intention. So just some comments on what we typically call the law of attraction.  <br>Yeah, very interesting, and I'd love to share my thoughts on it and then you can play the tennis ball back and see if I'm on the right track because when I'm thinking about law of attraction and manifesting, I often feel that people's traumas are coming up.  <br>Like a couple now is trying to sell their apartment, and they've had so much trouble selling apartments before, and now it's difficult times, but still, I don't have problems with that. I've always had flow in apartment buying and selling my apartment, so it seems like I don't have so much resistance there, but it seems like they have, and now they're in totally interfere, and I'm like, "You got to manifest it."  <br>But as I was saying that, I just felt it's not so easy for them because they have so many experiences with not being able to sell their apartment, and each time they get into fear, and they get into trouble with those who are buying. There's always an issue with selling and buying apartments for that couple.  <br>So you're talking about meeting their fear. Is it the fear that's their problem or is it that they have so many experiences that it becomes a belief for them that it's very hard to sell an apartment for the price they actually need?  <br>Yeah, great question. So first of all, before I comment to the question at hand, it's not that every single thing in our lives is always a direct representation of just our intention. Of course, there are many different players in the game. All the laws of physics work. There's rules as to how the physical unfolds.  <br>So we might nudge the probabilities of something that might happen a lot, and maybe it moves from a one in 1000 chance to a one in ten chance, and it still doesn't happen. I'm using simple language, but I'm just pointing out that it's not just like a clear one-to-one. There's a lot of energy at work, and the divine laws at work are very effective. So just a context for the comment.  <br>Okay, so we do get what we expect and believe. You get what you expect might be a simple way to talk about manifestation. Okay. Like you said in the example. So fear is difficult for us to... so fear is another word for yet on evolving this. It's just another way to say it's something that we haven't yet integrated.  <br>And one of the great values of the physical is that you get what you fear. No, but that's not a negative. No, this is the place we come where we get so committed into... I don't want to use the word bound because we're never actually truly bound into the physical. It's just that when we do that so that we have the unrelenting opportunity, the unrelenting chance to face and process and integrate that which we haven't done yet.  <br>So if there is a primary fear that you're here to deal with, then it tends to keep rising back up into your experience. Maybe it's a fear of powerlessness, maybe it's a fear of not being worthy of love through relationship, whatever the rejection is. And it's not a negative that it keeps rising up, it's that you're afraid of it.  <br>So you're putting a lot of energy into it by resisting it. So you think you're trying to get away from it, but it's like building up a dam and then putting your energy in the dam throughout your whole life. Well, that's creating an effect because there's a cause and effect in all of our intentions and all of our thoughts and all of our association with form.  <br>So then it keeps coming up so that we have the opportunity to face it. In my case, the fear that I came to process is very, very deep and very personal. And I may deal with challenges that nobody else deals with because it's helpful, actually, so that I can meet this fear and have the opportunity to really get into it and to really experience it.  <br>And then once we do that, the dam is... we break the dam, and the flow of life opens up once again, actually even in greater measure. Because now we're not resisting life. Basically, we never have to be afraid of life or what's in life. We can say yes to life no matter what's arising.  <br>I know that's not easy, but if we say yes to everything that is arising, life can actually flow through us and show us where our own resistances are. We're actually deeper than... consciousness is deeper than all those hang-ups in life that we think need to be blocked off and that we need to run away from.  <br>And until we know that, until we experience it and really process it and really grow in measure, we'll keep blocking them. And because we've blocked them, the universe might just keep giving us nudges to help us process. But it's not a negative masochistic system or something.  <br>It's actually a very loving and intelligent system, and it tends to unfold and arise as it's beneficial for us to deal with. Not always, but in many cases, the challenges that arise arise at profitable moments, you could say moments when we're in a position where we can actually utilize the experience and respond to it and grow from it.  <br>So would you say that a way to manifest could be to really go into acceptance? Like Matt Kahn speaks about loving what is. So if you're afraid of not being lovable like you said, or being alone, maybe moving into surrender, that's the situation that is right now.  <br><br><br>I got to say something. This is important. Yes, absolutely. Acceptance opens the flow and is the power. Okay? But acceptance doesn't mean, "Oh, my gosh, I don't actually want to be alone, so I'm going to accept this because I want to escape it." That's not acceptance.  <br>What I mean is acceptance is actually feeling what you're feeling all the way, not running away from it, not trying to create a different outcome, honoring yourself 100%. "I feel this way. I have this legitimate feeling. This is exactly how I feel." And spending time with the feeling, rather than resisting it or trying to push it away. Go find it as it arises, just however it arises in this moment.  <br>So, as an example, if I might experience an anxiety that might arise from traveling is very difficult for me. And I had my traumatic experience happen during travel. So historically, I've had anxiety around the process of traveling, though that's healed so much.  <br>But now if I have an experience where I feel that rise up, like it might arise in my diaphragm, I feel a sensation of negative, like an anxiety, then I can just look at it and say, "Okay, almost. Thank you for coming. Show me where is my resistance? What am I afraid of?"  <br>And if you're really willing to feel into yourself, you'll usually find some pretty dark, nasty, scary gunk in there. But then the question is, what do you do with it? You don't have to solve it and fix it. Rather, it's asking for you to go see it, to go feel it, to go allow yourself to be vulnerable, to feel the aloneness or the powerlessness or whatever it is.  <br>Go towards it without requiring it to leave. It's like a messenger. Anxiety and fear, you could say, is like a messenger. It arrives at your door. And so often we open the door and we're like, "I don't like that," and close the door. And then the next time it comes back and it knocks a little harder, and then you open the door and you're like, "No," and you close the door.  <br>Well, it's not going to go away. I don't mean to oversimplify, this is a simple metaphor, but generally speaking, it won't go away until you open the door, welcome it in, come sit in the living room. And I would like to feel exactly why. What's the message you're delivering to me?  <br><br><br>Okay, this is the important thing. At the root, the message that the fear is delivering to you is a negative self-perception that is not in alignment with the truth that you've bought into, that you think life has proven to you.  <br>So for instance, if you're afraid of being powerless, that is not in alignment with the truth of who you really are. You are a powerful, immortal, multidimensional being. You can't be powerless. But you can experience fear when you associate with powerlessness because that's not native.  <br>And it's like, "Oh my gosh, I don't like that." Go into it and explore it because at the depth of it, you will find you are powerful. Or if your fear is being unworthy, shameful, unworthy of love, that is not true. You're so incredibly precious and worthy and worthy to be loved by all of creation.  <br>So then when you feel unworthy, it can prompt fear because "I don't like that. That's not who I am." It's not who you are. But what has the illusion seemed to prove to you? What fear has it allowed that you can then go into and feel and process and integrate.  <br>And as you do this, you don't have to do it all at once. You just meet the present moment. That's the key. The thing that you think you're missing, you're not missing. So the law of attraction is like realizing because until you know that you're not missing it, you're associated with missing it. You're associated with the lack.  <br>And so that's what is being focused on and created, but your true nature is not lacking at all.<br>
Does that mean also that you're never in the wrong place? It's always perfect where you are. No matter what's going on, it's perfect.  <br>So in one sense, yes, in another sense... I don't want to make it sound like the system is perfect because that's not true either. But that's really hard to talk about. Basically, the simplest way to put it would be, yes, you are exactly where you are, and there's reason for exactly where you are.  <br>And the divine laws that are at the root of all things are built on wisdom and love. And so things are all flowing according to those divine laws. Just put it that way. According to plan. But sometimes the plan doesn't... I didn't say according to plan necessarily. Right. That's what I mean.  <br>Maybe because I've read some book by Dolores Cannon where I got the understanding that sometimes the spirits were saying, "Yeah, this is not sort of supposed to happen, but sometimes it happens." And I'm like, "Absolutely, the system perfect." Okay. Yeah. So it's not because no, this is why, though.  <br>The substance of the system, spirit itself, is perfect, but it's engaging a non-native set of forms in order to expand itself. Okay. So then as it engages that non-native state set of forms, it's committing into a circumstance set, into a constraint set.  <br>And so pre-life, when I looked at the flowchart, I could see all these probabilities because the system is really, really good at predicting outcome. But what is the thing that changes the outcome? Free will. You get to make choices. I get to make choices.  <br>Now, the system knows us really well, so it's pretty darn good at predicting the choices that we're likely to take. But it is a novel system. In fact, this is really important, actually, the novelty of the physical, the fact that novel outcomes can happen. That means unanticipated outcomes can happen.  <br>That is the value, you see, because now you have a perfect all that is, that knows all. But now it's engaging something. It doesn't know what's going to happen, it doesn't understand what's going to happen, and it has to make choices and wield choices and see what the outcomes of those choices are.  <br>And then, "Oh, something surprising just happened. That's amazing. That's exciting. Now what are we going to do?" And that process adds to all that is. You see that novelty adds to all that is. So it's not perfect and that everything is preset. It's very, very good.  <br>But it's actually rather precious that all of us here on Earth are making choices from a place that we don't fully see. We're having to play on the fly, so to speak, and we're seeking, and then at the root of the whole game, we're trying to see if we can make choices that are more in alignment with love, with our true nature, than fear, which is association with the non-native illusion and unworthiness.  <br>We're trying to see if we can be loving even here. And we're trying to integrate these experiences, really come to terms with what is it like to be me? What is it like to be a father or a friend or a son or a shopkeeper or a person playing in mud or someone who has broken their leg?  <br>What is it like to be that person, and what choices do you make from it? That is the frontier of creation.<br>
Wow. Yeah. And I read in your book that part of what we're doing here and how we're growing is by making these choices and expanding our... we're expanding by expanding our vocabulary, experience vocabulary.  <br>Yeah. You can see... yeah. Destiny. So you speak about probabilities. You had millions of probabilities. That's a lot to choose from. I was thinking about that when you watched all these millions of possibilities?  <br><br><br>Well, it's not like I chose from them all. It's more like I could see what was... I'm choosing. Now you see, now I'm 43 years into the simulation, and after this, I get to decide, am I going to go down and make dinner? Am I going to go take my guinea pigs outside and put them in the lawn, or am I going to go for a walk?  <br>Okay. How does destiny come into this? I'm curious about that. So I know you're married, right? So yes. Do you have a soul contract then? Is that something you remember, that you had a soul contract? That you were... you talked about your father, your mother. Did you also choose your spouse?  <br>Because it seems easier to choose your mother and father. They're ready to have a kid, and you come down.<br>
Yeah, the mother and father are very close to the start point because they're generating the body. But then life happens, and people make their free choices. So what if that messes up all the plan?  <br>So there's one concept that might help here. So when we set the plan at the beginning, we set key intentions, and the probabilities of the life tend to support those pre-life intentions. So in my case, my intention was to be physically crushed by illness and to experience this fear.  <br>It sounds horrible to the human ego, but actually, it's a wonderful opportunity. So what that means is, since that was my intention, the circumstances of the life and body were likely, very likely to support that as manifesting in one way or another.  <br>Now I can see it was very likely that by my early 20s, once the body got over... it's like just over, just over the peak of its biological growth, 22, that this would have happened to me. I could feel that from that point of view. Okay.  <br>As for meeting my wife, I don't have any memory of that specifically. But it's not that every single aspect of our lives is a primary part of the contract. It's more like the contract is a primary thing or things... multiple, it could be multiple things that we want to experience, and then the life tends to work more around those things.  <br>Some people do come to play certain roles for each other, to be in certain relationships. Well, then it's very likely... not 100% certain, never 100%. It could be 99.99%, might be 80, I don't know. But some likelihood that we will come across and meet that person and engage in a relationship with that person if that was beneficial to us.  <br>Often the people that we reincarnate with to re-experience relationship have been beneficial for our own growth in some way, and we have a loving relationship with them already. So maybe we've already been parent and child, or maybe we've already been spouses, and now we want to experience each other from a different angle.  <br>That is something we often do. In my case, that was not a part of my pre-birth plan. I was coming to do something more personal when it came to engaging fear.<br>
That makes sense because I feel that from what I've learned that everything is very unique and special to the soul.  <br>That's probably why there's so many different stories and near-death experience stories and soulmates and twin souls. I feel like there are some who are very focused on that who are maybe incarnating together again and again in different... you believe that too? That happens.  <br>I mean, I think that a lot of times, especially with romantic relationships, we tend to very quickly want to identify the twin flame, the soulmate. I'm not making light of that. Sometimes that is the case. It's just that if we pre-plan some kind of a relationship experience, it's likely that that will unfold.  <br>But it's not always the case. I mean, we are all one. We're all connected to each other. We're all loving brothers and sisters. We're all family. Like every single person listening today, you and I are family. We just don't remember it. And we have varying degrees of experience with each other. That's all beautiful. You know what I mean?  <br>That's true. Okay, so can we take on too much?<br>
The short answer is yes. But the thing is... okay, so the guides are really good at working with us to try to bite off an optimal amount of sandwich. Okay. Because if it's too easy, there's not maybe as much opportunity for expansion and personal growth.  <br>But if it's too hard, it's just going to crush us. It's like if you go down to lay on a weight bench, you don't start with 500 pounds. You don't do that. That's not going to be beneficial to you. It's only going to hurt you.  <br>See, the soul is kind of... I mean, it's a crude metaphor, but the soul is a little bit like that. Like it gains capability, depth of being, virtues. You could even say it gains experience in different avenues, and so then it wishes to expand in a certain way.  <br>So when we first start, you could say that we just want to get some experience and get started. So we get in. We might take a more... I don't want to use the word routine life because every life is unique, but we might just take whatever we can, and then as we evolve and grow, we might take more and more specific goals because now that's something that I would really like to experience and learn.  <br>Now, is it possible to take on too much? I mean, yes, there are unfortunately... well, I don't even want to use that word unfortunately. I'm not trying to judge this. In fact, I honor it very much. But there are thousands of people who commit suicide every day, right?  <br>Because they have become overwhelmed in some way. It could be biological limitations, could be circumstantial limitations that led to biological limitations. It could be upbringing, it could be unforeseen trauma. There's lots of reasons.  <br>And then the personality might get wrapped more and more and more into a smaller and smaller worldview, a smaller box, a form association that gets deeper and deeper and more and more painful. Because the more we associate with the limited, the further and further we actually are going vibrationally from the truth of our being, which is quite free and unlimited and full of peace and joy.  <br>So sometimes we get wrapped in patterns so much that the weight of the experience may be too great for us. In my case, this fear that I'm here to process, it did best me. You could say in a previous experience, I was a very... not helpful person in a previous life with this fear.  <br>And that was how I knew that I had this much fear and that it would be beneficial for me to work on because I could see that I had been a very damaging egoic, you could even say an egoic monster in this previous life. And so now I'm seeking to integrate that same fear.  <br>And I'll just say one other thing that might be useful. So I don't have many specific memories of previous lives, but I do remember being a woman, a human woman who had given birth a first time, and it had been very painful. And then being pregnant a second time and being terrified of having to give birth and having to go through that pain again.  <br>Because that fear is the same exact fear that I experienced in this life. Laying in a hospital bed in Chengdu after having a heat stroke and having my neurology feeling like it was dying. The circumstances are different. Both of them were a fear response to being unable to escape pain.  <br>That's the fear is my rejection of pain, my rejection of having to suffer. So I went down a bit of a tangent there, but I'm just saying in that past, it may have overcome me, but the thing is now it's an opportunity. See, ultimately, everything is used ultimately for the good. The system is very efficient.  <br>And still, I just want to address what you mentioned, that some people are making that choice of leaving this life, and many have been thinking about it. Like, I just spoke to a doctor who said, "I hear this all the time. I think a lot of people are entertaining that thought even."  <br>Is that part of the free will as well? Or do you know anything about from what you remember? Do you need to go back and do it all again? Do you have any thoughts about suicide?  <br><br><br>First of all, I'm not making light of the utter rigor and pain that can be experienced in this life. I have experienced incredible pain. I have neurochemical issues sometimes, and I've experienced lows that are so painful. I totally understand why someone would want to kill their body and just to get some relief.  <br>So I'm not at all making light of it. That being said, suicide is not an escape. And what I mean is, the opportunity is now. We may be very far down a certain trajectory into pain and into limitation and into an association with believing you are powerless or unworthy.  <br>And look, I have a lifetime to prove it to me, and it happens every day, and it's so... I'm not making light of that depth of momentum. But now this moment is a new moment. A new moment to change the momentum and to stop and to pause, because your true nature is deeper than all that horror and pain.  <br>Your true nature is love and freedom and joy. Okay, I know that's a mighty step, a Grand Canyon between the darkness of deepest depression and the native love and joy. That vibrational distance is ridiculously huge. But in that distance is the opportunity to surrender, to accept, to choose something new, to choose maybe service to another instead of fretting over yourself or something for a moment.  <br>I don't mean to make light of that or to choose to do... to choose joy in some small way or to choose simply to endure even the pain and to know that it's temporary and it will get better. It will go away. It's not who you are. The pain is not who you are.  <br>You could say depression is like a lie. It's like a neurochemical lie. I know that when you're in it, you can't feel good. You can't even feel good. I understand. But you could say that even there, you get to wield an intention. You get to wield a state of being in that, and it's like there's a Bashar quote I love.  <br><br><br>"Circumstances don't matter. Only state of being matters." And you get to choose your state of being in any moment. You can shift that momentum.  <br>Okay, so now to your question, what's the implication of suicide? I cannot possibly speak to that in one swoop. I can simply say that where there is yet unaddressed fear, it is beneficial for us to go and process it and heal it.  <br>And so often when we're in the depths of the darkness is the most valuable opportunity. And so it is valuable to stay and to do everything that we can to meet that. That being said, I'll also say that unconditional love is unconditional.  <br>It's not like you get to the other side and it's, "You messed up." No, those on the other side, they see the pain, the rigor. It's like if someone goes to Mount Everest and climbs Mount Everest and they're like, "It's cold up here." Yeah, it's cold up on Mount Everest.  <br>Do you feel like if they come back down and they didn't make it all the way to the summit, do you judge them and say, "You didn't do well enough." No, we understand. They tried something incredible, they tried something mighty. And that's how it is to be human, and especially to be human into certain depths of darkness.  <br>It's like climbing Mount Everest. Yes. It's cold and there's no air up there. The question is, what do you do with it when it's cold and there's no air? It's not like you can fail. You can't fail climbing Mount Everest, you know what I mean?  <br>Whether you make it halfway up or all the way to the summit, it's a valuable experience either way. And then later you get to choose. You get to choose if you would like to return and do it again.  <br>Yeah. When I was very depressed in my 20s, I had some thoughts around it. But I had a family that I loved, and I just knew I could never do it. But I wanted to just escape the pain of not feeling anything and not seeing any hope in my life.  <br>But I had a thought, like, "What if in the future there's something in store for me, and I would regret this?" And here I am today, doing something I never thought I would do, and I wouldn't have done this if I wasn't depressed. I would never have asked the big questions.  <br>So it started this spiritual journey for me, and now I have this platform and sharing these messages.<br>
Yeah. I feel that life is so brilliant. So today I see the purpose with my depression.  <br>A lot of people who experience depression or other neurochemical imbalances are the most spiritually sensitive among us because there's different depths to which you can dive into the physical. There are different depths of experiencing even physical contrast.  <br>Like, I'm a very sensitive person, so I experience things more intensely than the average human being. There's so many substances, even sources of light, things that I can't tolerate, that other people have no problem with. But see, all the contrast is valuable.  <br>So I'm just saying that it's often the spiritually mighty, the strongest among us who go all the way into the dark. And I've heard Natalie Sudman, the near-death experiencer. She said that in her near-death experience, she saw that humans, especially those who are doing these great challenges, are seen like fighter jet pilots who are flying their jets upside down, 20 feet off the ground.  <br>Just incredible, incredible acts of expression and creativity and growth and ultimately the service of love and joy. That is who we are. And that love and the joy that we are, it cannot be truly overcome. The deepest, darkest depression is not deeper than it.  <br>No matter what kind of image you put on a movie screen, you can't actually harm the screen. You can't actually get deeper than the screen. And similarly, if we allow and fully feel even the deepest darkness and fully forgive ourselves, and fully forgive those around us and fully honor the journey we've had to come this far.  <br>Holy crap. We really honor it, really feel it, feel it all. You can process all that here and grow in that way and now forever. You can know that depth, that new space that you... I don't want to use the word carved out in experience space. You can heal and grow through that.  <br>And when we do that all the way, there is only peace and love and joy left. Love and peace and joy is always possible, even if we are in a moment of absolutely incredible pain and hopelessness.  <br>Beautiful. What is the meaning of life from your perspective?<br>
The simplest way to put it is love. Love is the reason the physical universe is that. The purpose of it is the expansion of love and joy through the integration of experience and through choice-making, seeking to make choices out of love rather than fear.  <br>Wow. It has been such a joy speaking with you. Christian, thank you so much for sharing. I watched your show back in the day before I had even shared my experience, I don't know, four or five years ago now. I loved your show, and I was encouraged.  <br>And every time I see people share, I think... I meet a lot of people now that reach out to me, and they share their experiences. We are not alone. There are a lot of people out there who have experiences, and it's okay, this is normal.  <br>We really are spiritual beings having a human experience. And so many people just don't feel like there's a way they can share it or that it can be validated. So I really appreciate that. Like all those little nudges of seeing your show and watching, like, boot at the gas pump, that was another one for me.  <br>That's really valuable work because this type of activity, sharing the real message and helping to remind people of who we really are, this is the real work. Consciousness is first. The form is second. So if we can find that love and that peace and that joy and meet our own crap and encourage people to do that, we are healing the world.  <br>This is the real. It's the same for me. Like I just told you, it's a bit personal. It was part of me that lost some curiosity for a while. And then I started listening to sort of near-death experiences. And I came over your experiences, and all of a sudden something opened up within me again, and I started becoming curious again.  <br>And I think there's a reason for everything because I had to build my company. Now we have a membership, we have online courses. I really had to sort of step into the businesswoman and make decisions and create the company. It was a lot of hard work.  <br>But now that that's sort of in place, I feel like I have the space again to be curious again.<br>
That's wonderful. And that's okay. If it comes and goes, that's okay.  <br>So how can people reach you? What are you working with? I don't even know, actually, what you're doing. I just read your book. But what are you doing for a living? Are you working with this?  <br>So right now I work full-time as a project manager for an insurance company. But I intend to move away from that. Yeah, I did project management for a nuclear valve and pump manufacturing company for 16 years. Took six months off.  <br>But I am so passionate about this work, and I do intend to move. I am in the process of moving more and more into this space. It is such a joy-filled work. I've got to meet so many amazing people.  <br>So how can people reach me? So I have a website. A Walk in the Physical.com? There's a book page. My book is available online for free as a readable PDF on Google Books. Just go to the third link down on the book page. It's also on Amazon in print or Kindle or audiobook.  <br>It's not about money. I just want to share the message. And if you'd like to email me, I'm happy to try to respond. I'm sorry. Sometimes I get so many emails, I just cannot respond to everybody. I apologize, but I'm happy to respond to as many as I can.  <br>It's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a><br>

 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=Dy8jvI5Gu7I  <br>23 FEB 2023<br><br><br>Today my guest is Christian Sundberg, and you guys, on a scale of one to ten, I am an 11 excited to talk to Christian because it was over three years ago that I encountered an interview unlike any interview I had ever heard before, where he was talking with Mayor Kelly. I'm gonna post this up here if you want to connect to Christian's longer full story. He's going to tell a little bit of an abridged version of his story today because we have so many questions I want to be able to ask him. He has also written a book called A Walk in the Physical, which I have read and I highly, highly recommend, and I'm going to share a way at the end that you can even get it for free.  <br>Welcome! I am so excited to have you here. Thank you for joining me.<br>
Thank you so much. It's great to be here.  <br>Thank you. So, Christian, I'm gonna let you just go ahead and tell your story in whatever way you would like to share it because Christian is very unusual. He remembers his pre-birth, prior to coming to this earthly incarnation. He remembers many things about his soul before his incarnation on Earth, and I'm just excited to hear the story.  <br><br><br>Sure, thank you. So, like you said, I'll try to be brief because it's a long story. But before I start, I also want to say that words cannot possibly articulate what I'm going to attempt to say. That's really important to state up front as a disclaimer because words are form. You know, they're symbols that belong to our local context, and they're based in the assumptions of our context here on Earth, like linear time and discrete location and all these things that we take for granted. Our language is based on that world, and we transcend it fully. So there is just no way that any language, any utterance, can possibly touch our higher natures or the higher spiritual context from which we come. So I just have to say that first.  <br>Okay, so my body is 42 years old right now. When I was 30 years old, I took up a long-term meditation practice, and much to my surprise, after several months of meditating, I began to have non-physical experiences, out-of-body experiences, and I also began to have pre-birth memory return to me. I remember choosing this life and why, and it was just like the most normal thing in the world to have this come back to me. It was like someone had just blown leaves off of the ground, and there was the grass. It was just so normal, unexceptional, and yet it was so powerful.  <br>So I'll try to share just at a high level, but again, it's just so impossible to put into words. So I remember long ago, and when I say long ago, I mean like eons and eons ago, and yet simultaneously right now. I know that sounds strange, but this memory is like a living state of being almost that occurred so far in the past and yet is occurring now.  <br><br><br>I remember coming across a being who had been physical, and this was before I had had any physical incarnations. I was deeply, deeply inspired by the quality of his nature, his essence, who he was, like what he was. And I was like, "My goodness," because in that state of being, you can feel and share all of our natures. Our natures are telepathically exchanged and shared because we are ultimately one. So even as we're individuated, we feel and know what it is to be the other person in ourselves too because they're a part of us.  <br>And so I asked him telepathically, "Oh my goodness, how did you become this? Do you feel as much joy and freedom and power as I feel that you feel?" And he shared, "Yes." And I felt in him all this amazing depth of being, this quality of being. And I said, "My goodness, what could you possibly have done to be this and to experience this?"  <br>Well, he shared many things, but one of the things he shared was that he had been physical. He shared one physical experience in particular in which he had been suffering from a long-term illness of some kind, some kind of pain that stuck with him for many years. The quality with which he met that pain and that limitation allowed a certain refinement of his being. I don't know how else to describe it. And I was so inspired. I said, "Okay, I want to do that. I want to do that."  <br>And you know, at first, he kind of brushed me off almost, like not in a negative way, but kind of like, "Yeah, that's what they all say. You don't know how hard this is. Hard in a way that you just don't understand. You just haven't been exposed to this. You just don't understand what this means." I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do this." And he said, "Well, go talk to your guides."  <br>So I did, and I don't remember right after that, but I know I lived many times after that experience. Okay, so then the majority of this pre-birth memory is of a time somewhat immediately preceding this life. I had lived before, and I had taken a long break. I remember this guide coming to me over and over again and asking me if I was ready to go back yet. "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" Just every once in a while, and just responding, "No, no, I'm not ready." Like being hesitant to, you know, end a long weekend or something. I don't know. I mean, it's a bad analogy, but like I was just not ready yet.  <br><br><br>And eventually, I said, "Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready now." And I reviewed with this guide what I can only describe as my state, like who I am and who I've been, and like the qualities that I know. I don't want to say like possess. It's not like that, but there are areas that I have experienced and grown and integrated and evolved, and others that I had not. But there was really one obvious thing that I could see, just very matter-of-fact, that I needed to work on. I don't like the words "work on" either because that makes it sound like it's like a to-do list or something. It's not like that, but I could see that there was this profound opportunity for growth and expansion in one certain direction that before had bested me and overcome me.  <br>The best way I can describe it is it was a specific fear that in the past had overcome me. There was a lifetime that it had overcome me, and I had become a very egoic person, and I had damaged many others in that experience. And so I could see even from there, like the depth of the lowness of the vibration of the sphere was so low that I was like, "Is it even possible? Is it even possible to integrate a vibration that's that low, to really integrate and come to a state of being, an integrated state of being, that's that low?"  <br>And I was shown, "Yes, and you have all time available to you to do so. There's no hurry." And I just knew in my being, "Well, if it can be done, I'll do it. Like, if it can be done, I will do it." Like, I just knew my strength, my immortality, my freedom, my power, my life. I knew it could be done, which, you know, sounds strange to the human part of me sometimes, knowing what I've experienced.  <br><br><br>But anyway, so I knew that that was an incredible opportunity. So they brought me a life that was appropriate for that intention, to meet that fear and to integrate that low vibration. And I reviewed that life, and I accepted that life. And then I accepted what we call the veil, which is just a term for the limitations in consciousness space that go along with being incarnated and having a body.  <br>It's like, and this is so hard to describe, but it's like wearing a cloak or something that erases all of your memory and makes you feel disconnected from all knowing and disconnected from everything else. And I like to describe it like a shift in vibration down from a very, very high state of being down to a low state. Like if you had an amplifier or that's not the right term, but you know, some box that produces a pitch, and then you turn down the dial to the bottom, and then when you get to the bottom, you turn some more, more and more and more, lower, lower, lower, and then more, and then turn a lot more, more, more, more, more. That's how it felt in the body of my awareness to go from this state of incredibly high vibration down, down, down, down, lower, lower into the state of being that felt like arriving to a vacuum, like the vacuum of space, and yet simultaneously very dense and small and just incredibly dense.  <br>So I had that experience for this lifetime I'm describing, but it wasn't this lifetime. It was just before this. And I arrived there, and within moments, I was like, "I am not doing this. There is no flipping way I am going to endure this. This vibration is so low. I don't feel like myself. I've lost everything." And I had a whole bunch of fear rise up. I just had so much fear.  <br><br><br>So I summoned my might, and I smote the veil. I smote the limitations, and I fought my way back out. And I became aware that I had killed the fetus that was to be my body. I had a life review. I could see how the fear that I had acted upon and brought into that experience affected not only the mother, who was in grief, but hundreds of other people, like in ripples away from the mother, whose journeys all were made more difficult because of my fear.  <br>And like, I had all these great intentions, but I could see and feel very plainly that I had only made their journeys more difficult. And I respected and loved them so much, and I had only made it more difficult for them. You know, and I thought, "Oh man, I mean, from that side, you know, that everything is okay. Like, you can see and feel, and you just know it's okay. Everything is okay. It's just like a big play. Everything's fine." But yet, objectively, I could just see, "Oh my gosh, I've got a lot of fear. I got to do something about this."  <br>So then they brought me this life after, after a time. I spent some time practicing surrendering to a veil in like a simulator, and then they brought me this life. And this life was not as optimum as the first one would have been, but it was still pretty good. It was good enough. It was good for the purposes, but I just knew that it wasn't quite as optimal as the first one would have been.  <br>And I reviewed this life in incredible detail, like millions and millions of possibilities. It was like a flowchart. Language is so limiting here, okay, but it was like a vast flowchart of millions of branches, energetic branches. And it was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side and started at the trunk and worked your way out to the branches. <br><br><br>It was like that, except these were probabilities, like there were paths that were more or less probable. And the thing that made them more or less probable and that could affect their outcome is free will—my choice-making and the choice-making of everybody else in the whole simulation. It was all a part of it.  <br>But there were certain energetic seasons and patterns happening. I could see and feel like the human race is going through a certain energetic pattern, and my life would have a certain energetic pattern. And I knew that it was likely that a trauma would befall me in my 20s and crush me and give me the chance to re-experience that fear. And that did happen in this life.  <br>So I reviewed the life in detail, and then I was in a waiting area. I remember the guy coming to me and saying, "Go now, like right now. Right now, you gotta get on Earth time." And then being in this place I can only describe like a technician's shop or like an auto shop, but it felt like it was up in space. There was this shaft in the middle, and where the Earth was below. And I remember the guy, these beings—I don't know if I call them guides or more like technicians or something—saying to me, "Are you sure? This is like the last chance button. You say yes here, you're strapped in for the ride kind of thing."  <br><br><br>And I said, "Yes, I'm ready." And then once again, feeling that incredible plummet of vibration down, down, down, lower, down, lower still, more and more, more, and having all of my knowing be cut off and feeling dark and separate and alone. And I can't describe the density and simultaneous emptiness of this state of being by comparison.  <br>So I arrived here in the physical. I was just basically trying not to fight the veil this time because of what I experienced last time. And after just letting it be and letting it overcome me, eventually I sent a message back to the technicians, "Did it take? Did the veil take?" And they sent one message back, "Yes." So I knew I'd made it, which is like already a huge accomplishment. Like, I knew even just making it here and being incarnated was like, "Oh, that's awesome. I made it. I made it."  <br>So I was here for a while, and then eventually, I was like, "You know what? I am not doing this once again." It was like, "This is not happening. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I have lost everything that I am. I am not doing this." And that fear rose up once again. And so I was preparing to find my way out again when I had the most holy and beautiful moment of my life.  <br>I felt the great power, the Great I Am, the source of all that is—what we call God for a profound lack of term—come to me and expand me back out and show me all of the universe. And I felt it all within me, and I felt all the galaxies and all the stars, and I felt the churning of our sun, Earth's sun, and the bliss of being that the sun was—the churning bliss of being.  <br>And the spirit said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." I just knew it in my being, and I was like, "Oh my gosh, that's wonderful." I knew that I had nothing to fear. Like, if this is still what I was, I hadn't lost everything that I was. Like, that was what I was afraid of and rejecting—this state of being in which I felt like I had lost all that I am.  <br><br><br>So that calmed me. I was okay. That's wonderful. And so I let go and settled back into the experience of being in the womb. And the next memory I have is of being born. I remember the shock, the brightness, I remember the cold, I remember being touched, and just being overwhelmed with sense data but having no idea what was going on. Just like, "What is happening?" But being super curious. I remember looking up at the nurses and wondering, "Who are these beings that are taking care of me?" But just having absolutely no idea what was going on and staring very intently and trying to analyze everything.  <br>I remember that, and it's funny because my father has told me that since I've shared the story, he said, "Oh yeah, your eyes were wide open. You were staring at that." Like, he's like, "I never saw such an intense gaze." And he said what occurred to him was, "Who is this being who has come, you know, as a human?" Because, you know, to most people, they don't think of the idea that we pre-exist right before being physical.  <br>But I remember that curiosity and that intensity, and then not much after that. But then as I grew in the first few years of my life, I had memory of this, and that memory left me by the age of like five or six. But until that age, I assumed everybody knew we weren't from here. I just had this knowing, this sense, like, "This is just a play. We're just coming to do a neat thing. Everybody must know it, but nobody talks about it." You know, so I didn't talk about it, but I had certain assumptions that I carried with me that I assumed would be true here because of how things are in the higher realities.  <br>Just as an example, I remember feeling that it would make sense. It should be that people in positions of authority or leadership or teaching should be loving and wise. You know, so the higher you were in society, you must be a more loving and wise being. You know, well, that's not always how it works on Earth. I have to remind myself of that.  <br>I feel like even today, I still am trying to come to terms fully with what this Earth experience really is and where our society really is at. But anyway, so that's just, you know, a short sharing of that story. I know people are interested to hear the story. I'm happy to share it, but I don't really think it's the most important thing that we can talk about, that we can share. I think what's far more important is to share with each other a reminder of who or what we really are.  <br>You know, everyone listening today, this is about like every one of us is on an incredible journey in the physical, and who we really are vastly transcends the physical context and the physical limitations. We are immortal beings of love. We are multi-dimensional, creative, powerful, loving beings, and that cannot be emphasized enough. You know, we get super veiled while we're here. We get super dense. We don't see it in front of our faces every day. We're very associated with the form—the form of Earth, the visual experience, the shapes, the ideas, all the ideas, all the news, all the consumers, and all the food, and all the things. We're really deeply associated with that, but that's not what we really are.  <br>You know, we really vastly transcend the story of the human condition. It's just a story that we embark upon for great purposes, for the purposes of the expansion of love and joy. It's a wonderful process.  <br>Yes, oh my gosh, Christian, thank you for sharing that story. First of all, I'm glad that you brought that up about the beauty and the magnificence of what we are. People who watch my channel, if you've seen my videos, you understand that I've had experiences that have actually proven that, so it's not a faith thing about the magnificence of what we are. But one of the things that I've talked about a lot is that I feel like the souls who choose to come to Earth—because I know it's not all souls—are considered on the other side. We are looked at as like the daredevil souls of the universe because so many souls will not take on that veil because it's unfathomable to be disconnected from what we are, which is not an experience of love. It is actually a state of being of being loved.  <br>So can you speak to that a little bit about the daredevil souls and how rare you feel it is, on a soul level, for souls to incarnate here on Earth?  <br><br><br>I agree completely with what you just said. I don't know the prevalence. I couldn't put a number on it obviously, but I do know that it is the minority of souls that would undertake something this extreme. You know, because the state of being that we're in right now is extremely separate—extremely separate. Like, we feel separate. We actually individuated. We made it all the way as far as we can take it into separation.  <br>Right, we've come so far that, like, the listeners today, probably whoever you are, you may assume we are separate people. Like, that's just so, you know what I mean? Like, these objects are separate. I got this object, this, but the thing is, that is just going very, very far in a certain extreme experiential direction. It's not really native to what we are. It's like putting on an astronaut suit or something and going into an extreme environment.  <br>Like, not everybody wants to go into space. You know, not everybody wants to wear an astronaut suit and go into space and get cramped and maybe live on a space station for three years and eat food out of a tube and, you know, put poop in a bag or whatever. Like, not everybody wants to do that, go to outer space and do that. We did choose to do that, and it is the minority.  <br>So I agree, we are seen in a way like there's a near-death experience or named Amy Call. I really love her NDE. Fantastic NDE, and she says something to this effect that from the other side, we're seen as superheroes. And I think it was Natalie Sudman, actually, another near-death experiencer, who said that we're seen like fighter jet pilots who, I think she said, was like flying a fighter jet upside down 30 feet above the ground.  <br>You know, well, yes, I agree with that, and it's because the extremity of the limitation that we've agreed to experience here is so extreme. It's like not everybody on Earth is going to go climb Mount Everest. Like, no, I personally have no interest in attempting that level of difficulty. It may be like that a bit.  <br><br><br>Now, you might say, "There's billions of people on Earth." Well, there are a lot of souls. I don't know how many souls, but it's far, far more than avatars available on Earth to play. Definitely. Well, so then that's kind of an interesting thing also. So the population hasn't decreased over time; it's increased, which means if we have multiple lives, everybody here couldn't have all had multiple lives. There haven't been that many people that have been on Earth.  <br>So one of the things that I was shown, and I'd love to hear your take on this, when I was on the other side, I was with a being who showed me the Earth, and the Earth looked very far away. And the being was explaining that the Earth is evolving, and there's an evolution level, and about—and I'm going to put a percentage on it because it's how I, it's only the way it can again work completely difficult—but 20% of the souls are very highly evolved souls that are here to kind of wake up the rest of the planet, and the other 80% are newer souls who have not had very many physical incarnations, are coming here for the first time.  <br>And I think that it makes sense, and it's not an ego thing. Please do not mistake this for an ego thing because it's easy when you talk about this to say, "Oh, so somebody who's here is better." There is no good, better, or best on the other side. That doesn't exist. But would you agree that maybe a lot of the people who are on this planet right now are what you would refer to as newer souls or souls who have not incarnated hundreds or thousands of times like some of the other souls?  <br><br><br>I have no idea, but I would say that there are those who have a lot more experience, higher evolved souls who have come to help. I remember knowing on that side that the awakening was happening. Can you talk to that a little bit?  <br>That's so interesting because, yeah, so I mean, like, that's like kind of a, yeah, that's kind of like a new age term. I don't mean it like in any specific way, but it was just seen matter-of-fact that the human race is going through a huge change, and this is a very exciting time but also a very challenging, potentially, time because of the amount of—so the collective consciousness of humanity has momentum to it. It has density. It's like a—like thoughts are things in the higher realms, so there's a huge amount of history that the human race has built up that's based around fear-based intention and fear-based ideas and beliefs—all the ego expressions of fear that we have kind of enshrined into our cultures and lifestyle.  <br>So, you know, we have a lot of that momentum that's in there, and part of awakening has to do with rising our vibration in that we face that all momentum, we process it, we integrate it, and we allow ourselves to move closer and closer to our true nature, which is a true nature of love.  <br>So, anyway, so I won't—I don't know if I can guess what percentage have less experience. I don't like to refer to souls as new souls just because Earthly experience—yeah, maybe new, yeah, absolutely. Because, like, that's what I was going to say is the Earth experience is just one type of experience, and in fact, our entire universe is just one. The context from which we come is huge, mind-bogglingly huge, and the Earth is just one tiny little corner of our universe, but a very precious and high-potential little corner.  <br>So much so that being given the opportunity to play a human is like a huge gift. It's like winning the lottery. I mean, that's kind of like the feeling, but it's like winning the lottery in a sense of feeling honored, actually. Like, I felt honored that I was being given the opportunity to play a human life in part because it meant that I—and I completely agree, I don't want to make this sound like a hierarchy or better or anything like that. It's not like that. That's a challenge. Yeah, it's hard to say it without making it sound like that, but yeah, but it meant that, like, okay, the guides, like in spirit, see potential.  <br>Like, it's seen that I—that there is actually potential for me through this experience. You know, I mean, like, because the system is very efficient, and so if you're allocated the opportunity to play a human life, it is an incredible gift, and it means that it's kind of anticipated that there may be a very fruitful potential for you and for others. You know, if you have that experience, and that's true for all of us. You know, we evolve. Like, it takes a certain level of skill, you could say, to even play a human.  <br>You know what I mean? Like, not everybody—you don't go straight into college, you could say. You know, you just don't. It's not going to be beneficial. It's not at all, but there may be those who have less experience in college or more or—I don't know. This metaphor has limits, but yeah, anyway, I think you understand what I'm trying to communicate is that, yes, there is difference in level of experience within the souls that have come to Earth, and I do think it's probable that a large percentage of the Earth has yet to awaken to who we really are. But I think that's changing. I think it's definitely changing.  <br>Can you go back and talk about the being that you encountered because this is always fascinated me? It seems unusual, for my human perspective since I'm here and all of us are here, to even imagine that you could be traveling through the vastness of what exists outside of this place, and you would come upon a being that had this quality of being—had encountered physical lives, but that you hadn't encountered that before on a soul level. So does that speak to like a rarity of the fact that few people, few souls, have these incarnations?  <br>I don't know. That may be an implication. I can't draw direct inference there, but I do know that there was a moment at this point. I would even again not to use dualistic spectrums. I think we've disclaimed that enough, but I felt I was young. I was a young soul at that point at that time. I did not have the level of experience, and this being though he did.  <br>You know, and I was with a large group of beings in what I could describe as like a landscape of light, living light, and we were all moving together across this light. Some people have made fun of this word, but I like the word frolicking—just bounding forward and expressing joy and exploring joy and creativity in a new way. And we were going to do something. I don't remember exactly what, but I remember there being many, many other beings, and this being—I remember he caught my attention because the quality of his vibration, his energy, his sound even, you could say, was unmistakable.  <br>You know, it was like a brilliant golden light. I don't know how else to put it. So, I don't—I won't draw any inferences too much from that because then we're in linear time right now, so for us, and we're also in a place of discrete locations, so we like to separate things. That's how we understand things generally. Difficult to do because our higher nature is very unified. All time is within the one now.  <br>You know, so it's difficult to really draw too many inferences, but yeah, I don't know if I answered your question, but that was so inspiring there. It was a moment. I mean, it was one of those moments of like, I set a soul intention. Like, I as a spiritual being was like, "I am gonna do that." And, you know, what's funny is because I've shared the story a number of times, and it was only after I shared it that I came across a Bob Monroe video a few years later where I heard Bob Monroe—he's an out-of-body explorer who wrote a number of out-of-body books and founded the Monroe Institute—and I heard a video where he said most of us who come come because we become inspired by a being who has come, and we see the potential expansion of being that is possible by coming.  <br>And when I heard that, I was like, "Oh my gosh, like, I've never heard anybody say that like that, but that's exactly what I experienced." Like, I was deeply inspired to do this.  <br>Yeah, so then you talked about having—I'm going to call it a blueprint, and a blueprint may even simplify it, but I think that elicits a thought of what something could potentially look like. But you said it was a living, breathing energy of millions of different choices that you could make, limited by free choice, but you likened it to a tree. So let's talk about the tree.  <br>So the tree starts in a trunk, and then it has a couple of main branches. So are you alluding to kind of how I believe is that you have certain things that you set aside for yourself that you are going to learn—that you want to experience and learn again? I hate to use that word, yeah, the word learn. Yeah, more experience is I think a better word to use, but certain things that you've come here you want to experience on this human plane.  <br>And so the trunk starts at these two or three branches, and are those much more likely to happen or almost like set into motion so that you can then experience some of the things that go into smaller branches and then into twigs and then into leaves? And does that also mean then that we have contracts with certain people because I believe that you can only truly learn about yourself through your experiences with others?  <br>If you are on a deserted island, you might learn that you were resourceful and you could survive, but you wouldn't learn a lot about yourself. It's through your interactions with other people that really help you learn and grow. So in order to do that, you almost have to contract with certain people that, "This person, if they come into my life, is going to help me elicit this experience, and this person—they all have free will, so that's why it may or may not happen—but do you believe that we have certain people that we are contracted with, that it's almost like we couldn't help but meet them?"  <br>Yes, so we do make pre-arrangements for the context. In my case, my intention for this life was not specific to a given individual because of the specificity of the vibration I have. I'm attempting to integrate. Like, I know even now it's a living activity for me that I'm doing.  <br>So, for but for like in my case, I knew that the parents would be very important because I knew that, for instance, my father would instill a certain confidence in me, and that I needed that confidence in order to have a rock to stand on when the fear rose. You know what I mean? And I knew that my mother would be very loving, and that basically, I would be loved, and that was like if I was going to go do this and meet this certain fear, like that had to not be a problem. Do you know what I mean?  <br><br><br>But to your question, I do feel that yes, we do make plans. We do make sometimes what we call soul contracts with others depending on what we want to experience. I'm also careful about the word learn because learn implies an intellectual process. Yeah, I like to say we're not here for intellectual learning, though that's a part of it. We're here for a learning of the being by being something, by experiencing something.  <br>And so that pre-arrangement is like a context pre-arrangement, and you can arrange certain things in it. Like, I asked certain questions, for instance, I asked, "Can I be intelligent again?" because I knew that I had been intelligent in several immediately preceding lives, and I wanted to retain that quality. I was like, "I don't want to do a non-intelligent thing. I'm not doing that. Can I be intelligent?" No, it wasn't like a goic thing though. It was just like, "I don't prefer that. It was just I don't prefer that. I prefer to be enabled in that way." I mean, that's the best way I can put it, and they said, "Yes, you can do that."  <br>So I feel like that was worked in, but the main intention of facing this fear was intrinsically tied to a biological limitation that this body has that other bodies don't. And I actually knew that this body is an experience that other beings would probably pass up, just because there was like a certain biological something missing that would make day-to-day experience difficult.  <br>And that was important. This sounds, you know, like to the human vantage point, we get up—why don't we do that? We get up in our ego, and it's quick to defy and proclaim a righteous judgment, but in any case, I knew that from that perspective, that this limitation would basically—I don't want to—these words are bad, but keep me humble because basically, I knew that it would make it difficult day-to-day in a way that I really wouldn't be able to go down an ego path because I would be suffering a lot.  <br>Now, I know that that sounds like, you know, pain is good. That's not what I'm communicating—that pain is good. I'm just saying that from that perspective, I knew that this context had value, and that through that limitation that I would experience day-to-day, that would kind of support the likelihood, the probable very probable outcome, that I would be crushed and traumatized in my 20s.  <br>And the way that that physically actualized was I tried to move to China after college. I tried to move to Beijing because I studied in Beijing in college. I tried to go to a jungle city called Chengdu. It was 110 degrees. I had a heat stroke. I spent four days in the Chinese hospital, and they gave me bag after bag of potassium. And something about that interacted with my biology in a certain way that caused an absolutely agonizing, terrible, terrible neurological pain suffering that was just unrelenting and horrible, and I could not escape it. And it lasted for weeks and months.  <br>And it was just—I had post-traumatic stress after this experience for a number of years because it was so painful, and I locked it away. I couldn't even remember up until the age of 22 barely, you know, like my—because that's just what happens with trauma. Your psyche is too big. It can't handle that. It's too big. I'll put that away in a corner. We're not gonna deal with that.  <br>Well, through EMDR therapy and counseling and through a spiritual awakening, which actually happened as a result of this really, I think I went and I faced that. I found that fear, and that fear was not just originating in that hospital bed in Chengdu. It was from before. It was this deep, deep, low, low, low vibration—a staggeringly low vibration that in the past had bested me, and here I am now facing it even now as I talk about it, seeing it, feeling it. It's okay, you know?  <br>And I knew that the context, this limitation set, would enable that opportunity. It's not about suffering. It's not about signing up for suffering. It's about signing up for the context for an opportunity to have the opportunity. That's a huge distinction. It's an important distinction. You know, as people who are suffering so much and who reject so much of our lives, we—it's not like we're masochists.  <br>It's not like we come because we want pain. It's just that contrast is a very useful tool, and this is a high-contrast simulation and therefore a high-opportunity simulation. So the opportunity is to overcome the fear.  <br>Is that the biggest one of the biggest opportunities we have in taking on these roles and experiencing that duality of what we are, which is love, right? Yes, and so the opposite of that would be fear and lower vibration, right? Yes, so love is what we really are always. Everything that we are doing ultimately comes from love and returns to love. Everything, which is hard for people to understand because it seems like there is a lot of chaos in this world.  <br>And I liken the analogy that you bring about that—yeah, right—when I refer—I mentioned it before we started recording today—I referred to the Earth as like a kindergarten, and we're all a bunch of kindergartners running around with scissors. What I meant was that we—the quality—okay, it all boils down to the quality of our intent, our intention. That's a Tom Campbell term. He's a physicist and consciousness explorer. His work is really what helped kick me down this path to awaken, and he has this term that I adore—quality of intent—and it means what is the real why behind the choices you're making.  <br>What is the quality of being that you're bringing into your life choices and into your context? Is it love or is it fear? So, that's what I mean by fear when I use the word fear. I don't just mean the emotion of being afraid, though that is of course one of the chief ways it expresses. I mean that which we reject, that which we yet have to come to terms with, that which we have to integrate.  <br>When we come into an experience of limitation like this, what happens is we buy into perceptions that are not in alignment with the truth of who we are. So, like, some big, big ones are we buy into the perception of powerlessness—"I have no power"—or victimhood—"I am a victim"—or "I am unworthy of love." That is a huge one. So many people in this world think they've got to do things. They've got to earn the money. They've got to prove themselves. They've got to do all that they've got to do so that they can create a resume to themselves to explain to them so the ego can say, "Look, you have value because look, you have money," or "Look, you have value because you went to this Ivy League school," whatever it is.  <br>That's all happening because we have value. That's right. The truth is our nature is already that we already have intrinsic value. It's just that the ego is trying darn hard to fix the problem and fill the hole. Like, we have this big gaping hole now. We came into the experience of separation. Oh my gosh, now there's a huge problem because now I don't feel connected anymore. I'm missing the thing that I'm looking for. So we could say we're searching for God all the time, and we try to fill that hole with everything we possibly can, and it doesn't work. And we try really hard, and the ego tries harder and harder.  <br>You know, so when I say we're running around like kindergartners with scissors, what I mean is we have a lot of fear. That's really what's happening, and fear is just another word for yet unevolvedness. It just means we're committed into a context of such extremity, such limitation, that we have not yet fully integrated this such that we can shine our love even here.  <br>Yeah, we are all, but you could say that the human race is a bit of an orgy of fear. You know, we're just constantly stimulating each other's fear with the news and consumerism and the ways that we pass down fear through our belief systems and all the rest.  <br>Yeah, sorry, no, no, no, I didn't mean to interrupt you, but this is a big thing. So I don't know about you personally, but I haven't watched the news in almost seven years. I don't consume it on the radio. I don't watch it on any type of TV. The only way that I hear about what's going on is when people tell me, and believe me, you have plenty of people in your life who will tell you.  <br>I'm curious as to what your stance is on that, and the reason I do it is because I feel like I can't control what is being fed to me, and it lowers my vibration. In order to stay at a higher vibration, I have to consume it in the only way that it makes sense, which is an emotionally charged—yeah, like, I have a similar experience. I have not watched the news in a concerted way since my awakening 12 years ago.  <br><br><br>The vibration is not helpful in general. Now, I am interested in facts. I'm interested in what's going on, so sometimes I will seek out information. Yep, right, because there's always an agenda behind that. Yeah, the quality of intent behind the news is important. You see, everything, the way, the reason, and the why that we're doing it is important.  <br>So, is the news trying to just get hits and stimulate you know, six o'clock evening news fear? That is not helpful. And part of the reason it's not helpful is we are each—we're each creative beings. Okay, this is really important. We are all powerful creative beings, and what we're focused on and the vibration that we're coming from is very important because we're like little antennas or something, and we're communicating to each other all the time.  <br>So, if you have like everybody focused on, you know, like let's take a kidnapping. It's terrible. One happens, and now five million people hear about it. So now the fear, the ultimately ego decision, egoic-based decision of one individual, has now been amplified to affect five million people when, in fact, there's so much good in the world that we don't focus on because we have so much good in the world.  <br>So, like, I had—in my family, we—my father had a second family, and I had a half-brother who was three years old, and he ended up passing from brain cancer. That's okay—2005 or 2006, I'm sorry, I don't know the date, but it was a while ago. I was 26 I think at the time. The amount of goodness that came out of the woodwork from thousands of people that we didn't even know was overwhelming. Wow, that's not what the news focuses on.  <br>No, and I'm not saying we should turn a blind eye to the negative that's happening. I'm not saying that. What I am saying though is that the quality with which we not only transmit to each other but receive and process information is very important.  <br>Okay, so that actually brings me to an amazing segue—something you brought up before that I wanted to come back to—and you talked about the power of our thoughts. I listened to lots of near-death experience videos, and I had one that I listened to recently, and she was a nurse, and she got into a situation where this woman that she was working with, she felt wasn't doing a good job, and so she didn't gossip about it or tell anybody else, but internally she had all these thoughts about this woman, and she was resentful that this woman wasn't pulling her weight, and she wasn't very nice, and didn't have a good bedside manner.  <br>And then she died and had a near-death experience, and she was shown that her thoughts were actually heaping on more negative energy to this woman and not—and to prove the point, she was shown the entire life that this woman had lived up until that moment, and she had been shown abuse that she had endured from many people in her life, and that she was choosing to try to get out of her situation by giving back and becoming a nurse, but she wasn't very good at it. But by this woman's thoughts heaping that on this other woman, it was causing a disservice.  <br>And I'm going to put it into a context that probably everybody can understand that I've thought about for a long time. I think about Oprah Winfrey trying to lose weight with billions of people saying to her in their minds or talking about her about that she's fat and that she can't keep it off, and I actually believe that there is probably some factor with her that has not allowed her to do what she wants to do because she is such a public figure and so many people have heaped on their thoughts that are very powerful.  <br>So those are just two things, and I'd like to know your thoughts about that.  <br><br><br>I agree 100%. Our thoughts are things. They have a mass in—you could say not physical mass obviously, but well, they can eventually have physical mass, but they are like—you could say that the realm of thought precedes the non-physical realms that are thought-responsive, precede the physical manifest realm, and every intention—actually, not just every thought—thoughts are like forms, thought forms, forms of the mind. They are like things. They're that form. They're that specific thought. That vibration that is that thought is what a thought is, but it came from somewhere deeper even.  <br>So, in the case of the example you said, you know, when we have fear, it's our own fear that gives rise to our own ego patterns where we think we can reclaim a little bit of power if we just identify that person as the enemy. You know, that person's doing a bad job. See, now I feel just a little bit—my ego is popping me up a little bit, a little bit better. It's not real power. There's no real power in that, but it came from fear.  <br>So, also, once again, I feel it boils down to that quality of intent. Whereas even in your own mind, there's not—how do I put it? Love is what we are, so it's not about like babysitting yourself in a negative way. It's just that when you know the peace and the love of being, there is only love for that person. That's the only way I can put it.  <br>So, when we catch ourselves though, like, okay, getting into that pattern, it can be helpful to be humble enough and brave enough to find our own fear. What fear do I have that's giving rise to those thoughts? This is a challenge for me. You know, I have a new work environment right now, and sometimes, you know, that happens. There's ego patterns that might get passed around.  <br>A lot of humans do this on a day-to-day basis. We don't even—a lot of people are unconscious with how what they're producing, how they're affecting others. Mm-hmm, and it can be difficult. It's like a soup of vibrations at a certain vibrational level, and now you have to respond to this soup, and how do you—you know, that and that, and it seems like, "Oh, I don't have much power." No, you do have power. One awakened person is very powerful, disproportionately powerful, actually, to not only stop the chain of that egoic crap that gets passed around through thoughts and through actions but actually to shine a light vibrationally because they may not visually see it or understand even at a conscious human personality level what's going on, but that vibration of acceptance and love has an impact. It shines a light.  <br>You don't even have to be around other people. Meeting your own fear in the quiet of your own house, loving your houseplant, enjoying the sunlight coming in your window, and letting go of the fear of this disease you just found out you have—yeah, wow, you are affecting the whole human race. You just don't see it. It's that powerful.  <br>Right, we are not without power. You know, it's one of those things like, you know, we—with the news, back to the news topic—you know, we think, "Oh, there's these big governments. They have all this power, and there's these big people. They have all this power, and ah, no, actually, no, actually, you have the power." Like, I don't just mean that in a facetious way. Like, you are a creative, powerful, immortal, multi-dimensional being, and so am I.  <br>Yeah, and when we can be that—and that just means living joy now, meet your own crap now, own your own crap, do your best to be your real self here now. You hear someone, you know, tell you something negative. How do you respond? You know, that there's a lot of power in that. I know it sounds small, but the small stuff is the big stuff. It's one of the essays in my book. I think it's so important. The small stuff is the big stuff.  <br>A lot of near-death experiences talk about how in their NDEs, they find out that these small little acts of kindness and love are what had the ripples. You know, like one NDE—and I feel bad every time because I don't remember the person's name—but they were a child, and they went to like a car stop, like a rest area, and their parents asked them to get some water from like a river in a bucket for their family, and this person filled this bucket of water, and they were walking back to the car, and there was like a dry tree out of the way, and all they did is go over and water this tree.  <br>It's too heavy. The bucket was too heavy. Yeah, because yeah, yes, he had some of the water out. Yes, yeah, and then he took the rest back, and that was one of the most celebrated accomplishments of his life. How—I think it was a him. I don't remember—seven years old. I've heard that one also.  <br>And so, we are so busy thinking about, "Oh, I gotta do these big huge things. I gotta, you know, I gotta change." You are changing the world when you act in kindness, even to yourself, even in this moment tonight, today. There's so much power in that. That's why when I say when you do something to someone else, you are actually doing it to yourself. Yes, because we are literally connected.  <br>And I think that comes down to certain things like, you know, one of the things that plague a lot of people is they feel like they're a victim, or they feel like people have done things that are wrong, and it's very difficult to forgive somebody else, but forgiveness is never about the other person. It actually releases yourself so that you can change your own vibration and have your own control back, not let somebody else—yeah, because when you're in judgment, an ego judgment, you're in bondage actually because you're still—it's still fear.  <br><br><br>Yes, judging someone else is freeing yourself, and it's the way of love. I mean, forgiving somebody else is the way of love, and it, you know, like, I hear a lot of people say, "Well, what about, you know, the judgment by God?" And I won't—I'm not gonna try to speak to God except to say that unconditional love is the nature of God, and with complete understanding, total understanding, total unconditional love, in that, how can there be anything but forgiveness?  <br>You know, it's like when we know the other person, we love them because they're a part of us too. Like, we're all individuated, but we're also one. Those two things are not right. They don't preclude each other. They're not mutually exclusive. You are you, the individual, you are also one with everyone else and everything else, and in higher states of being, you can feel that and know it.  <br>One quick example—yeah, I had an out-of-body experience a few years ago. So, at the time of this experience, I guess I had it about 12 years ago or 11 years ago. At the time of this experience, I was early in my awakening journey, and at the time, I was not a fan of my wife's ex-boyfriend.  <br><br><br>And I hadn't—but I had an experience because I was still stuck in an ego interpretation, which was so crude, but at the time, I had this experience where I had—I felt and saw in this out-of-body experience who he is and who my wife is and how their beings overlap in a really beautiful way and how my being overlaps with his in a really beautiful way. <br>Like, what they shared was this knowing about quality of creative expression that I couldn't even comprehend, whereas he and I shared what I can only call an ancient honor. Like, honor was deeply precious to both of us. Like, our true nature, who we really are as souls, honor is something that is, you know, really important. It sounds so paltry to put it that way, but I felt it in thought and knew it vibrationally. It was like an ocean of color and vibration.  <br>But I also experienced how this gentleman—he experienced almost no love in his life as a human. Like, such a small amount of love, and in fact, negativity that he was like if you took Plato and rolled over it with a car tire and made it super, super, super thin. That was what he was. That was how he experiences this reality, but he's still trying to create from that place.  <br>Hmm, and I had so much respect for him, and I called him the next day, and I said, "I know this sounds a bit strange. I'm pretty sure I saw your soul last night. Let me tell you what I experienced." And I just shared with him everything I experienced. What did he say? He said, "Well, if I had to share who I really am with somebody, that's about what I would say."  <br>And now, he's close to our family. He comes over, and to this day, I feel like kneeling to the guy. Like, I have—I cannot have another. How can there be any other response? And it seems so silly to me now that I looked back and thought, "Oh, I had some ego thing about this ex-boyfriend." No, love is—I think it would be like that with every person, right? If we—that's what I said—story—if we really knew everything that everybody had gone through in their life and all the experiences and emotions and the things that they told themselves and how they felt held back, I think we would probably never judge anybody anymore, and we would only feel empathy towards them and not hatred.  <br>Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. It is true. We—there is so much trauma on Earth. It's ridiculous. Yes, like, we're all traumatizing the crap out of each other to varying degrees.  <br>Okay, so I have a really—this is really—this is gonna get kind of deep here. So, we come here to have these experiences, but the only way we can have this dualistic experience is to have negative experiences from others happen to us where we have a chance to respond in whatever way our soul responds.  <br>So, is it possible that some of the souls who come here actually take on a very negative role? It's not who they really are, but it's like, let's say we're planning a life together, and I'm like, "Christian, as my close soul mate on the other side, will you please play this role with me and do these things?" And you're like, "No, I love you so much. I can't do that." And I'm like, "Please, please, I need you to do it." And you're like, "Oh, okay. I don't want to do it, but I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna come here, and I'm gonna do these horrible things to you so you can have this experience."  <br>Is there some of that going on also in addition to people just having free will and going crazy with their fear and off the rails?  <br><br><br>Okay, so we do sign up for roles. We do sign up to play roles for each other that, from a human perspective, might seem negative. However, I'm very careful about making that synonymous with agreeing to do harm. Okay, because our true nature is love. It's always love, and the ability to—okay, it's gonna go deep. No, it's okay. This is good.  <br>Our own harsh context is what potentially damages us such that we develop ego and respond in fear and hurt others. So, when you went—like, so, if let's say you go into a family where you are abused, and so then as an adult, your tendency will be to abuse someone else because you've been hurt. You don't—you haven't experienced that love. It's what you know. You're just conditioning. There's all these things going on.  <br>From the soul's perspective, the context is seen. So, it's seen, "Oh wow, that is—it's likely that I'm going to experience abuse, and wow," because you're picking. You see the context, and I know this is really hard for a lot of people because then the question that always comes up is, "Well, there's no way people would sign up to be, you know, starved to death in Africa kind of thing."  <br>Well, I do have—I just want to say one quick thing. All experience is highly valuable. It has potential in it, and it's because we know we can't be harmed. We can't truly be harmed. We know we cannot truly be harmed, but it's—this is really important though—it's not just like I said, we're not masochists. It's that we see that the intensity of contrast cannot be greater than we are.  <br>Say that again. Say that intensity—the intensity of contrast cannot be bigger than what we really are. I think that's so important, and so what that means is when we sign up for high, high contrast, we are—I don't want to be categorical because the soul is very complex and rich, and there's a lot that goes into it, but you could say we are thinking something to the effect of many times, "Can I shine love even into that? Can I heal that? Can I stop that chain of hurt?"  <br>You know, it's not like, "Oh, I'm gonna come in and abuse you." Well, there may be a context in which there's possibilities for that, but I feel that it's never a case of a soul saying, "I'm gonna come in and harm you." No, no, harm is not our nature, but it is in—there is value though in signing up for deep, rich, difficult, high-contrast contexts, including contexts in which we might end up potentially creating contrast with someone else—contrast that's valuable for them.  <br>You know, metaphorically, this—I really am not trying to belittle the absolute horror and terrible trauma that people experience in this life. Yeah, when I say any of these comments, yes, I'm not trying to belittle that. It's a little bit like, though, on the other hand, when you agree to sign up to play a role for somebody, it's a little bit like saying they're saying, "I want to lift a weight on a weight bench." A little bit like that. They want the counter-pressure because, through lifting the weight—that's just a metaphor—they get stronger in a certain way that is important to them.  <br><br><br>So, let's take a specific example. Someone who is a master of kindness—I recently had a 101 where I shared some space with this person, and I felt the spiritual quality of kindness that this person had that was over the top—like, master-level kindness. You don't think of kindness as a superpower, but it is. Okay, and I don't know—in this person, I won't speak specific to this person for, you know, privacy's sake, but let's say you're a master of kindness, and so, let's say maybe in order to better learn and understand kindness, you want to experience a lack of kindness to respond to.  <br>Or let's say that you will be kind, but you're going to do it in a context in which maybe you're limited in some way. Maybe you have a biological limitation, or maybe you're around people that are kind in one way but not in another way, and you need to understand that other way. Like, it could be anything. Like, our souls are so complex. We have so much history. We have so much experience. So, the specificity of what we come to learn might seem very strange to the human, and it might be that we come to be there for someone else in one simple way.  <br>You know, if theoretically, you could come to live a whole lifetime just to be someone's friend for five minutes, knowing that they're going to be in a very difficult space and they're going to need you in that time, and you would need three experiences to do that in order to be there. Maybe you've already had those experiences. Maybe there's some reason that you—I'm just saying that the role, the things that we come to do, might seem strange to the human.  <br>But so then people ask, "Well, how do I find that? You know, how do I find that in myself for my own life?" A very highly personal question. I can't categorically speak to it, but just one comment I'll make: Find the patterns in your life and find what you feel called to intuitively and what fears you seem to have repeated issue with because often it's the weak leg that we come to walk on.  <br>I find that very much my own case. I have certain strengths. I'm not here for those. I'm here to do the hard thing for me—to really become vulnerable and limited and face biological limitation and pain that I can't escape. And by the way, then when you do that, it releases. It goes, but you know, we can process our fears at which point the love and the joy that is native to who we are expands and does measure like—the integration of fear and the expansion of being is a blissful process ultimately. It's not about torment and punishment.  <br>Yeah, now I know you have a limited amount of time, so I want to ask you one more thing. Yeah, sure. So, you talked about the sun as a being—yeah, a magnificent being. Can we also assume that the Earth is a magnificent being? And if that's what you've been able—if you can remember any of that, can you explain a little bit of that to us because I think that the Earth is going through a process? I think we all see it, and I think a lot of us feel like we want to do something.  <br><br><br>Well, I'm aware that the Earth has a consciousness of its own, but I didn't experience that directly in my experience. I experienced the sun directly, which had its own awareness. It's very difficult to describe—depth of being that is indescribable and beautiful but very, very different than a human point of view. But anyway, it had also a real consciousness. All still souls—boy, I mean, you know, like, it depends on how you define soul.  <br>I want to be careful because of what the word soul means, but I can say that everything ultimately is of consciousness and is conscious, and there are definitely many different levels within that. And even our own individual souls have many aspects of the self. You know, like, it's all you. You're you. You're the you that feels like you to you, but that you that feels like you to you is not your name. It's not your body. It's not your story. It's not your pain. You have experienced other things. That's who you are.  <br>So, there's different portions of us though that feel like—like, there's, you could say, like a fractal pattern of sub-levels of being. Maybe something right—almost like the universe itself only brings a portion of itself into this incarnation because it's actually happening inside. Yes, the higher self. Yes, exactly. Only like a—you could say an allocation of the self incarnates. Our full self is already on the other side right now. Right? You're not—it's so hard to grasp onto that, but that was what I was shown in my out-of-body experience is that the portion of me that is here in this body right now is like a fingernail of my pinky compared to the vastness and the power of my soul.  <br>And since everything's happening at once, we could potentially be having multiple experiences in different time frames because that's an illusion. And migratory birds—as you experience your soul being one time—yes, so crazy. Okay, oh my gosh, this is like one last comment. So, like, the pinky—the pinky can draw upon the ring finger or the middle finger or the pointer finger. They're all one being. Absolutely. I'm just describing that because you're not just this. No, you are the other portions of yourself.  <br>I think Seth talks a lot about that actually—drawing upon other personalities within a soul. Kind of beautiful, but I'm just pointing that out because exploration of the soul through meditation, which actually starts as a move—I don't want to get too much depth because we're running out of time—but which starts as a move not towards the form of this life but towards just the beingness that you are. You don't have to go seek anything specific. Just know the life that you are. Know the living awareness that you are, and in that, not even because you're trying, you may discover a treasure trove of being of what you are.  <br>There's a great Rumi quote that I love that reminds me of: "You wander from room to room hunting for the diamond necklace that is already around your neck." Hmm, that depth of being that we are, that is a part of source, is here now. It's not in the other room. I mean, it will be when you go there. It's you. It's here right now. It's a beautiful thing.  <br>We talked about so much today—so many different concepts. For the people that are watching, if there's just one thing that you could make them hear loud and clear, yeah, what would it be?  <br><br><br>You are not your human story. You are a multi-dimensional being of love, and there is nothing to fear. There is nothing actually to fear. This is a big play, and you can use this play however you want. Like, it doesn't have to be like you're putting the meaning on it. You have the freedom to apply the meaning to your life, to your circumstances, to your sensory experience, to the context. You have that power, and it's not really what you are.  <br>Like, if we can have one moment of moving back towards that freedom of being, that is a huge step when it comes to a place that's this limited. If we can take a small step here, it's a huge step in consciousness space. So, please feel empowered, not overcome and limited. We are not just these limitations. We are the ones experiencing the limitations and seeing what we can do with them. So, what you choose to do with your limitations today—  <br>I love that, Christian. Thank you so much. It has been an honor to talk to you. I appreciate your time so much.  <br>Thank you. Thank you for having me on. I appreciate it.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2023/insights-on-life-purpose-from-pre-birth-and-nde-obe-experience.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2023/Insights on Life Purpose from Pre-Birth and NDE OBE Experience.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:05:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Life Before Birth with Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=1wd-XVNhIxU<br>20 JAN 2023<br><br><br>This is Robert Manning, host of Guys Guys TV, and this week my special guest is Christian Sundberg. We're going to talk about his pre-life memories. It all starts right here, right now, on Guys Guys TV. You can also catch me on KCAA Radio here in Southern California, and Guys Guys Radio, my worldwide podcast, and now on UK Health Radio all weekend long. Guys Guys TV, Guys Guys Radio, thanks for your support.<br>Guys Guys Radio, it's our interview portion of the show. We've got a very special return guest. He's a real guy's guy, and he's here to help the world, believe it or not, and he's doing a great job of it. I got to tell you, I really enjoy talking to him. I love his work. His name is Christian Sundberg. Let me tell you a little bit about him. When he was a young boy, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. That's right, before he was born, he remembers his existence in pretty good detail. <br>While that memory left him completely in his early life until his early adult life, it spontaneously returned about a dozen or so years ago when he started meditating and went through a personal awakening journey. He also began to have out-of-body experiences, and now he often speaks publicly as he seeks to remind everybody, or at least in a small part, about who we are beneath the human play that we are involved in each and every day.<br>Professionally, Christian has worked for 16 years plus as a project manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing projects. So he's just another guy's guy out there. He's doing the work, and he's got a message that's coming through him, and I'm so glad to be sharing that again. The name of his book is called A Walk in the Physical, which succinctly describes the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey. So welcome back to Guys Guys Radio, Christian Sundberg. Good to see you.<br>Christian Sundberg: Good to see you too, sir. Thank you so much.<br><br><br>Robert Manning: Well, we're going to plan to have like an organic discussion today based on our collective experience here on Earth. I think it would be helpful though to begin by providing some context for your story. <br>At the beginning of your book, A Walk in the Physical, you describe being inspired by a great being of light who had experienced human incarnations. This being also had some information about the benefits of experiencing painful experiences in this and many lifetimes as part of our spiritual growth. You express interest in this journey that you're on right now and recalled one painful death and other lifetimes leading to your current incarnation. <br>So writing this book to help people expand their consciousness of the bigger picture seems to be your journey. Tell us about what I just mentioned in terms of how this all began. Where were you when this light being came to you? Tell us about that transition and the journey between that, coming to Earth, having a kind of aborted, quote-unquote, incarnation, and then coming back again, choosing your parents, doing a life plan, and all of that stuff.<br>Christian Sundberg: Thank you, Robert. That's a very large question. First, let me just disclaim that. Okay, so we're going to use words because that's what we have on Earth, but our higher nature, our true nature, fully transcends the context of Earth and all the forms and symbols that we have to use here. Our language is based on the limitations of Earth, like linear time and discrete location. These things that we take for granted, our higher nature transcends that entirely. So it's very difficult to speak to any of this successfully, and I feel like as soon as we open our mouths and use language, we're just wrong. Like we're just immediately inaccurate. So I just have to disclaim that first.<br><br><br>Okay, so your question was, where was I? That was your initial question when I met this being of light. So first of all, as humans, we tend to think that reality is primarily comprised of places because that's how we experience Earth. We see an exterior world. It's got places in it. We go experience those places, interact with them, and then we share them with each other. And so we think that that's the primary thing. There are places in higher reality systems for sure, but the form of the context of Earth is not first. It's second to our spirit itself, our consciousness itself, which can know Earth or engage many other types of reality systems. And those reality systems can be very different.<br>So in the experience where I engage this being, I was traveling with a group of probably hundreds of other beings across what I would describe as a landscape of light. I don't exactly remember what we were going to do. We had some shared activity, but when I came across this being, I felt from him the quality of his nature, his essence, because in that reality system, in most other reality systems, our connectedness is felt and known. And so typically when we communicate with each other in those systems, it's not done with words like we do here on Earth. We don't have to throw symbols at each other, a very crude way of communicating. There, it's all telepathic, and you can feel the nature of the other person. This is very hard to explain or describe, but you can feel their nature, and you can share information instantaneously.<br>So I had felt from him this incredible power and freedom and joy, and I was just in awe. And so that was what sent me down this whole path. I asked him, "How did you become this? What could you possibly have done to become this, to reach this state?" And he shared with me that he had lived a physical life. He shared with me many things, but the chief among them was that he had lived a physical life where he had suffered a physical health condition, a pain that lasted with him for years. <br>And it's not in your question, you asked about the benefit of pain. It's not that pain is beneficial specifically. It's that the way that this being chose to relate to the experience and use the experience, and how he chose to, what state of being he chose, you can almost say, shined through this experience and allowed a refinement of who he really is that lasted past the end of that limitation. And that was very inspiring to me.<br>Robert Manning: So you were in between incarnations?<br>Christian Sundberg: I had never been physical yet at this point. Okay, so sequence is very difficult to speak to because on Earth we like clean, linear time. This is all happening within the one now. So even though this memory feels ridiculously ancient, like millions of years ago, it's also alive right now. I don't know how to describe that, but it's before any physical incarnation.<br>Robert Manning: Okay, so and concurrently to that, you've had, do you agree that everything's happening at the same time, if you will, that time is not a straight-line continuum? Did you have, could you recall other incarnations? If so, kind of how many before where we are right now, just putting a pin on the map? Because we hear you and I are talking right now, even though the whole world, the whole universe has occurred right now also. But let's talk about that separately and us being here right now. So in that context of kind of a continuum, if you will, how many incarnations have you had, Christian?<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so you're aware of, so I'm still very much veiled, so I only have limited visibility to it, but I had an experience where I became aware of hundreds of other lives that I lived. So I know that I've lived at least hundreds. I have specific memory from a handful of them. I remember being a woman in one life, as an example. And you know, at times I've been curious about that, but when I go and reach for that, I just get this gentle, "No, you don't need to know that now." And I respect that. I respect that I'm still veiled, so I only have limited sight to my previous physical experiences.<br>Robert Manning: Now, in your decision to be incarnated in this particular incarnation, you asked for the ability to have a little bit of a peek beyond the veil, if you will. Yeah, he has to have a small amount of memory this time. I said I didn't want to forget all the way. I just wanted a small amount of memory, and they said that I could do that, but that it would make this journey more difficult because the contrast between there and here is very stark. It's very extreme, and so there is a painful homesickness that can accompany having some of that awareness. So I'm very thankful that I only have that tiny glimmer because it's not easy.<br>Robert Manning: The process of incarnating into a 3D body from a very high vibration, is there a discomfort to doing that? And if so, what is that like?<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, discomfort's not a terrible word, I guess. The nature of spirit itself is extremely connected, powerful, full of love and joy and freedom. That is our true nature. And so vibrationally, the way that is experienced is being a very, very, very high vibration. Our native state is connected to all things and each other, and it's just an endless amount of joy and love and knowing. It's all-knowing. So imagine going from that place down, down, down vibrationally all the way down into the human experience. This is an extremely limited experience by contrast, just incredibly limited. It felt like an incredible plunge in vibration to go from that height all the way down into the human experience. <br>And the human experience felt like kind of like arriving to the vacuum of space, like coming to a place where there was just no heat, no air, but also extremely dense, like being shoved inside of a tuna can, something like that, by comparison. So is that uncomfortable? Oh yes, it's very shocking. Birth is the more difficult direction, not death. Death is a release back up and out and return to the native freedom. It's a wonderful release. The process of incarnating, however, is much more abrupt, and that's the more difficult direction to travel.<br>Robert Manning: So for all of us then, you were acutely aware of a lot of this, and some, most other people aren't as aware as to how this process works. Does everybody go through a similar process as you went through, Christian, without the awareness per se, the remembering, if you will, of being kind of squashed into a human body? And is it by choice? And does everybody line up and go through a checklist in terms of, "Here's what I have to learn in this lifetime, and here's some of the possibilities for me," even though that it's going to be an infinite number of possibilities because of free will when we get to Earth? Tell us about the setup and launching into the human body for all of us that are listening.<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, okay, so first of all, just a quick comment on your use of the words "into a human body." Of course, it feels like we're in a human body, but actually, it's more accurate to say that the human body is occurring within your consciousness, your spirit already. That's an important distinction because we get very convinced in the context, but the body is just sensations and thoughts and feelings occurring within the body of your awareness. And that body of awareness is the same body of awareness that you were before the physical and that you will be after. So that's just a subtle comment, but I think it's worth mentioning.<br>So I can't speak for what anybody else has experienced in their incarnative process. I don't know for anybody else, but I do feel that it is something that we all experience, that we all choose to come. The spirit itself is sovereign, you could say. There is no greater authority. It's a drop in the ocean of all, the ocean of source. So there is no greater authority than it. <br>So the only way that we can be apparently bound—we're not actually bounded, but apparently bound—into the physical experience is to surrender ourselves into it, to let avail, to really surrender ourselves to a veiling process. And we do that for the purposes that the physical experience offers, which can be unique for each person. Each individual's choice may be unique. <br>So I can't speak to anybody else, but I do feel strongly that we do all choose, at least at the deepest level, we all choose, and we do see the value of it, even though there is extreme limitation involved with accepting the human experience. It's a no joke. It's like extreme sports or something. Not everybody's going to sign up for extreme sports, but anyone who's listening today in the physical has signed up for extreme sports.<br>Robert Manning: Okay, my special guest on Guys Guys Radio, the author of A Walk in the Physical: Understanding the Human Experience Within the Larger Spiritual Context, Christian Sundberg. So glad you're here, Christian. So for the benefit of our listeners and for myself because I'm learning as we go also, you were given some choices. You were, I mentioned pain earlier, and I said there was a benefit, and I probably misspoke there, but it seems like we have to overcome or work through pain and also work through fear when we get to this side as part of our ascension process. Please help me articulate that better.<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, sure. So okay, fear is the key thing to focus on. Pain is just a result. Pain is one of the many. We suffer because of the meaning we apply to our lives because of fear. Fear is the root issue, but it's not a fundamental substance or something. And I'm not just talking about the emotion of being afraid. I'm talking about our root tendency to reject reality and to try to protect ourselves at the expense of others. And we all know the feeling of fear and all the things that fear can mean. And I'm speaking of all of that when I mentioned fear. But fear is just another word for yet unevolved in this. It just means we've engaged a context that we have not yet fully integrated.<br>So I'll give a very simple example that I mentioned in the book because I know this sounds like perhaps overly simple, but I do think it's a great metaphor. When my father in this life was a little boy, he was afraid of closets. At night, he would lay in his bed and look at his closet and imagine all the monsters in the closet. And it bothered him every night for weeks on end. Eventually, he was so sick of being afraid that he got up out of his bed, charged over to the closet, pushed his way through the clothes to the back of the wall, and sat down on the closet floor. And he waited for the monsters to eat him. And then no monsters ate him. So today, my father is no longer afraid of closets.<br>Now, I use that as a simple metaphor because the thing is, there was nothing to be afraid of. There were no monsters. And similarly, in our lives, I know there's a difference in scope. There's so much rigor available in the human experience, but when we push our way through the closet and actually go face our actual experience, our fear, when we actually feel what we feel and engage our reality fully and with openness and without rejection but with full feeling, full presence, it may feel at the moment like the monsters in the closet are going to devour us, but eventually, that fear vanishes because there was nothing ultimately to be afraid of.<br><br><br>So while we come into the physical to face fear, it's not that there's just this thing called fear that we have to overcome. It's that we have to yet integrate a certain level of contrast, a certain level of context. And human experience is just an opportunity for a very rigorous and potentially challenging level of context and contrast. That's the primary thing. It's kind of like if you lay down on a weight bench and begin to lift weights, why would you ever lay down on a weight bench and push 50 pounds over you? Why would you do that? <br>Why would you put yourself under that stress? Well, it allows you to become stronger. You're using the counter-pressure of the weights so that you can grow in a way. The physical is a lot like that. We're using the counter-pressure of circumstance, the counter-pressure of context and contrast, and the ability to assign our own meaning onto the context and then work with it and make choices. It's all about choice-making. That is the great value of the physical, that we have that context to work with and to grow through.<br>Robert Manning: So when you comment, you're developing a contract with your team before you come over to this side, what is the elasticity in that? Let me try to go a little further with that. You have certain things that you want to accomplish, you have certain things that could happen, and then there's an infinite amount of possibilities along the way. Can you, how much of that is your free will determines that once you're incarnated? And can you change your trajectory or your timeline along the way? Let's say you've contracted to X amount of experiences in life, and you go off and you actually start living a different life, and you pass your expiration date and keep going, and it becomes a different experience. Talk to us about how that works, Christian.<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so that's an important element of the physical actually, is that free will can enable novel outcomes. So when we evaluate the life beforehand, what we're signing up for is a context. In my case, I had a specific intention in mind. I wanted to meet and integrate a very low vibration fear that had been very difficult for me in a past experience. And so they brought me a life that was appropriate for that primary intention. And then I reviewed that life in great detail and asked for tweaks to the context. And I could see from that side. <br>I reviewed millions and millions of possibilities of how the life might unfold, and the variable is free will, my choice-making, and the choice-making of all the other players in the game. But it could still be seen. You could call it a probability tree. Maybe it was a probabilistic review. It was like very likely that certain paths would occur and then less likely that other paths would occur, and it became more difficult to predict the further out it went. Something like that. I don't know. There were more branches on the tree the further out that it went.<br>So, for example, I knew that it was likely in my early 20s that I would be crushed by a trauma, and I was very excited at that opportunity. And I knew that especially starting that moment onward, I would be engaging a vibrational distance in a certain way that I had never engaged before, that I would be going further out in the wilderness than I had ever gone. So your question was about the elasticity of that. <br>Once we're here, I mean, we always have free will. We come here, we signed up for the context. I'm going to have this body until this body passes. Like I can't, I can't, that's part of the context. And there are other parts of the context. There's all the rules of Earth, the rules of physics, linear time, discrete location, all those good things. But within that context, there is actually a lot more flexibility than it may appear on the surface because the physical is actually actualizing to us also in a way that is probability-based. It's not an objective, truly objective place like it appears. It's more like a probabilistic simulation that's just very dense.<br><br><br>And so once we're here, we do get to choose whatever we wish. We have free will, and if we end up choosing something different, going down a different path, okay, so be it. That is part of the game. But if we sign up for one specific outcome or one specific experience, it's just very likely that that experience will transpire, not only because the context supports it, but because there tend to be nudges throughout our lives, perhaps from even the non-physical or from our own higher self, that kind of keep us on that path to the thing that we signed up to experience.<br>Robert Manning: It's kind of a critical point because in one sense, people could look at it as, "Oh, I'm an actor in a play. It's already been set. The lines have been written. I just have to act it out," versus "God is experiencing itself through us, and our lives are creation. We are artists creating, and the creation we make is our lives." And I think it's a very important distinction, and I think it's more of the latter.<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Definitely the latter and not the former. Our lives are not pre-written. It's just that the system is very, very good at predicting outcome because it knows us really well. It knows you really well. It knows me really well. It knows all the rules. The server has all the data, so it can predict outcome. But it's still probabilistic because you may make a choice that is unanticipated, and that might affect someone else, and that might affect someone else, and that can have quite an effect in the physical. So we do always have free will, and it is a creative process, very much indeed.<br>Robert Manning: So therefore, we can kind of skip over potential exit points, if you will. Let's say you got sick, and you got cancer, and then you changed your habits, and you changed your diet, and you changed your lifestyle, and you got better, and you kept going instead of getting worse and passing. So we have the free will to be able to impact that, correct?<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, absolutely. Free will does impact the outcome, absolutely.<br>Robert Manning: Okay, now today's kids, a lot of people say there's indigo children and all of that. Why is there anything special about the children that are coming into Earth today?<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so I'm aware of the idea of indigo children and the waves of volunteers, and while I don't have specific memory of that, I do remember in my experience knowing that Earth was going through an awakening process, especially beginning around my early lifetime. And that awakening process was just seen. It was like the act of the play. Like that's the act. The play is in the act where we're going to awaken now. <br><br><br>We're going to try to do this. And because Earth is such a dense, low-vibration place, and because there's so much fear in the collective consciousness, that act of awakening and processing that much fear is quite a substantial undertaking. It's not simple. It's a major undertaking. And Earth was seen as the place to be. Earth is very exciting, very unique. Wow, Earth during the awakening is exciting.<br>But I can't speak to any kind of specifically about the children. I do feel that the children, intuitively, I feel the children that are coming in are, at least a good portion of them, higher vibration and have that awareness. Sometimes, like I was at Walmart the other day, sometimes I feel energies from people, and there was this baby in this cart. I don't know whose baby this was, but I passed, and I felt the energy of this being for a moment, and it was just a baby, and I was like, "Oh my gosh, that mom has no idea the powerful being that's sitting in her cart right now."<br>Robert Manning: Well, that's a very important point also because I think that we've been kind of trained to not appreciate that the powers that we have as people. What do you see, Christian, as part of that happening on Earth now? What's going on Earth now? Are we in a period of ascension? Is the ascension being pushed down by certain forces? Are we going from 3D to 5D? Is there a lot of battles going on behind the scenes in terms of what's going to happen with our planet, with humanity, etc.? Disclosure, all kinds of other stuff.<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, well, so like I said, I do know that the human race is going through an awakening, and that is a part of what we call the ascension process. It just means that we as individuals and as a collective and as a planet are evolving, and we are attempting an evolutionary process in a relatively short amount of time. I mean, like one human lifetime is a very short amount of time. So even if it's a few hundred years or something, that's a very short amount of time to try to process the breadth of vibrational content that we're talking about here.<br><br><br>Are there dark forces trying to keep it down? I don't know of that. I generally am pretty sensitive to duality-sounding stories because as humans, we see a world of conflict, and we see a world of enemies, and so we're very quick to take conflict and enemies and then apply those stories into the higher context. Oh, now the whole human experience is a big conflict, or there's great powers trying to keep the human race down. I don't know. I have no knowledge of that myself. <br>But I do know that the human race is awakening. If I had to point at one challenger, it would be our own fear. And each and every one of us is a part of that. It's our own fear. It's not like the fear of the person down the street or the politician you see on the news. It's your fear, how you enter, how you relate with your life and interact with those around you. That's the playing field, and we are each far more powerful in that than it may appear on the surface.<br>Robert Manning: Okay, my very special guest, Christian Sundberg. We're talking about life before life, if you will, and life now and all that. Chances do we, since you had a light being kind of communicate with you before you incarnated, what resources do we have as humans, consciousness working in the human form, if you will, in terms of angels, higher self, family, etc.?<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, okay, so I'm not quick to draw distinctions between the different buckets, you know, guides or physical friends that we know that are helping us non-physically or our higher selves. There are distinctions, of course, but what's important to know is that the help that is there for us is substantial. In fact, I feel that the number of non-physical friends involved is even higher than the number of players in the game. Like there's however many billion of us now on Earth, there's more than that involved from the non-physical that are attempting to assist and participate in a way that upholds the veracity of the simulation and maintains free will. <br><br><br>And we all have guides. I feel we each have guides that are personal and dedicated to us, and we also have guides that come and visit us during periods of life where we may be engaging a certain kind of vibration, a certain perspective or challenge that is difficult for us, but maybe a guide is very adept at that specific kind of vibration. They may temporarily come and visit us and nudge in some way.<br>The higher self, I think a lot of people, including myself, kind of get tripped up as to, "Okay, is this an oversoul? Is this the consciousness part of me that isn't incarnate? I'm like a speck as part of this higher self." I don't know. I struggle sometimes with, "How do I communicate with my higher self? Is it me? Is it separate from me? Is it part of me?" Help us out with that, Christian.<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, yeah, so it's tricky for us because we're in duality right now, and we are experiencing an extreme state of separation. So right now, it seems like you're just this human body, and there's no other bodies walking around, and you can't feel them. It's really isolated. But the human portion of the self is a very small subset of the total self. You might think of it like, this is a very crude metaphor, but like one folder on your hard drive. It's not that big compared to everything. It's an important folder, but it's not everything. But it's very important also to recognize that the higher self is not some other being. You're not some pawn in a chess game that your higher self is playing. <br><br><br>You are your higher self. The you that is making the decisions, the you that is engaging this context and deciding how to respond to it, the you that is listening right now and thinking and processing, is your higher self. That is the very value. Like basically, you are you. You're always you. But when the constraints of the human experience are released, you discover that that you is much more than the limited human subset that you thought was you. I mean, that's the nature of the veiling that we experience here. It's meant to allow us to so deeply immerse into the perspective of the human character and its limitations, but that's all just a big illusion. It's actually just you're still the larger you even as you operate through the human character.<br>Robert Manning: How does karma work, Christian? Is it a true balance there? I did this, now I have to do that to make up for it, or can we just keep moving as long as we learn?<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so karma, I feel, is an idea that's often misinterpreted on Earth as judgment or a great justice system. So karma is, I like to say, another word for just cause and effect. Okay, so you have at the foundation of all things the unconditional love of being, of source. And that unconditional love is also full of incredible wisdom. Okay, so within that's the substrate that's always true, no matter what you do, no matter what choices you make, no matter how terrible you are, unconditional love is offered. It's always there for us. It is the nature of being itself. Okay, but then subsequent to that, as we enter realities of manifest form, we are only, as a soul, so good in air quotes, at engaging a given form in a way that our true nature, our true loving nature, can shine through that form. Or only so evolved at engaging a certain form.<br>So karma is just a word that helps us describe the very natural cause and effect, but we could even say the divine laws of cause and effect that help us facilitate us to meet our own imperfection and to grow and heal past through it. So it's not that you have to do something. It's just that when you get to the other side and you see who you are, what it is is you see who you actually are. Like it's one thing to be not engaged in the game and to say, "Oh, I'm a very kind person." It's another thing to actually come down here when someone flicks you off on the street, and you've had a rough day, do you get angry in return? <br>And then if you do get angry, maybe you make a gesture back, and it makes their day worse. And later in your life review, you might look back and say, "I'm a very kind person," but then you see now you actually did that action. You are the person who did that action. And it's like that with all the actions of our lives, and not even the actions, even our thoughts and our intentions. Everything is, you could say, balanced. There's a perfect cause and effect balance within it all, and it basically is just meant to facilitate us to be able to see who we are and to grow through who we really are.<br>So like this fear that I'm here to process in this life, I had a past experience where that fear overtook me, and I was an egoic monster. I caused a lot of damage to other people, and from the other side, I could see, "Oh man, I have a lot of fear. I got to do something about this." It wasn't that there was some great authority saying, "You that now that you screwed up, you're going to have to do this thing." <br>No, I just, I can see who I am, and my goodness, I have a lot of fear, and I love everyone else in the game that I hurt. So I choose then to re-engage and in this life to go through a trauma in my 20s so that I could meet, I could experience great pain, and then that great fear again, so I'd have a chance. And it is a chance. It's a beautiful chance to not only re-experience it but to integrate it and overcome it and heal it. That's what karma ultimately is about. It's about choosing to have the opportunity to heal and integrate something that needs healing or integration.<br>Robert Manning: Another aspect of that, another key word is ego. How does ego play in this big cosmic soup, if you will, that we're going through?<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, ego is just a product of fear. They are quite synonymous. If there is ego taking place, it means there is a fear down there. And you may notice, if you just pay attention to your own behavior, and you notice when you feel angry or you feel your own ego rise up, and you want to justify yourself in some way, "Oh well, I'm not wrong because look, I did," you will find, if you look honestly, you will find a fear down there. It might be a very scary fear. It might be a fear that's so obvious you haven't looked at it your whole life, whatever. But that ego rises up because it's just a part of us that's trying to fix the problem. <br>See, now that we are in this experience of separation, the separation prompts a potentially huge amount of fear. And because so much fear is prompted, "Oh now we got to fix. No, I'm separate, and I don't have any power. How can I get power again? Oh, I'll just believe this thing that'll make me feel better," or "Oh, look, I feel valuable now because look, I'm in this important group, and that person is in that inferior group. Now that I've set up this belief inside myself, now I feel better." It's just a game. It's an illusion. It's not true satisfaction, but it's just what we do inside ourselves almost as an unconscious reaction to fear.<br>Robert Manning: Okay, Christian, so you got a little bit of a peek beyond the veil, and you came into this incarnation, if you will, aware of that, that you are going to have that experience. How's it going for you based on what you had kind of signed up for and where you are now?<br>Christian Sundberg: I bit off a large piece of the sandwich. I knew it would be difficult, and it has been very difficult, but I feel that I am integrating experience that is valuable for me to integrate and that is meaningful. I'll just put it that way.<br>Robert Manning: But beyond your personal experience, it's coming into this world knowing what you knew coming in and seeing the dysfunction and the collective misbeliefs, if you will, has that been difficult for you to deal with? Like, "I can't believe what a mess this place is when it has so much potential."<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, do you mean from the human perspective, seeing the mess now that I'm here, or do you mean in the pre-birth experience?<br>Robert Manning: Here now.<br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, you know, there have certainly been moments that I feel daunted because the world is quite largely asleep right now. It's just that most people are not really aware of what we are, and our society reflects a whole lot of layers of fear patterns and ego patterns, all the us-versus-them thinking, all the distractions. It's kind of a huge fear orgy or something. And I do wish for more for mankind, but we are growing. It's definitely not a situation of hopelessness. A lot of people are quick to point at the world and say, "Oh, see how terrible it is." I don't see that. I see a play with many very brave beings who are undertaking a very challenging constraint set and doing their best to grow through it.<br>Robert Manning: No, that's a great point, something we should all keep in mind. What is the best advice you can give our audience out there in terms of how to deal with the reality that we're living in and the collective beliefs and kind of dysfunction that you've seen and that a lot of us who are waking up are experiencing? Because there seems to be, in my opinion, a bifurcation in terms of some people are going to the left, and some are going to the right, and I don't mean politically. <br>I mean, some people are asleep, and they have chosen and are choosing on a regular basis to stay asleep, and there are other people who are saying they're waking up and waking up faster and faster. And I don't know how those two, is it going to be different timelines? Is it a dimensional thing? How do, what's your advice for people who are on a trying to follow a good path and really ascend and do the right thing when you have such a dysfunctional place that we're playing in?<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so I would first comment that I don't think we should start the approach to this or the idea with the idea that we're in a dysfunctional place. Even that is putting a meaning onto it. The only thing that we have, and I know this is much bigger than it sounds, but it actually helps us cope. <br><br><br>The only thing we have to deal with is our own lives. And our own lives means our own relationship to this moment. That's it. So the only thing we have to worry about is the quality of our own intention. And we don't have to worry about it. We just, it helps us to be attentive to this, to notice the quality of our own intention in all of our choice-making in our lives. So what I mean is, are we wielding an intention that is based in love or fear? <br>And are we then making choices that are love-based, or is there some ego pattern and fear that is really at the root of this decision? That's it. That's it. We don't need to worry about these ideas in our mind of, "Oh, this event is occurring over in this corner of the world, and that's terrible," or "This idea of someone said something to me, and they think I'm a such-and-such person." No, only need to notice how we are responding to reality and work on that and work to move in love rather than fear in our own moments.<br>I know that sounds like maybe avoidance or something in a certain way, but it's really not. That is the active ingredient. The physical stuff all happens subsequent to that. If you meet your own fear, you are actually shining a light to the entire collective consciousness. <br><br><br>Actually, we all see and hear and feel that with each other when we meet our own fear, and that does heal the circumstances outside. So you're not powerless, even if you're locked in your room and you can't leave. If you meet your own fear and you choose joy and peace now in whatever small way, you are a part of the solution. That's a very empowering message.<br>Robert Manning: I agree 100%. If you want to change the world, you got to change yourself. And one of the ways you kind of reached a tipping point is through meditation. Talk to us about your beliefs about meditation, how you do it, how long you've been doing it, how did you start doing it, the type of meditations you do, etc.<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, sure. So I very much recommend meditation. I'll just start off by saying that. It's far more valuable than it appears on the surface. It's kind of like you may do it for a while and not even recognize, and then all of a sudden, there's a great treasure that you haven't even known was there always. So as for the type of meditation, so 12 years ago or so, I started meditating because Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer whose work I was reading, recommended it. He said, "Just go find out. Go investigate your own consciousness in an objective way. Don't make up any stories. This is not a new belief system thing. Just go look at your own consciousness, what you are when not engaged in thinking."<br>And at first, I started with a meditation exercise he recommends. I think it's in chapter 23 of his book, and it's synonymous with a transcendental meditation exercise and focusing on a neutral object. And after a couple of sessions of doing that, first I just felt some relief because I was constantly lost in stressful thinking. So I continued to do it because it was relieving and also because Tom said, "Attempt it for three months every day without any expectation of result." <br>Well, I did that, and after about six weeks or maybe eight weeks, I'm not sure exactly, but I had my first non-physical experience spontaneously at night. And it was so eye-opening that I was like, "There is something actually going on here. I've got to continue down this path to investigate." And then the pre-birth memory just kind of returned later. It was just, once I was in that state of awareness, it was just there. It wasn't like a big epiphany or something amazing. So I very much recommend meditation.<br>Robert Manning: Okay, last question. Have you met, Christian, other people who have had this similar experience that you've had in terms of being aware of what happened to them before being incarnated? The reason one of the reasons I asked you is you have a very big following, and I guess they're resonating not just with your message of unconditional love but also with the process that has brought you right here, right now.<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, well, I've met probably at least 40 or so other people who have pre-birth memory. And I even had one person reach out to me and say, "So there's a portion of my story that I shared about practicing surrendering to the veil in what I call the veil acceptance simulator." Just a, I don't know what to call it, but after I described this, I had a woman reach out to me and say, "I remember that exact place, and it's exactly like you described." <br>And she said that she pulled over to the side of the road because she's noted her whole life, and she never heard anybody say it. You know, those kind of validating comments are very interesting to me. But what's more important is that we are opening the door a crack and saying it's okay to actually consider the possibility of this because as we do that, there's a vibrational change happening right now. And as we participate in that and our vibration raises, it's going to be natural for us to have interaction with the higher, deeper portions of our self. And that's happening for many people all over the world.<br><br><br>So many people don't feel open to talk about it. A lot of people reach out to me, and they just want to share their experience, and I'm happy to hear because a lot of people do have similar experiences, and they are real. Like if you have an out-of-body experience, and it's a fully lucid OBE, there is no doubt. It's not like, "Oh, this is a dream or something." I mean, it's so real. It's at least as lucid and real as a waking Earth experience. <br>And when you come back from that, how do you not take that into consideration? I mean, like, you, it has to impact you. And many people experience that too. And now we're all kind of coming together, and I love that the dialogue is becoming more open. That is a wonderful, beautiful thing. I just can't live in secrecy of it. I have to share this kind of thing because it's so important to who we are. The real nature of who we are is beyond all fear. We have nothing to fear, and fear is the primary issue we're dealing with. So why not go around and remind each other? <br>I don't want to be that strange guy on the street who walks up to somebody and tells them they're a multi-dimensional being having a human experience, but if I feel nudged, I just might because we are here to remind each other of who we really are. It's very empowering when we remember, at least in small part, who we really are. And by the way, that memory is not exclusive to me or anybody else. It's just what we are. <br><br><br>We are immortal spirit. We are multi-dimensional consciousness. We really are, and you are too. And it's your birthright to know and experience the joy and the love and the freedom of that true being. That's who we are. We are love and joy and freedom. That is our true nature.<br>Robert Manning: Right, so I got off on a bit of a tangent there, but I'm just very passionate about that.<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, that's why I wanted to have you here because I'm equally as passionate about getting your message out there because I think it's an important one. And we should love one another, and we should choose love over choosing fear, which is something that we face, each one of us faces it numerous times every day.<br>Robert Manning: Absolutely. So absolutely, Christian Sundberg, I'm so glad we got connected. I'm so glad you came back on the show. I hope we reach so many people with your message. Keep doing the work you're doing. Tell everybody out there where they could find out more about you. The name of the book again is A Walk in the Physical: Understanding the Human Experience Within the Larger Spiritual Context. It's a great book. You don't have to read it from page one to 300. You can jump around, and it's got a lot of good stuff there. I won't go into all of it, but check it out. Tell us where your website is, Christian.<br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, sure. My website is awalkinthephysical.com, so <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://www.awalkinthephysical.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://www.awalkinthephysical.com." target="_blank">www.awalkinthephysical.com.</a> The book is available for free on that website. It's the third link down on the book page. It's not about money. I just would like to get the information out there. The book is also available on Amazon and Audible, and I'm happy to try to interact by email to anybody who'd like to reach out, but I do sometimes get swamped, so I apologize if I don't respond.<br>Robert Manning: Yeah, well, great to see you again, Christian.

 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=nujzYZyyeDk<br>6 OCT 2023<br><br><br>But whatever it is that we're afraid of, we're afraid of it because we're buying into some perception that is not in alignment with the truth. And so, the way to really process it and integrate it is not to run away from it, not to force a new meaning on it, but to go towards it—to actually go into it and find: What do I feel? What is actually buried down there? What negative perception? Okay, and here's one thing: When you find that negative perception, it will feel so obvious that the world and your life has proven to you that it's true.<br>Have you ever contemplated the true nature of fear, death, and the vast dimensions of our existence? In this thought-provoking interview, Christian Sundberg dismantles misconceptions surrounding fear, guiding us towards the realization that there is nothing to fear—not even death itself. He challenges us to shed our earthly associations, explore our multi-dimensional nature, and embrace love as the most potent force in our lives. Christian's non-linear model of reality, presented in his book A Walk in the Physical: Understanding the Human Experience Within the Largest Spiritual Context, encourages us to shift our focus from the physical to the realm of consciousness—from personal transformation to its ripple effects on collective consciousness. <br>This interview offers a compelling perspective on how our choices can shape a more conscious and loving world. It's now time to tune into this one very inspirational human being. Enjoy!<br>Well, good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, depending on which side of the globe you are sitting on right this very moment. We have the most amazing guest for you today: Christian Sundberg. Welcome to the show!<br>Thank you so much. I'm happy to be here.<br>Oh, I am so excited, especially about some of the topics that we are going to unpack. So, the way that we love to start the show, Christian, is we always love to ask our guests: How did you get to where you are today? What inspired you to do what you do today?<br><br><br>Yeah, thank you for asking. So, these things are very hard to talk about in language on Earth because, you know, our language is based in our local world of form and its assumptions. But I can say very simply that about 13 years ago, I began to go through an awakening process, and I had pre-birth memory returned to me. So, for most of my life, I did not have this memory. <br>I did as a small child, and then it left me by the age of five or six. My body is 43 right now, and at the age of 30, when I took up a meditation practice, after a few months, I began to have non-physical experiences—out-of-body experiences—and I also had this pre-birth awareness return to me. And so, I just really feel called to share, to remind each other what we really are underneath this human play that we're playing right now. You know, because our true nature is one of love and joy and freedom, and there's nothing to fear. I just—I'm really passionate about that message.<br>So, when you're talking about pre-birth memories, what are those memories? What do you remember?<br>Sure. So, I will do my best to share, but like I said, this very much transcends the limitations of language because our language is based on the assumptions of our local world—assumptions, for instance, like linear time and discrete location. You know, these are things we take for granted here that are not fundamentally real. So, it's very difficult to put these things into language, but I'll do what I can.<br>Okay, so I remember a long time ago—and I say a long time ago, this feels like millions of years ago, but it also feels like right now, like it's happening now—coming across a being who had been physical. <br>This is before I had any physical experiences, and feeling from this being what he is—what he was—this incredible power and joy and freedom that was a part of the essence of this being. You know, because in those higher systems, we can know our connectedness with each other and with the environment. <br>Our connectedness is just known and felt. So, I could feel from this being this incredible power and depth and joy, and I asked him telepathically, "How did—my goodness—what did you do? How could you possibly be this? What did you—how could you have arrived at this state of being?"<br>And he shared with me—well, he shared with me many things, but chief among them was that he had lived a physical life, and in this certain physical life, he had experienced a chronic health condition—a pain that lingered and lasted with him for a long time, some years. <br>And the quality with which he chose to meet that pain allowed a certain refinement of his being—this profound expansion and this depth of knowing. And I could feel the incredible power and the joy that was within him, and that he knew. And I was like, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I'm going to do that." I was just so inspired.<br>And at first, he kind of—this isn't negative—it was kind of like he brushed me off almost in a playful way, like, "Yeah, you just don't understand. You just can't understand how difficult this can be potentially." And I was persistent. I said, "No, I want to do this." And he said, "Okay, well then, go talk to your guides."<br>So, I don't remember right after that, but I remember living many times and then coming back and finding this being later and sharing with him that I was on the path—like, I hadn't reached that full point yet, but I was sharing with him that I was on the journey, and he was very encouraging.<br>So, then the majority of my pre-birth memories are of a time immediately preceding this life—or somewhat immediately preceding this life—where I had taken a long break in between physical experiences. And I remember this guide coming to me over and over and asking me, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And putting him off for a while, and then eventually saying, "Okay, I'm ready." Like, he was just reminding me of my own intention and saying, "Okay, I'm ready now."<br>And then reviewing with this guide what I can only describe as my state—like, who I am and who I've been and what I was. And it was like reviewing a—the words are so lacking here, but it's like if you took a graph or something and reviewed all these different virtues, maybe, or qualities of being or types of experience—vibrations. You know, I could see what I had done and what I understood, what I knew, what I was—the qualities that I really knew. But I could see this one area that was like super obvious, like, "Oh man, I got to do something about that." Like, it was not hard to detect. And it was this one very extremely low-vibration fear that I had experienced in a previous life.<br><br><br>And then, in that previous life, this fear had bested me. It had overcome me, and because of that, in that life, I had become quite an egoic monster, and I had caused a lot of damage for other people. And I could see the incredible depth of this fear, but I also knew the—oh my goodness—the profound opportunity for expansion if I could really meet this fear experience all the way and deeply integrate it. I knew the profound expansion of being that would be possible—not only for me but for the whole. But even from that perspective, I could see and feel like, "Oh my gosh, that is a really low-vibration fear in a very specific way."<br>And I asked the guide, "Has this ever been done in all of creation? Has any being ever engaged a fear of this low vibration in this specific way?" And he shared, "Yes, and you have all of time available to you to do so. There's no hurry." And I just knew—and I know this sounds strange to me now as a human, you know, because I've suffered like so many of us here—but from that perspective, I just knew, "If it can be done, I will do it." I was super excited to do so.<br>And so, they brought me a lifetime that was very appropriate for that intention of meeting that fear. And that lifetime was not this lifetime; it was a lifetime just before this one. And I remember reviewing that life in detail and then accepting that life. And then I remember accepting the veil. <br>Okay, so this is really hard to describe, but this is like in the forefront of this experience for me: this plummet in vibration—down, down, down, down, down—from the state of connectedness and knowing and having full access to all that is and knowing myself as all that is. And having just this—each soul is such a breath and a depth to it. I felt this plummet of vibration as I accepted the veil into this previous physical life—down, lower, lower, lower, lower—and having all my knowing be cut off and all my memory disappear and all that I was felt like it was erased.<br>And I arrived to this very dense, cold, empty place of being in the womb. And I was only there for a very short time, and then I was like, "You know what? I am not doing this. There is no freaking way I am going to tolerate this low vibration." And I had all this fear rise up because I'm like, "No, this is not happening. There's no way. I can't even tolerate this for seconds, let alone a whole lifetime. I'm not doing that." So, I summoned my might, and I smoked the veil. I fought my way out past it, and I was successful in doing that. But I immediately recognized that I had killed the body—I had killed the fetus that was to be mine.<br>And I had a life review, just like near-death experiencers describe. I could see within moments all the ripples in the branches and how my fear had affected not only the poor mother because I had heaped grief upon her, but hundreds of other people who would be negatively impacted by the mother because of my fear. And I—that was all because of my choice. And you know, from that point of view, I knew that it was—you know, it was okay. Like, all is as well, and it's just like a big play. But I also could see very objectively, like, "Wow, I have a lot of fear. I got to do something about this."<br>So, I spent some time then practicing surrendering to the veil in what I can only describe as like a veil acceptance simulator. I know this sounds wild, but I remember being in this place that was like being dunked into a dark pool and like being held underwater, and then you can cry uncle, and they'll let you out—kind of thing—to practice surrendering to a veiled experience. And I can tell you that the real thing is a lot more difficult than the simulator because you can't cry uncle for the real thing.<br>So, anyway, then they brought me this life, you know, because I still had this intention to process this fear. And this life was good, but it wasn't as appropriate as the first one would have been. The first one was like a really good match. I don't want to put numbers on it, but just to give a crude sense, you know, like the first one, if it was like 99% optimal, this life was like 86 or 87% optimal—something like that. You know, not literally that, but I'm just saying I could feel like, "Oh, it'll work. It's good enough."<br>And I remember reviewing what I can only describe as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of what might happen in this life as Christian. It was like if you took a tree and laid it over on its side and you started at the thick part and worked your way out to the branches. It was like feeling and seeing and knowing millions of potential outcomes, with some being very likely and some being much less likely. And there were events in it, but it was primarily about what it would be like to feel—you know, to have the actual experience of being Christian, being the human.<br>And I remember making certain requests, like for instance, I asked to be intelligent in this life. I know that's a quality that I had had in recent lives, and it was something I preferred. And they said, "Yes, you can do that." And I also knew that it was important that—like, my father—I knew my father and my mother and my grandparents would be important, but that my father, in particular, would help instill a confidence in me, and that I would have—that I would have that confidence as like a rock to stand on. So, when the fear came up later in life, I—it wouldn't be like self-worth wouldn't be the thing I was struggling with. I would have that to stand on to face and process the fear.<br>And I also remember asking, "Can I just not forget everything this time? Can I have like a tiny, tiny—just like the smallest amount of memory?" And they said, "Yes, you can do that, but it will make the journey more difficult." And I knew why. I could sense it was because the level of contrast between there and here would be even greater. You know, because if there's some awareness of that higher state of being, then being down here vibrationally speaking is such a stark difference. You know, the veil is actually protective in that way. It protects us from homesickness and from missing the richness of that state of being.<br>But I knew that even that contrast, though, was an opportunity for growth. Like, all contrast is actually an opportunity for expansion and growth. So, I accepted. And then I remember there having to be a moment to accept the life, and I don't remember that moment, but I do remember then being in a waiting area, and all of a sudden, this guide coming to me and getting my attention like, "Go now." Like, grabbing my shoulders, very abruptly, like, "Okay, Earth time, buddy," that kind of thing. And being like, "Okay, okay, now."<br>And then being in this room that I can only describe as like a technician's chamber or a mechanic shop. It's hard to articulate, and there were these beings there that are very technical in nature. I might refer to them in English as tinkerers—it's probably a good word descriptor. <br>And below me was this shaft, and the Earth was below. And they—I don't know how to describe this, but they do this thing where they tweak the veil to you because the soul—you, as a soul—are very, very unique and rich and have all this particular, powerful, unique quality to you. And then the life and the body and the context—it all has its own vibration. And they do this thing where they make it all jive—they make this organic fit for the veil so that it will be effective in a lifetime.<br>And I remember them asking me one last time, "Are you sure?" Like, it was like a last chance button. It was like getting on a roller coaster or something—you know, once you get in, you can't get out until the ride comes to a complete stop. And I remember saying, "Yeah, I'm ready." And then once again, feeling this plummet in vibration—down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. <br>I like to describe it like if you have a sound amplifier that produces a pitch, and then you turn the knob down, and then once you get to the bottom, you just turn it down some more and then crank it down more and then more, more, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. That was what it felt like in the body of my awareness to descend down, down, down, down, down vibrationally into this dense, dark, cold, empty place of being bodily in the womb. And having all of my knowing cut off and all of my connectedness disappear.<br>And this time, I just focused on not fighting it, you know, because I remembered the previous attempt. So, I basically just focused on surrendering to the veil and letting the veil do what it would do to me. And remaining in that state of focused surrender for a while, and then eventually, feeling in this very low-vibration state, sending one message back to the technicians: "Did it take?" And then them sending one message back: "Yes, it took." And I actually felt really accomplished at that moment because even just arriving to the physical is quite an accomplishment because it's such a vibrational distance.<br>So, then I was there for a while, and then after a while, I was like, "You know what? I am not doing this. There's no way." It was such low vibration, it was so dark. And once again, my fear began to rise up, and I began to summon my might to find my way out again. And as that happened, the most holy moment in my life happened. I felt myself expand back out, and I felt all the stars and all the galaxies of the universe within me. And I felt the bliss of our sun—like our sun has a consciousness to it, and it was churning with this raging bliss of being.<br>And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And that was like, "Oh my gosh." That was like, "Okay, I don't have to fight then." Because the fear was because I felt like I had lost everything that I am. And so, I was so—it was like this deep reassurance, and I'm like, "Oh, okay. I haven't lost all that I am. Okay." So, I stopped fighting, and I just surrendered into the simple existence of being in the womb. And I was there for a while—it felt like a very long time.<br><br><br>And then the next thing I remember is being born. I remember the shock, the cold, the light, and all the sense data. And I remember looking up at the nurses and being so intensely curious because I had no idea what was going on—no understanding at all of the context. And I remember feeling this incredible love for them, actually. I didn't know who they were or what they were, but I knew they were beings, and I was like, "Who are these beings who are taking care of me?" <br>And I was so curious. I remember looking at the world with such intense curiosity. And you know, it's funny because I described this to my father years later, and he said that when I was born, I had these wide eyes, and I was the most curious being he'd ever seen. He's like, "Who is this being who's so curious?" Like, I remember that intense curiosity of, "Where am I? What is this place?"<br>So, then I don't have many memories after that for a while, but as I began to grow—even as I was learning how to walk—I remember having access to these pre-birth memories and just checking into the flowchart memory casually, just to see what was going to happen—like, just to know if someone was going to come over to the house or what we were going to do tomorrow. And you know, that ability greatly diminished as I aged. You know, definitely by the age of five or six, my memory had completely left me. And of course, I had no pre-birth memory at all between the ages of six and 30.<br>So, anyway, that's a quick summary. It's very difficult to describe the experience. There's more to it that is difficult to describe as well. I'm trying to be succinct, and I know that people are interested in the story. But I think what's far more important is that we remind each other of what we really are. You know, because all of us have gone through something similar. <br>I mean, I can't speak for anybody except myself, but we are all multi-dimensional beings, and we have all come from these higher systems down into this incredible experience of denseness for the purposes of the expansion of love and joy. And there is nothing ultimately to fear. And I just think that's so important to remind each other of. And yeah, so that's what I like to do.<br>I love the way you described that, Christian. And I got a picture like when you were describing it, I had this—it's almost like a roadmap but with music notes, and you were able to look at it and go, "Oh, this is really interesting. What's this?" And you got to get really curious about the fear aspect and sharing your journey. <br>So, I'm just trying to understand because I—and I don't know this just from things that I've read and things that I understand—as a soul, do we get to choose what vibrational frequency we step into from a timeline perspective as a way to expand our consciousness? Or as a soul, do we keep coming back until we learn the lessons—whether that was the fear lesson—as a way to expand? Because I've heard two different aspects of the different paradigms and those high vibrational frequencies where we come in and make amends to make sure that those musical notes are in harmony.<br>Yeah, that's true. I feel like both the things you described are true. I don't see the contradiction. We do return by choice to continue to refine the music. If there is a note that is off, that's not a bad way to put it. Because as beings, we seek to expand and to grow and to balance out. And if there's like certain strengths I have that I'm not necessarily here to work on—I don't really like the word "work on" because that makes it sound like we're here to do a deed.<br>This is more about the expansion of being. And the learning we do here is not an intellectual learning; it's an experiential learning. It's actually learning by being something. It's the learning of the being (with a capital B) by being something (with a lowercase b).<br>So, in my case, I needed to—not needed to—I chose to be, for its value, the human who had been crushed by a health condition and felt completely powerless to it and completely unable to escape pain. And that sounds pretty terrible to the human ego, but the ego arises from fear and from rejection. <br>And from that higher state, we know that our true nature cannot be threatened. We cannot truly fail. There's no failure. We are life itself; we can't fail. And so, from that perspective, we wish to balance out and refine the qualities that we know and that we are forever. And that can be done in multiple experiences, or we might interject at some point into a given physical reality where there's an opportunity for us to do so. Some context might have specific value for us.<br>In fact, I feel that almost—for the vast majority of us—I feel that we've chosen our context very specifically. I think some beings just want to get in, and they'll take whatever experience they can get, kind of thing. But for most of us, we choose a life that is very specifically valuable for us in some way. And that may be difficult to see from the human point of view, of course. We accept being veiled; that's part of the game—that we don't remember. But from that perspective, we do see the value, and we do intentionally choose to come for some specific experiential purpose.<br>Yeah, I truly believe that. I always say that because quite often, people that I have spoken to—people that have sat in class with me—quite often talk about seeking their purpose and looking external of themselves. And I'm always saying, "But our sole purpose here is to expand and experience." <br>And then it's—you know, I think a lot of the times, the ego mind judges whether that was a good experience or a bad experience. And experience is experience, right? And so, the more that we can accept what is rather than judging it, we go through those experiences a lot faster. I've experienced that, anyway, from my experience—a lot faster.<br><br><br>Absolutely. Yeah, I just want to say something about that. So, our true nature—our true nature is love and joy and freedom. Like, that is the very fabric of being. The fabric of what is is love and joy and freedom, okay? But then we enter into a rigorous set of constraints here in the physical. Now, the rigorousness and the denseness of the constraints may be high, but it's neutral. We put the meaning onto it. And it is in buying into meaning that is not in alignment with the truth that we suffer—that we experience fear.<br>So, for example, if we buy into a perception of, "Oh my gosh, I'm powerless. I have no power," that really is converse to the truth, which is that you are incredibly powerful. You have total freedom. And so, but then we feel fear, you know, because now we're buying into a perception that is not in vibrational alignment. It's not actually the truth; it's an illusion—a falsehood, you could say. <br>But anyway, so what I'm saying is the rigors of the physical are neutral. And as they arise, if we fully accept them and fully meet them and fully allow them and fully integrate what we experience, the joy and the freedom of our being very naturally rises back up to the surface because it never left. The only thing that was apparently separating us from it is our own rejection, which means our own fear, which is synonymous with our own unevolved—just that we haven't grown up enough to say, "This is okay. I can actually be present with this experience, no matter what it is."<br>Now, I know there's huge levels of difficulty difference—like, there's a huge difference in the rigor and in the sense data. There are experiences that can be incredibly physically painful in this world. But even so, even that pain is neutral, and we put the meaning on it. And we get to decide how to work with it and what to do with it.<br>It's amazing. It is so true. I always say it's the meaning we give it that determines how we're going to experience it or how we respond to it or how we react to it. And I think that also, for me, it's one of the things that's taking me into my mid-50s to really get the understanding of acceptance. And even like what I do is I am practicing—and it's hard, Christian, I'm not going to lie—but the non-attachment, the non-resistance, the non-judgment—those kinds of things are a practice in itself in this physical form as a human being.<br>But even so, I find that a lot of the times, I have fear thoughts come to mind, and then you have to be conscious, which is hard because when you think about it, when we're on autopilot and we're functioning on a very unconscious or subconscious level, for us to be conscious, there needs to be a level of stillness and pause. And so, when I'm in that state, I can actually go, "Oh, I'm feeling fear. I'm experiencing fear. But is there truth to this fear? And what meaning have I attached to what I'm experiencing?"<br>So, what's your trick? Like, we're human, right? We all have it. Do you experience these things?<br>Yeah, yes. So, okay, that's a wonderful question because it's really at the heart of what we're doing here. So, this is an important topic. Okay, so first of all, I agree that finding that stillness is a very important step—a very important first step. Because it makes sense that it's in the stillness that the fear arises because what you're doing is you're letting go of the ego stories that are protecting you, keeping you separate from the fear that's actually down there. So, as soon as you have stillness and you let go, guess what? The fear will come up. But that's good; that's okay.<br>So, when the fear rises up, it's not a matter of saying, "Oh wow, I recognize I'm afraid, but I shouldn't be. I'm going to pile a new forced idea on top of that fear." That's not the real process. I'll use a metaphor for the process. Okay, so this is a simple, silly metaphor, but I think it helps. <br>When my father was a little boy, he was afraid of closets. And every night when he went to sleep, he thought there were monsters in his closet. And so, every night, he couldn't fall asleep because he was afraid of the monsters in his closet. And this happened for weeks and months, and he lost all sorts of sleep over the monsters in the closet.<br>And one day, he said, "You know what? Screw this. I'm going into that closet, and I'm going to find those monsters. And if they eat me, so be it. I'm sick of being afraid." So, he opened the closet, pushed his way through the clothes, and sat on the floor, completely terrified, expecting to be eaten by the monsters. And there were no monsters in the closet, and they did not eat him. And so, he realized, "Oh, there was never actually anything to be afraid of." And so, now, as an adult, my father is not afraid of closets.<br><br><br>Now, I know that sounds silly and simple to us as adults, but we as adults are not terribly dissimilar with our own fears. Now, the scope may be different; the scale may be different; the richness and the context might be different. But whatever it is that we're afraid of, we're afraid of it because we're buying into some perception that is not in alignment with the truth. And so, the way to really process it and integrate it is not to run away from it, not to force a new meaning on it, but to go towards it—to actually go into it and find: What do I feel? What is actually buried down there? What negative perception?<br>Okay, and here's one thing: When you find that negative perception, it will feel so obvious that the world and your life has proven to you that it's true. So, if you've bought deeply into a perception of shame—like, "I'm not worthy of love"—you might go in there and find, "I feel shameful." And the reasons for you feeling shameful may be multitudinous. Maybe you were treated a certain way as a child, and on and on and on—you have all this whole lifetime that proves to you that you are not worthy of love.<br>I recommend—I encourage that you would challenge even that because our deepest beliefs become invisible. We think it's a part of reality itself; it's actually our belief. And so, we can actually go into that and honestly approach that deep fear and say, "Wait a minute. I feel—wow, I feel shameful, and it hurts like hell." And then go into the actual feeling itself and allow ourselves to feel it.<br>So, when I say that, there's one key mechanism I want to point out here, and it's a mechanism that is at work in all things in the physical. And that is your intent—the quality of your intent. Like, this is not a process—what I'm describing is not a mechanical process. We're not here to go through step A, then step B, then step C, and now you're done at D. <br>We are here to wield an intention that is of high quality, which means love—loving, accepting, feeling, being willing to feel, being willing to be humbled, being willing to be vulnerable, being willing to be potentially crushed by all this negativity that we've buried deep within ourselves—rather than an intention based in fear and self-protection and rejection and ego and all the crazy ways that ego manifests.<br>When we are willing to put down the distraction of the ego and the crutch of the ego with whatever story we're telling ourselves to avoid what we're avoiding and actually go in and take full ownership for who we are and what we feel and honor ourselves enough to actually feel it—that heals it. That is going into the closet. It may hurt like crazy—like getting hit by a truck momentarily. <br>And you don't go into it so that you can get rid of it. Your intention is not even to get rid of it. Your intention is to actually feel it and love it and accept it and know it as a part of yourself. And you just do that, and then all of a sudden, the tornado dissipates—not because you tried to get rid of it, but because you brought the light of your awareness down into the basement and felt it. You actually allowed yourself to feel.<br>That's incredible work, you know, because after the physical life is over, that depth of experience that you just engaged—you get to keep forever. Where else can you do that other than here?<br>I'm smiling and nodding my head like this, Christian, because I've actually experienced this just recently myself. Where the practice of acceptance—and there were moments where I was feeling angry, and for no reason, just angry. And I was repressing that by saying, "I shouldn't be feeling angry. I've got everything. I'm so happy." But I was avoiding. And the moment I sat with the anger and accepted that I was angry, I could feel the stuff that was bubbling up. <br>And then I let go of the anger, and then it was like layers. And then I went into sadness, and then I felt really sad—like, to the point where one morning I woke up, and I felt like my soul was crying. I didn't have tears, but I felt there was a deep sense of sadness. And then bubbled up the fear. And then it's so—it's really interesting when we accept and let it go. It's almost like layers of emotion sit under another layer, another layer. But the stories—the narratives that sit within each layer.<br>Yeah, and you know, it's not—the other thing too is like a lot of the times, I go, "Okay, it's all in your mind." The narratives drop into your heart. People that know me and listen to me know I practice it. It's not always easy to drop into my heart, and there's a different energy than sitting in the mind going, "I shouldn't—I know I am—whatever the story is." <br>But that in itself—and I think that before we came on the show, I was telling you how I haven't been sleeping for about six weeks. I think it's also because I'm letting go of stuff. Yeah, and because I'm letting go of my baggage, I feel like there's more light coming through or something coming through.<br>Absolutely. Your comments are amazingly astute and appropriate because there are thousands of layers—sometimes hundreds or thousands of layers—that we build on top of fear. And the ego—that just means the portion of us that's rejecting and trying its best to fix this huge problem of separation that we have—is really trying to reclaim power however it can. Anger is an example of trying to reclaim power that we actually perceive we've lost. "Give me back that power.<br>I'm angry now." That's okay. That's okay if you feel that. Follow the roots, and you don't have to go all the way to the bottom root all at once. In fact, you can't usually because the ego does a really good job. You have done a really good job of protecting yourself—all the layers.<br>So, what do you meet? Just what's arising in this moment. And if you fully accept and investigate this moment's emotion and feeling and whatever you're experiencing now—like you describe—then that will give way to the next layer as you're ready. And then that will give way to the next layer, and that will give way to the next layer. And it's okay if that takes 10 seconds, and it's okay if it takes 100 years.<br>It doesn't matter. It's your willingness to accept whatever is arising in this moment because the deeper parts of you will lift up those parts that need to be healed as you're ready and as you're able and willing.<br>And the magic ingredient, then, is your willingness to feel it—to own it, to be weak, to be vulnerable, to feel the way that you feel. Like, you know, we often think that power is—you know, we think power means something in our world. True power is love. Love is the true power. And love is accepting and open, and it feels everything, and it's open. And so, when we can practice that in ourselves with all of our crap—all of the traumas, my goodness—that's powerful stuff. That's what we're here to do.<br>And that's exactly the kind of process I went through to face and process the fear that I came here to process. I went through years of EMDR therapy after I had post-traumatic stress after a health event when I was 22. I was so dissociated from my younger life actually that for a while, I couldn't even remember much of up until the age of 22. I was so traumatized and dissociated. <br>And through years of what's called EMDR therapy—it's just a modality to process those layers—I processed layer after layer after layer. And after years of doing this, I thought, "Oh my gosh, that's got to be the root layer. Oh my gosh, that's got to be the root layer." One day, I did find the root layer. My God, was it terrifying. But it's okay. It's okay. Like, if we can meet and process that, that is the depth to which the expansion occurs.<br>So, I just want to encourage everybody because at the heart of all this, there is nothing to fear. If you could just at least for now take that intellectual reminder: "I don't have to be afraid. I can face all that crap down in there. I can feel anything. Your consciousness is deeper than your deepest crap."<br>It's so true. I love the way that you describe that. And I think it's really important for us to maybe make a mention for our viewers and our listeners because I did this, and I learned this as a mistake because I always used to always say, "Drop into your heart. You know, it's we're all about love." And the thing is, sometimes it's almost like we're bypassing the layers if we just go for the love. <br>But then I feel like now—and I don't know if it's because I've done the work—that when I do drop into my heart, I feel it's a lot easier. That now that I've gotten rid of my baggage, or is it the fact that now I've loosened the boundaries of my baggage, let's say, that now when I do drop into my heart, the expansion is a lot freer? So, what are your thoughts around that? I'm not too sure if you can just drop into your heart and bypass those layers, and the love will—you know, they say love is that highest vibration that will dissolve all low vibrational frequencies.<br>Yeah, so as you process the layers, the native love automatically shines up and through you. It's like life itself (with a capital L) can rise up. So, it's not a matter of like you can intellectually choose to focus on love at any time. That's wonderful; that's good. But the true masters—you'll notice like people who have really processed the human experience—they just have this deep joy about them all the time. And it's not pretend; it's just a native wellspring of joy because all the layers of crap have been processed. They don't have to go find it; it just arises. It's just the way of life is to be in joy.<br>It's okay if we don't feel that all the time. We don't need to judge ourselves. We can recognize that we still have form that we have lost ourselves in association with. And by the way, I'll mention meditation here too because practicing meditation is super helpful for this because you gain that space that you were talking about, and you also gain greater and greater connection with the true source of power, which is consciousness itself—your awareness itself. Not the thoughts, not all the thinking, not all the stories, not all the—you know, this object hitting this object. You know, we do that in our thinking mind all day long. That's not the true source of power.<br><br><br>So, when we can really practice getting in touch with that awareness, we find there also love is the bedrock. And everything else that's making us not feel love—making us not feel love in quotes—is an illusion. It's something that's not true that we've lost ourselves in association with. So, yeah, it's automatic. It rises up as we process those layers—as we really process them.<br>I love the way that you described that, Christian. And the other thing too, I think also the practice—the non-attachment, the non-resistance, the non-judgment—is really important to practice. And I say to practice because I haven't perfected it—to get to that joy piece. Because that internal—we actually had a lady, Dr. Joy, on the show just last week, and she talks about how joy is an internal driver rather than happiness. People very often say, "Once I get that job, I'll be happy. Once I get more money or that relationship, I'll be happy." But she was talking about how our natural way of being is joy. And that's—and it is very much about tapping into that.<br>But even that in itself—I think that and I spoke to a couple of people that listened to the show—it's like, "Well, how do I tap into that? I've never experienced that deep joy." So, okay, so there are different layers. There are two different things to mention here. One is there are different layers of constraints. We'll start with that. So, that means that each spirit has engaged into a human experience that has its own set of constraints—biological constraints, circumstantial constraints, the constraints of upbringing and how we were taught and conditioned, you know, the beliefs that we were surrounded with—all that stuff.<br>And the second is that okay, so there is a uniqueness to each individual. And I'm trying to tie this back. When we combine the uniqueness of each individual and the different levels of constraints, it can feel like for some people that the levels that separate where they are and that native joy is like it's so thick that we don't even feel it anymore. And how can I find it because all I know is hell? But it's that depth of form association.<br>So, we say that the first is the level of constraints themselves, and the second is how does the spirit form associate? How deeply does it associate with thinking, with beliefs? How deeply does it cling on to beliefs for safety? How deeply does it cling on to objects, relationships, drugs, you know, whatever? Those two things are happening. The deeper we engage into form and our association with it, the more distance we vibrationally feel from that true native joy.<br>But the thing is, our true nature is always the joy. It never actually left. So, even if you don't remember it in your entire human life, it is who you are still. It is where you came from. It is where you'll return to, even if you don't have conscious memory of it. That's okay. And so, you can start small. That would be the main recommendation I would say. Find in your day-to-day—and I love that you're differentiating joy from happiness because when I use the word joy, I'm referring to that same deep being-level fullness of being and joy. I don't know what word to use that is native to us.<br>And for each person, that may mean something different. And so, you can follow your intuition—sense in your body, sense in your mind: What is love calling me to in this moment versus what is fear calling me to in this moment? It's okay if it's going and watching a television show. It doesn't have to be some great mystical thing. It's okay if right now I just want to be by myself. That's okay. Or right now, I feel sad, and you honor yourself by feeling why you're sad. You know, whatever the calling is of that joy, it's always reaching up to us. It's always calling to us, even if there are 27,000 layers between that joy and how deep we've gone into the constraints and how deep we've gone into the form associations.<br>And I love that you referenced non-attachment because that specifically speaks to that second one—that is that we associate so deeply with form—with the body and the name and the job and the activities and the things we got to do and the thoughts and on and on and on. It's very powerful actually if we take pause and just allow the moment to be. You don't actually have to do anything. I know that's so counter to what we've been deeply conditioned here in the world of form to think. Nothing is required of you. Nothing. You are a being of total freedom and joy and love. You're worthy just the way you are. There's nothing that you absolutely have to do. You can be in this moment. You are worthy of the peace and the joy of who you really are, and you can feel it in this moment in whatever small way and follow that signpost of your intuition towards it and whatever that means for you.<br>I love that. I got pictures of the joy like it's already—it's an internal light within you, and it's always there. It's always shining. But it's how it's activated—it's depending on us. In other words, the joy is always there. It could be as simple as, "What is it that I want to be doing right now?" It could be as simple as, "I'm going to eat a Lindt chocolate and watch a movie," or "I'm going to do some journaling," or "I'm going to do some meditation." But that's that internal soul voice—the joy of, "This is what I desire to do."<br>Absolutely. I mean, we live in a society where we are deeply conditioned to focus on things we don't really want to focus on. Whereas the nature of the soul in realities of form that are thought-responsive in higher realms is quite different. The natural way is to focus on what you like and have fun with and enjoy. And the more you focus on that, the more you get of it. So, that—and by the way, just as a side tangent comment—that's why a lot of little children, if their parent says to them, "You shouldn't take this thing that you just took," or "You shouldn't do this thing you just did," and they say, "But I want it," that's not just a sign of immaturity; it's an intuition expression.<br>But for adults, we usually have spent decades focusing on things we don't really prefer. And so, the step back towards peace can be—yeah, turn your attention towards something that you want to be focusing on right now. That's great; that's wonderful. This is a big playground; use it.<br>Yeah, and I think as that—we become too serious. We've forgotten how to have fun. Yeah, and I think that just even to bring more play into your life—whatever that is for every individual—I think that's in itself is going to add a bit of a skip to your step.<br>Absolutely. There's a beautiful Seth quote that reminds me of. He said, "On one hand, you take life too seriously. On the other hand, you don't take play seriously enough." I love that quote because it's so true. We're serious, and we don't put enough effort and energy into playing and enjoying life. Life is an active enjoyment. We've only made it deeply serious by all of our form associations and beliefs that we've enshrined. But our true nature is fun and joy and freedom. So, yeah, it's wonderful if we can take life less seriously and go play—however that means.<br>We don't have to protect these identities that we want to protect. You know, "Oh, I can't go run out in the rain because I'm going to get wet, and people will think I'm crazy." No, you can run in the rain. It's fine. You know, you can be who you are. I love running in the rain, and sometimes I will let people know that.<br>My trick sometimes, if I am having a moment—I call it a moment—and a moment could be anything: you're experiencing a little bit of frustration, annoyance, whatever that may be—I'll skip. And just the skipping in itself takes away the heavy energy in your body, right? And then your mind's going, "Hang on a minute. You're telling me you're frustrated, but you're skipping." And it does—it really shifts my paradigm like that. I mean, my trick anyway.<br>What? Oh, I love it. I'm going to use that. I'm going to use that. That's a great trick.<br>So, I'm conscious of your time as well, and in the essence of time, I just want to unpack your book a little bit: A Walk in the Physical: Understanding the Human Experience Within the Largest Spiritual Context. Talk us a little bit because I know the book represents a non-linear reality model, and I'd love to understand how does that differ to conventional reality or the understanding of conventional reality?<br><br><br>Sure. So, to the latter question, the way that we understand conventional reality today is based on our local world of form and its local rules. But that entire local rule set is not fundamentally real. So, you can't start with the assumptions of the physical and arrive at the totality of all things. You have to move towards that which does transcend all things, which is consciousness itself.<br>So, as a metaphor, if you were going to go play the video game Minecraft, you know, and then you're in the Minecraft world, and then in Minecraft, someone says, "How do you explain that there could be a higher dimension? Show me the blocks." Well, you don't need blocks because the blocks are non-fundamental; they've been created anyway. So, that is why I feel that Spirit was leading me to present the information in a way that's non-linear because we like—and I'm a linear type; I'm a project manager by trade. You know, I'm a very historical, very left-brain type individual. So, if I was going to write this by myself, it would be quite linear.<br>But the way that I felt led by Spirit to write it was to present chunks in a way that is useful for anybody. So, everybody is growing at their own rate, and there are many important ideas that need to be concurrently presented. And so, the book is an attempt to do that and to put it within a short framework that describes in concise language the first part of the book—maybe 13 or 14 pages long—what's going on in the human experience. And then that 13 or 14 pages points to all these coexisting ideas.<br>I do briefly recount my pre-birth experience in the introduction, but it's not really about my pre-birth experience. It's not about my pre-birth experience; it's about your experience. It's about our experience as consciousness here in the human experience. And I want to encourage folks to really sense deep down. I feel like the book was guided over six years through me by Spirit in a way that hopefully will help the reader sense and feel and actually know that multi-dimensional part of themselves that transcends the physical and is of love and joy already. Yeah, that's the idea.<br>How has the book changed your life?<br>Yeah, so that's a good question. So, first of all, I give the book away for free online in that it's available to be read online for free. It's never been about money. I just really felt compelled to share. Like, when I started having out-of-body experiences and this pre-birth memory returned, I was like, "Oh my gosh, I just have to tell people." Like, I was so motivated. My wife would laugh at me because I was so excited to think of any way I could to share with people. And I quickly found that you can't just knock on someone's door and tell them they're a multi-dimensional being.<br>Anyway, after some years, I began to feel the chunks of information come. I took them down, I put them together into a format, I felt Spirit's guidance as to how to arrange the book, and I just felt this bone-level calling like I just needed to make this thing physical. It was like I just knew I needed to do it while I was physical. And then the moment that I pushed the publish button and self-published, I felt this like, "Okay, I can let go now. Like, now it's okay. No matter what happens, no matter what—if it's one person that ever sees this book, that's fine."<br>However, it has been very well received. I've reached—I've met so many amazing people. I have people reaching out to me every day. A lot of people say it's really changed their lives. And it's funny because they say, "Oh, you wrote this great book," and it's like, "It's not me. Like, I'm just the person who facilitated it." And I feel strange like someone asked me to sign it, and I'm like, "How can I sign it? It just can't be signed. This is not a human thing." So, I feel like it's not even mine; I'm just a gatekeeper to it.<br>But the response has been overwhelmingly positive. I've met so many amazing people. I've probably met almost 50 other pre-birth experiencers by now, so I know I'm definitely not alone. And there's been an incredible community that's developed over time with people talking to each other. And I feel like it's just a tool out in the world. And very simply, it's my life's work. You know, it's the thing that I know that I can leave, and it will be in the physical, and that's good.<br>Well, we'll have the link in the show notes. I think that's very beautiful, and you have to accept you played a part in it as well, Christian. Facilitated it or the words because I feel that the way that you described—from a soul perspective, it's hard to put it into language—very hard. So, yeah, so they—you played a big part in putting this book together.<br>Yeah, thank you. I feel that as a soul, one of the things that I very much enjoy doing is taking the vast and making it succinct and concise. So, I feel that was helpful in being able to do this. It is difficult to put into language. It's actually not even the specific word choice; it's the words you don't use that are really important because English has only got like five words. I mean, that's how it feels. You try to write about love, and you've got like one word—love—and it means so many things. You know, or Spirit or Consciousness. And it's like, you know, I'd come back from meditation, and it's like, "Oh my gosh, Consciousness is all things. I can't possibly put any words on this. How do I?"<br>And so, then like I remember just writing even one sentence one day and feeling like maybe I should just not write any words because any word will be blasphemy. It will be so inaccurate. But on the other hand, is that a reason not to try? No. But that's why I'm very clear in the book to say, "Oh, no words. This is not the truth. It can't be articulated in words." That's very important to remember. It is really hard to put anything into words when you're working with that kind of vibrational frequency from my understanding.<br>Absolutely. So, Christian, the way that we love to wrap up the show is we love to ask our guests to leave three shiny golden nuggets. And that could be like three practical exercises for our audience.<br>Sure. So, instead of exercises, I'll just leave three ideas. The first is that there is absolutely nothing to fear. Like, in my father's example of being a little kid, there are no monsters in the closet. Even in death, even in war, even in pain. And when we really, really deeply explore that—even in a very small way—like, if you do a very small amount of processing, that you are helping the entire collective to heal. Like, you are a powerful being. Don't surrender to this idea of hopelessness that society has kind of bought into and heaped upon us. No, it is a very hopeful situation. So, please know that just by meeting your own fear, you really are helping the whole.<br>And the second thing is you are multi-dimensional. You really are. You exist in other reality systems right now. I know that sounds super wild, but if you sufficiently let go of your association with the physical and your focus on the sense data of the physical, you really can touch those higher realms. And as the vibration of the collective consciousness is increasing, that's becoming more and more normal and natural. And so, having that firsthand experience—even if it's a small experience—can really go a long way to help you see, "Oh, this is real. Like, this is not just a new religious thing. This is really the nature of our being."<br>And the third thing I would say is the most powerful thing that we can do here is to love. And love can mean so many different things. You will know in your life—in any simple moment—what love means. It can mean a smile; it can mean acceptance; it can mean enjoying something; it can mean helping the person next to you. It's not about scope; it's about quality of intention. And we all can do that. We all can bring that loving intention to whatever moment we're in. And it's far more powerful than it appears on the surface.<br>You know, I think a lot of us think, "Oh, what's important is how the objects are arranged today." You know, we're really focused on how the objects are arranged. Don't worry about the objects; it's just a big illusion anyway. What's important is the quality of being with which you are meeting your circumstances. And you can always make that choice to move one step towards love and joy.<br>Yeah, I love all three. I do. You know, Christian, I feel so calm now. When we first got together before the show, I was like really buzzing, but I feel really sedated and calm now. So, I wanted to say thank you so very much for allowing me to experience this in this space. I did really connect with one of them because one of the things that I'm currently experiencing—even though some of the things are really tough in our life, and this is for all of us—no matter where you are at crossroads or any point in your life, that as hard as it may be, just know that it serves a purpose. And I think that's really important to understand that once we make those shifts, you're not just doing it for yourself. For those people that lack self-worth, that don't think about themselves, think beyond yourself, right? So, you're not only expanding your life, you're helping others as well. So, you're helping not just you as a soul expand with those experiences, but the people around you and beyond.<br>Like, absolutely. Oh, absolutely. That's very, very powerful advice. Thank you.<br>So, Christian, we'll have everything in the show notes. Where's the best place—where do you hang out the most?<br>So, I actually don't have my own channels, but I do have a website: awalkinthephysical.com. I can be emailed at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a> I apologize if I'm delayed in responding; I sometimes get a lot of emails, but I'm happy to try to help if I can. And I'm on Facebook.<br>Yeah, great. Thank you so much, Christian, for your wealth of wisdom, for your time, your energy. It's been an honor and a pleasure to have you. So, Namaste for coming on the show.<br>Namaste to you. Thank you so much.

I want to just have a, Can I just have a small, tiny bit of memory? And they said, Yes, you can do that, but it will make the journey more difficult."  <br>Host: I'd like to welcome to the show, Christian Sundberg. How are you doing, Christian?  <br>Christian: "Great, sir. How are you?"<br>Host: I'm good, my friend. Thank you so much for doing this. We've been trying to get this going for a while now, and I'm so happy that we finally matched our schedules and we're here to talk about your fairly unique, entertaining experiences of life. You've lived a boring life so far, apparently.<br>Christian: None of us live boring lives on Earth.  <br>Host: That's very true. That's very, very true. So you have a very unique point of view on your experience. I mean, we've had near-death experiences, we've had other out-of-body experiences, but you had a pre-birth experience. And you're the first person I've ever spoken to who's had a pre-birth experience. So can you explain to the audience, what is a pre-birth experience?  <br>Christian: Yeah, sure. Thank you. So first, let me just say that, okay, first of all, I have to disclaim that there is no language to describe any of this. We're gonna do our best, but the language of Earth is based on our local world and its assumptions. And our true nature transcends assumptions. So fair enough, assumptions like, you know, linear time and discrete location, for instance, we actually transcend that physical context. So I'll try to make comments, but I just have to disclaim that the language vastly falls short. It's like, as soon as we open our mouths, we're just inaccurate, you know? So yeah, my body is 42 years old right now. Up until about the age of five or six, I had some pre-birth memory. I remember choosing this life and coming to Earth. That memory left me completely between the ages of six and 30.  <br><br><br>Host:  Before you continue, what was it like being a 5- or 6-year-old dealing with this kind of information? Because I barely remember what I was like at four or five. But I know I didn't have the cognitive ability to deal with that kind of information. So how did you deal with it?<br>Christian: Yeah, it was very natural. It's the most natural thing in the world, actually. I remember being in a diaper and just barely being able to walk and being aware of what I'll share today. Okay. It seemed very natural and normal. Nobody else talked about it. I mean, I knew we're not really from here. You know, we're just coming to experience this place and have this human experience. And nobody else really talked about it. I didn't talk about it. I just thought everybody knew. Nobody else talked about it.  <br><br><br>Host: So at the age of six, you lost the memory. Do you remember losing this?<br>Christian: No, no, it's just kind of the more I became associated with the human character, the more deeply I became associated with form, you know, with the story, with the objects, with the identity. The more distant it became until it was gone. And then I didn't remember it at all. You know, I had no, I didn't even remember that I had remembered, you know, up until the age of 30. When I took up a long-term meditation practice, and much to my surprise, I first began to have non-physical experiences after a few months of out-of-body experiences, very eye-opening, very worldview-altering, you know, very in-your-face, not subtle experiences. And at the same time, I began to have this pre-birth memory return. And it was not strange. It was the most natural thing in the world. It was like, there were leaves on the ground, somebody just blew the leaves off of the ground, and there's the grass. You know, I mean, like, it was not strange, but it was so real, so much, even more real than what I experienced day to day. <br>And these memories both seem incredibly ancient and also like they're happening right now. Like, they feel like they're millions of years ago, but they're also alive right now. I don't know how to describe that. It's not like an earthly memory. And I shared it with a couple of people, and they seemed to say, "Oh, wow, that's pretty extraordinary." And it didn't even occur to me that it was extraordinary. I didn't share it for eight years or so because, you know, I'm a working professional. It's not the kind of thing you talk about, you know? It clears a room pretty quick, you know? Plus, and then anyway, so it's not going to be well-received by various groups, including maybe conservatively-minded folks. <br>And so I just didn't share it. But I felt compelled to share, and about four years ago, I just got this intuitive nudge like, "The ground is fertile now. It's just like the ground is just fertile enough now that there is benefit to sharing this." So I did. I shared with Mira Kelly, who happened to be Wayne Dyer's past-life regressionist, so she was familiar with this content. And after I shared it, I thought, "Okay, I got it off my chest, whatever. I never have to talk about it again." But it took off. It became very well responded to. I've met so many people that have had similar experiences. I've probably met probably 40 or so other pre-birth experiencers by now. <br>So I'm definitely not alone. And what's really interesting is when those people are able to reach out to me and say, "I have the same memory of the same place or the same experience pre-life." And I just think that's so amazing because I can feel the vibrational distance between there and here. And if we can come all the way down here to the Earth experience and meet here on these topics and make that connection, it's just so cool. It's a really amazing energetic thing to do. Yeah, so and then I published a book, A Walk in the Physical. I spent about six years writing it with the help of spirit, really. I received intuitive chunks at a time. I never felt like I sat down and wrote it myself. I felt like I was being guided throughout that process. <br>And I felt like a bone-level accomplishment when I finally pressed the publish button and put it out in the world. You know, it's available for free on my website. It's not about money. I just want to share the information. I'm very passionate about who we really are, you know, what this human experience really is. And it's very exciting to me to share that because the actual truth, like the real, concrete truth of the spiritual context in which we exist, is wonderful. It's so amazing and full of love and joy and vibrance and freedom. And I'm very passionate about sharing that because we live in a world that is often less so. You know, we have a lot of fear. So anyway, just some comments about how that emerged.  <br><br><br>Host: So okay, so when you started your meditative practice and you had this kind of awakening, what were the memories that came back to you? Can you talk a little bit about the pre-birth experience?<br>Christian: Yeah, sure. Okay. So I'll try to go in order, but again, there is a sequence to these memories, but it's also beyond what we would call linear sequence. So it's difficult to describe. Okay, so I remember long, long ago, before I had ever been physical at all, had any physical incarnations, coming across a being who had been physical. And I could feel from this being the quality of his nature, his essence. This is very hard to describe. <br>And in those systems, we share telepathically. Everything's telepathic. We just have a constant sharing of feeling and information and knowing, you know? It's not like here, where we have to throw clunky words at each other. There, you can actually feel the other being as a part of you. And the environment is part of you. You're connected to all things. And I felt from him this amazing joy and power. And I asked him, "My goodness, what could you possibly have done to be this? <br>And do you feel as much joy and power as I feel that you feel?" And he shared, "Yes." And he shared with me this huge amount of information and feeling and context. And one of the main things he shared with me is that he had lived a physical life. While he lived many lives, one in particular that he shared was a time that he had suffered physically from a long-term chronic health condition. <br>And it was very painful. But the way that he chose to meet that experience, to sort of describe the quality of the intention that he brought into that experience, allowed a refinement of his being. And it was so beautiful and so full of power. And I said, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I'm gonna do that." Which is very, like, very inspired.  <br>Host: Where do I sign up? Where do I sign up?<br>Christian: Yeah, exactly. And he said, kind of playfully, like, "Yeah, that's what they all say. Like, you don't know how hard it is. You don't know. You just don't know how difficult it is." And I said, "No, I mean, I want to do this." And he said, "Well, go talk to your guides." So I don't have right after that, but I know I lived many times. And then I found this being later and shared with him that I was on this path. And he was encouraging for the path. <br><br><br>Okay, so but the majority of the pre-birth memory that I have is of a time somewhat immediately preceding this life where I had taken a long break after being physical. And I remember this guide coming to me over and over again and asking every once in a while, "Are you ready to go back here? Are you ready to go back yet?" And just putting them off, like, "No, I'm not ready yet. No, I'm not ready yet." And finally saying, "Okay, I'm ready." Like, basically reminding me of my own intention to do this. <br>And so okay, I said, "Okay, I'm ready." So then I remember with this guide reviewing what I can only describe as my state, like who I am, who I've been, who I was. This is very hard to articulate. It's like a, I don't know how you would describe it, like a graph with many different qualities. And you could even say virtues or something, you know, just areas of knowing, of experiential evolution that you knew more or less, something like that. And there was this one area that was just blatantly obvious that I needed to work on. I don't think "need" to work on because we don't have to. <br>It's not about need. We choose to do this. But there was this one area that it was like, "Oh, wow, I really should do something about that." And it was this really deep fear. And it was a fear that had bested me in a previous experience. And in that previous experience, I had turned into something of an egoic monster because of this fear. And I had damaged many other people through the fear. Because fear is at the root of ego, you know? We act out of ego because there's some fear down there that we haven't processed, something we haven't come to terms with. So this fear was very overwhelming. And I remember asking, "Is it even possible? Like, has any other being in creation ever dealt with a fear that's this low vibration in this specific way?" Because it was like a very specifically angled vibration. I don't know how to describe this, but a very specific fear vibration. <br>And I knew even from that point of view, it was very low vibration. And I remember the being saying to me, "Yes. And in fact, you have all time available to you to do so. There's no hurry." And I just knew, and this is how strange to me as the human, you know, because from this point of view, I know how difficult it has been in this life. But I just said, "If it can be done, I'll do it." Like, I just knew because I knew the depth of my being and the depth of what we all are, the unconquerable life that we are. And so then they brought me a life, a physical life that was appropriate for this intention of meeting the fear. And it wasn't this lifetime. It was one just before this. And I reviewed that life. And I accepted that life. <br>And then I remember accepting the veil. Okay, so the veil is just a term. It's just a metaphor, but it means the constraints that go along with being physical and having an incarnate experience, that is the limitation of knowledge, having your memory cut off, and having your connectedness disappear. And it felt to me like the best way I can describe this is the metaphor of like a sound amplifier that produces a pitch. Like, it started at a very high vibration, and then you turn down the knob. And then when you get to the bottom, you turn it down some more, and then more, more, more, and then crank it down some more, and then crank it down some more. <br>That's how it felt in the body of my awareness, to plummet down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, into the vibrational place of being physical in the womb. And once I arrived, I was like, "I am not doing this. There is no way I'm going to tolerate a lifetime. This is so dark. This is such low vibration." I had so much fear immediately that came up. And so I mustered my might, you know, and I fought the veil. I fought my way out. And I was successful at doing that. But I realized that I had killed the fetus that was to be my body. And I ended the life. And I had a life review, just like near-death experiences describe. <br>Even though I'd never physically been born, I was responsible for how I had affected the mother. And not only the mother, but hundreds of other people who were affected by the mother because of my fear. You know, and I had all these great intentions going in, but I could see very objectively, "Wow, I have a lot of fear. I gotta do something about this." So, like, from that point of view, you know, everything is okay. It's just a play. You know, it's a big play. But still, I could see like, "Oh, wow, you know, I really need to grow in this way." So I spent some time practicing surrendering to the veil in a place that I can only describe as a veil acceptance simulator. It was like going to a room where they dunk you under the water of a dark pool. <br>And they push you into this—it's just a metaphor, but it's kind of close—it's like being pushed underwater in a pool. And then you can stay under there and see how long you can hold your breath, and then you cry uncle, and they let you out because it's just a simulator. Whereas in the real veil, you can't cry uncle. You have to let it sink in all the way. So I remember practicing, and then I still wanted to do this intention of meeting the fear. So they brought me this life. So, this life now is Christian. And I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail. And I knew that this life was not as appropriate as the first one would have been. Like, you know, you can't put numbers on it, but if I just, being crude about it, the first one, if it was like a 98 or 99% good match, this one was like 87 or something. You know, I don't know. It just was good, and it was good, but it wasn't as perfect as the first one. But it was still very good.  <br><br><br>Host: Real quick, I mean, you said you reviewed this life in detail. Do you mean that you were able to see Christian from beginning to end, what you are going to experience, and how this quote-unquote game or play or movie was going to play out, and what it would do for you in your growth as a result?  <br>Christian: Yes, but it was not a... So it was like a probability tree. So it's like if you took a tree and laid it on its side and started at the trunk and then worked your way out to the branches, it was like that. It was like I started at a point of context, and I knew that my choices and the choices of every other player in the game would be influencing each other, and it would nudge certain paths to happen. And there were some that were more likely or less likely. And I knew that it was very likely that I would suffer a trauma in my 20s because of this biology. I knew that this body has biological limitations that other bodies don't. And I knew that that would help facilitate, among other things, this trauma that will befall me in my 20s. <br>And that trauma would give me the chance to be crushed and to re-experience this fear. And I say "chance" because from that point of view, it was seen as an opportunity, you know? Like, from here, the victim, the ego rises up right away and says, "Oh, no, I'm not okay with this. I would never sign up for this." But from that point of view, I knew that the incredible opportunity that was being handed to me in the chance to re-experience this fear and to meet it and to try to integrate it and heal through it—oh, my gosh, the amount of profound personal growth and even the growth of all that is that was possible through that was breathtakingly huge. <br>But anyway, to your question, yeah, so I reviewed what it would be like to be me in these various branches. Like, there were events in it, but it was less about events and more about what it would feel like to be me, to be exactly me in this circumstance or at this age. I remember reviewing it in terms of ages. I remember being aware of one certain potential exit point as an example that hasn't arrived yet. I remember reviewing qualities about the life and then making requests. Like, for instance, I remember asking if I could be intelligent again because I knew that I had been intelligent in the last few lives. And it was a trait that I preferred, and I didn't want to experience a life without that quality. And they said, "Yes, you can do that." <br>And I knew that certain qualities of my parents would be very important. Like, for instance, I knew that my father would instill confidence in me. And that confidence would be paramount for me to have like a rock to stand on to meet the fear. You know, and that was something that my father did for me. You know, he was very accepting and always lifted me up and gave me that confidence. Not only my father, my mother, my grandparents, you know, that was not an area I needed to be challenged in this time. I needed the confidence to meet this fear. <br>And I also remember asking—and excuse my hoarseness, by the way, I think my wife, as I mentioned, my wife has COVID, and I'm a bit under the weather right now—so I remember asking, "Can I... I don't want to forget everything this time. I want to just have a, Can I just have a small, tiny bit of memory?" And they said, "Yes, you can do that, but it will make the journey more difficult." And I knew why. I could feel it was because the contrast here would be even greater to have some recollection of that higher vibrational state of being and still be here. It's such a pronounced contrast that having even a glimmer of that conscious knowledge added to the contrast. But especially, I knew even that contrast, like all contrast, was an opportunity for growth. So I accepted, and I remember there having to be a moment to say yes, to actually accept the life. <br>I don't remember that moment, but I do remember being in like a waiting area, and then this guide coming to me and then just suddenly grabbing my attention like, "Go now!" Like, very abrupt, like almost rude, not rude, but like grabbing me by the shoulders like, "Earth time, buddy! Like, not later, right now!" And I was like, "Okay, now." And then like locking into that, and then being in this—how do I describe this? It's like I've described it like a technician's chamber or like a mechanic shop that was over the Earth. I could see a shaft below me with the Earth below. And there were these beings there who were very technical in nature. And they are very, very skilled at matching the veil to you, to the individual. Because like, the individual has so many rich qualities, and the life and the body and the circumstances have their own energetic thing going on. <br>And they, like, I don't know, they make everything fit. They make everything jive. And they're able to make this organic connection work. Like, the veil is like an organic blanket or something, and they're able to fine-tune that. And I remember then being over this pit and them asking me one last time, "Are you sure? Are you sure you want to do this?" Because I knew once I said yes, I was strapped in for the ride. It's like getting on a roller coaster, you know? Once you strap in, you can't get out until the ride's done. It was a little bit like that. <br>And I remember saying, "Yeah, I'm ready." And then again, this huge plummet and vibration down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. And having all of my knowing disappear, and all my connectedness disappear, and all my memory just not there anymore. And coming down into this vibrational point that I can only describe like arriving to the vacuum of space, like a place that had no heat. <br>There's like nothing there, but also simultaneously very, very dense. Like, the body was like being shoved inside of a tiny tuna can. And simultaneously cold and empty. It's so hard to describe. And this time, I just focused on not fighting it. You know, just like, "Okay," because I remembered the time before when I had rejected it and ended the life. So I just let the veil do what it would do to me. And I surrendered to it. I just surrendered to the veil. And eventually, from the point of being in the body, I remember sending one message back to the technicians: "Did it take?" And then sending one message back: "Yes, it took." And then I felt really accomplished, actually, because even the act of making it to the physical is quite an accomplishment because it's such a vibrationally different place. <br><br><br>So then I was there for a while. And then eventually, I said, "You know what, I am not doing this. There is no way I'm going to tolerate a lifetime of this. I am not doing it." And my fear began to rise up again. And so once again, I began to summon my might to fight my way out. And as I did that, the most holy moment in my entire human life happened. The Great Spirit of God—what we call God, beyond all language, the great I Am of all things, Source—came to me and expanded me back out. And I felt all the universe within me. I felt our Sun, the Sun of Earth, churning within me. I felt its life. I felt its consciousness and its bliss, this deep, raging bliss of the Sun within me. And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." It's the most holy moment for me in this life because that's what we all are. <br>And it's like the most sensitive, personal experience. But after that, I was so relieved. It's like, "Oh, I didn't lose everything that I am," you know? Because I felt like I had lost all that I am. And so I stopped fighting. And I returned to being in the body and not fighting and just surrendering to the simple existence of being in the womb, you know? And the next memory I have is what seemed like a long time later, being born physically. I remember the shock, the cold, the light. I remember having no idea what was going on. Just looking up at these beings who were taking care of me, the nurses in the room, and being like, "Who are these beings?" Like, I had no idea what was happening, but it was intense. <br>I was so curious. I remember just being intensely curious. And it's funny because when I mentioned this memory to my father, he said, "That's exactly what you looked like." He said, "You had these wide-open eyes for a little baby, and you were looking around at everything with such curiosity." I remember that. I remember just being so curious. And I know they say that babies can't see, you know, certain distances. I don't understand how I remember this, but I do remember seeing the room. And later in my life, I drew the room from my memory, and I said, "You were here. Here was the bed. Here was the heating grate. Here was the window. <br>The doctor was standing here." And you know, she confirmed that that was how the room was laid out. But anyway, so after that, I don't have memory for quite a while, you know, until I was older. But I used to have assumptions about this life that I thought would apply because of the time I had been in the higher realities. Because I assumed qualities of our true nature that were true there would apply here. That's, yeah, not well, there's a lot that's different on Earth. Like, I remember assuming that we would be able to feel each other's emotions here. That turns out not to be the case much of the time. I remember assuming that anyone in a position of leadership or authority would be loving and wise. And that's not always the case on Earth, especially the larger, especially the higher up. I figured the higher up you were in society, you must be even more loving and wise. Because in higher systems, love and wisdom is the power. You know, so beings who are in positions of authority—with air quotes—you know, they're loving and wise. That's not always the case on Earth.  <br><br><br>Host: Not so much, my friend. Not so much if we look at our world today. No, it doesn't. It's almost the oddity when you find someone who's good and wise at that level of leadership. Your story's fascinating, man. It really, really is. I have a few questions. I have a handful of questions. When you, during this whole process—well, first of all, do you remember any other physical incarnations? Do you remember, like, any past lives?  <br>Christian: I have some snippet memories from other certain experiences. I remember being a woman who had given birth and having been pregnant a second time. And the fear that I've experienced in this life, I experienced as that woman because I was afraid of the pain of having to give childbirth a second time. That's just an example. So I have some brief memories like that. Not too much. You know, like, sometimes when I'm curious, I try to reach out to that, and I just get this gentle, like, "No, you don't need to know that." And I'm totally okay with that. You know, I respect the veil. I'm still veiled very much.  <br>Host: So you're not, you weren't Alexander the Great or someone like that, because everyone always is very famous in their past lives. Always. Francis of Assisi, you know?  <br>Christian: Nope! Nope!  <br>Host: Okay, so when you lost your memories, I'm assuming your life went down the road. I've read somewhere that you were working in the nuclear industry somewhere, and you were spiritual at this point?<br>Christian: Yeah, I think I've always been spiritual, but for the majority of my adult life—early adult life, at least—it was through a Lutheran Christian context. And, you know, part of my awakening process was a deconstruction of what, up until that point, had been my religious beliefs. I had to be humble enough to recognize that I had certain key ideas wrong. But I was always seeking, you know? <br>And it was that seeking that led me initially to the work of the physicist and consciousness explorer, Tom Campbell. And it was one sentence he said in one of his videos, actually, that sent me down this whole path. And, you know, so I'm very grateful to Tom. His book and his teachings helped a lot. The biggest thing he said was, "Go meditate. Go find out for yourself. Go see what you are, what your awareness is. Beneath thoughts, not the thoughts, not the stories, not the sensations. Go investigate very objectively what your awareness is." And I love that advice. I feel like I found so much through that. There are so many answers that are available to us through our true nature, you know, beneath the human thinking that seems to be so important to us every day.  <br>Host: So when you started to get these memories back, how did you handle the rush of knowledge and understanding? I mean, I'm assuming it was jarring at that late stage because, as we get older, we become more... it's not that we're not as malleable in our thought patterns, but it's harder.  <br>Christian: I understand what you're asking, but actually, I think in my case, it was a state of awareness that changed first. And then the memories were then natural. You know, as I grew more and more in awareness of what I really am, which is my awareness itself, consciousness itself, and less associated with the thinking and those firm identity thoughts that seemed to make us up, that was first. And then once that was where I was, larger aspects of myself began to rise up all on their own. So for me, it actually was not shocking. It was the more normal thing.  <br><br><br>Host: Yeah, and when did you decide to come out of the closet, as they say, with this information? You think it clears a room?  <br>Christian: Yeah, it does clear a room. No, I think about four and a half years ago or so, I decided to share. I felt intuitively nudged to do it. And after I shared the first time, I remember going for a walk and feeling relieved that I had shared it. But I also felt this energetic shift in the, like, branches. And I'm like, "What is that? That's interesting." It's a very personal story, you know? And it's like, I'm a normal guy. I don't consider myself special in any way. And I live a normal, you know, relatively normal American human life. So sharing did take some courage, especially because, in my case, my wife's parents are very conservative. And it did cause quite a social difficulty for us.  <br>Host: Thanksgiving dinner was rough, is what you're saying?  <br>Christian: Basically, yes. But, but on the other hand, what are we afraid of, right? You know, our true nature is what it is. I couldn't not share. In fact, when it first came back to me, I remember—this sounds so silly to me now—but I remember saying to my wife, "I'm going to create flyers. And I'm going to go and put them in people's mailboxes, and I want to tell people, 'You are a multi-dimensional being having a human experience, and there's nothing to fear.'" And she's like, "If you do that, you're gonna be that guy." And I was like, "Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be that guy." <br>So I didn't do that because that would make me that guy. And you know, that's not the way to reach people, I guess. But I was very excited. Like, when I realized this, like when I had out-of-body experiences, I mean, it's so eye-opening. You just want to go up to people and say, "You don't need to be afraid. You are a multi-dimensional being having a human experience. This whole thing is like a play that we've created for fun and for expansion and for creativity. There's nothing ultimately to fear." And when, because when we know that, when we know who we really are, man, we can live lives of joy, and we can shine that joy to each other. <br>We can be free here on Earth. We can actualize our true loving nature in the Earth context. That's what it's all about. You know, it's not all about moving objects and buying things and making big empires. No, it's the acts of love. It's the quality of intention that we bring into even the smallest moments, you know? Like, even how we pet a dog or smile at someone in the store or whatever. Those things, that genuine love and that genuine joy that we bring into Earth in even the smallest context, that's what matters. <br>The context itself is kind of like a big illusion, but we are spirit. Our consciousness, we are really aware, and we endure. We are this like the substance of what really is, and our intent, our ability to choose something, is our primary power. It transcends the physical. It operates through any reality system that we engage. So if we can evolve the quality of our intention towards love and past fear, that is lasting growth. That's lasting power and expansion that remains with us far past the end of these extreme limitations of this earthly experience.  <br><br><br>Host: So it's very much like—and I've said this on the show before—it's very much like playing a video game where the higher self, the soul, is the player, and then we are Zelda. And we're running around, and we, as players beyond the veil, we're like, "Oh, yeah, let's go down that road. He needs experience points in order to defeat the next level. And it's not going to be easy, and we don't want to go do that. But he's gonna probably die a couple of times beating up these ogres because he needs the experience level to be able to grow on the grind, right? So you have to keep doing it." So us up top, we're like, "This is the work we got to do. This is up, up, up." But I'm assuming for Zelda, it's terrifying.  <br>Christian: So, yeah. So I want to just make a comment here because that, so I understand that from the human perspective, it feels like we're just Zelda, and then there must be some higher soul. We're a part of this making these big old decisions, and here we are just stuck in the rat race.  <br>So I'm just, I just wanted—oh, there's more. Yeah. So it's more than just a connection. I just, this is important: the higher self is you, right? Like, the you that feels like you to you, the you that's making the decisions, that you that lifts your hand, is the higher self. It's the same you that's gonna be here after the body is gone. So sometimes we want to play Zelda without a sword.  <br>Host: You know, if we beat—here, you and I are of similar vintage—you know, Contra, you remember?<br>Up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start. How many times did you beat that game with the cheat code where you had all the power and all the guns, and you would fly through the game? I remember at a certain point, I'm like, "You know what, I'm gonna play this with one eye open," because I knew the game so well that I needed to challenge myself constantly. <br>And I would play the game again, like, "I want to, I can't play. I'm only going to lose. I can't lose one life. I have to do the entire thing without losing. If I lose a life, I start again. I'm not even going to." So I would challenge myself constantly because we had the secret code. So it's very, very similar to what we're doing. It is like that. <br>Christian: So you could say metaphorically, some of the higher, less constraining reality systems are like playing Contra with the cheat code on, so you have unlimited lives, and you can't fail. But then when you really want to play, and you really want to try to do it without the cheat code, guess what you find out? You're not as good as you thought you were.  <br>Right. Yeah, because it's a lot easier when you die like five minutes. Yeah, when you have the big sword, and you know where everything is, but all of a sudden, the sword is gone, and you're in hand-to-hand combat, it's not so easy anymore with the elders coming out at you.  <br>And that's how it is with Earth. So here we are, maybe with a broken body, yeah, or maybe with a circumstance where you were not given the love, the nurturing that you needed to grow, right? Site in us psychologically? Well, or maybe you have some context in your society that is very challenging. Maybe it's a war-torn context. There are so many rich, rigorous contexts on Earth. But what's really important to understand is that the contrast that Earth makes available is the tool. Like, we transcend the contrast. We are non-dual, you could say. You know, we transcend all the ups and downs of Earth, but we use it. We use the contrast. <br>And through it, we can refine and expand who and what we really are. That expansion is incredibly valuable and powerful. And not every being wants to play Contra without the cheat code. <br>But the beings who want to try—you could say, not everybody wants to climb Mount Everest. But there are those who go climb Mount Everest, and then when they get there, they're like, "Oh, my gosh, it's cold. There's no oxygen up here."  <br>That's correct. That is the nature sometimes of the human experience, right? It's cold, there may not be any oxygen. Whatever that metaphor might mean in your life. The question isn't whether or not it's cold. The question is what you do with it. The question is now, how do you meet this moment? Can you meet this moment with love rather than fear, whatever that means? All the things that love can mean: humility, compassion, gentleness, even with yourself, strength, you know, perseverance. All the things that love can mean rather than fear and all the protections of the ego. Can you do that even in your context? That's the name of the game. And it is an incredible opportunity. It's not some, you know, masochistic exercise. It is a gift. Being human is like being given a winning lottery ticket. And now that you're here, you get to decide what to do. It's amazing.  <br><br><br>Host: So then let me ask you that question. How are souls chosen? I'm assuming there are a limited amount of souls, though they keep growing. I mean, our population keeps growing. There's a limited amount of avatars.<br>Christian: Yeah, there's a limited amount of Zelda out there that we can play this game with. So how are souls chosen for this experience?<br>
Yeah, so when I can, so when I do remember, I mean, I certainly can't speak to the full depth of that question. Sure. But I can say at least two things. First of all, the soul has to be interested. Because we are so—we're totally free-will beings. Like, I mean, it sounds silly, but there are many beings who are not going to decide to come to this level of separation. Like, this is like going into outer space, you know? Not everybody wants to go into outer space. Why would you want to do that? That's crazy. Why would I want to feel this separate from everybody else?  <br>Host: It's like right now, Mars. There's a big talk about Mars, and like, who's gonna go to Mars? And in our lifetime, humans will probably go to Mars. And you ask the question, and some guys and gals are like, "I want to be first in line." Yeah, exactly. And the rest of us are like, "I don't need that experience. Thank you."  <br>I don't need to skydive. I'm solid in my life experience right now. But others, I need to do it every day. So it's just a different perspective.  <br>Christian: So no, you got it. And it's very much like that when it comes to physical incarnation. It's like skydiving. Not everybody is going to want to skydive. <br>Okay, so the first thing is they have to want to skydive. And the second thing is there has to be a level of proficiency. <br>And what I mean is, we have lots of experience as souls. It's not just the physical. It's not like there's physical and then one other reality, and that's it. There are countless reality systems, many with rules that are very, very different from our Earth experience. And for different purposes. And as souls, we engage all sorts of different experiences. And so, in order to play a human, you have to have a certain level of—the language is very lacking here—but soul proficiency, you know? You need to be ready, so to speak, to engage a context that's this rigorous. <br>And so then the guides are very adept at matching because they know the goal of the game, so to speak. And they understand us very well because they're very evolved, very loving, very wise. And so they are very good at, like, going through the database, you could say. You might think of it like putting in a search in a Google search or something. Like, they put in the parameters of you and your intentions, what you're looking for. They get back some results, they review the results, and then they take some to you and ask you, "What do you think about these?" Some people are given multiple lives to choose from. In my case, it was just that they brought me one. And then they brought me one because my intention was very specific. Other beings may have much less specificity with their intention for incarnation. And it's just like, "Give me whatever. I'll take any slot. I just want to get in. I just want to get some experience."  <br>So there was—I've heard from other near-death experiences and other spiritually evolved people that I've spoken to on the show that there are lifetimes that are called either vacation lifetimes or just like, "Hey, you know what, in this life, I've really had it. The last two or three lives have been pretty rough. I wouldn't just—let me just do this lifetime where I have a body that can absorb as many drugs and alcohol as humanly possible. I'd like to be rich. I'd like to have, you know, be able to do this and that. I just want to enjoy myself. Let's see what happens." And that's a lifetime. Because, you know, you and I both know, in the press, there's constantly these people who have these lives that put it out there. So have you—do you understand that? Does that make sense? And by the way, that's just one vacation. That's one avatar who wants to do a lot of drugs and wants to drink and be able to do—there are other ones as well. But I'm just curious, what's your thoughts on that?  <br>Yeah, so I didn't review that specifically in my pre-birth experience. But I do feel that we sign up for certain kinds of experiences, and relaxing experiences may occur. I'm reminded of one of the Seth Speaks comments. He says something like, "While they're typically very busy and active as souls, they might take a break by incarnating as a very simple life form for a while to just exist." And so I don't have firsthand experience with that, but I feel intuitively that that's probably correct, you know, that we can sign up for vacation-type experiences. That being said, like you said, it's not the context itself that makes a life of vacation. We can act—it's actually the quality of our being that enables, within a given level of constraint, us to have, you know, a more loving expression of joy or not. So, yes, we might sign up for less constraining lifetimes, depending.  <br>Host: Well, yeah, like if you sign up to be a fisherman in Fiji, and you never leave the island, and your entire life is about fishing, spending time with your family, living in paradise—not a rich person by any stretch of the imagination—but when you wake up in the morning, every day you wake up and you're in Fiji. That might be a lifetime, and that's a simple life in many ways.  <br>Christian: So yeah, it's the Fiji. It's not the Fiji itself. We actually apply the meaning to all the contexts, including Fiji. Fiji has very nice colors and temperatures by comparison to some other places on Earth. But we always apply the meaning to our life. So I'm just pointing that out because a vacation life is not specific to a location or even an occupation. It's the quality of being we bring into it and the meaning that we put onto a given context. And I'll just also say this, like, from my perspective, I suspect that when I'd like to rest, it's not going to be through an incarnation. There are ways to exist that are much less constraining. You know, it's not just that there's physical, and that's your only option. There are many other reality systems and states of being.  <br><br><br>Host: But this is the densest.<br>Christian: Yes, this is so. This is the—I remember, okay. I don't know if you want to go down this avenue, but I remember knowing—I know this is gonna sound really woo-woo—but I remember being aware as this universe was going to be created. And knowing that there was this intention being issued forth from Source but through us all. We were all involved to take this to the next level, like the next density, that was the new lowest density experience. And we were full of so much excitement at it. So it's like this—there's like this huge in-breath and out-breath thing of universes, you could say. And there's like this beautiful pause between. It's very hard to describe, but there are these moments where there's a pause, and then, "Okay, now we're going to take this to the next level." And there was so much excitement to be able to be this dense, to have this extreme level of engagement and contrast, because then the opportunity for expansion is that much more. It's a heavier weight to lift.  <br>Host: Exactly, it's a heavier weight to lift. <br>Christian: You're gonna grow. Your muscles are gonna grow much faster if you're lifting heavy.<br>
That's a great metaphor. It's like, why would you ever lay down on the weight bench and lift 100 pounds instead of 20? You know, that's a good metaphor for why would you? I mean, the metaphor certainly has limits, but it's not a bad metaphor for why we would sign up for challenging contexts.  <br>Right, exactly. There are profound opportunities in the context, even if, from the human point of view, they seem very difficult.<br>
Yeah, I mean, yeah, without question. Now, this is a concept I'd love to hear your thoughts on. And I've heard others speak about this—the idea of dealing a deck of cards, where you, as the higher self, the soul, is the dealer, if you will. And each card is a life. And you could have multiple lifetimes at the same time, but all still connected to the player in the game. Because, from my understanding, even from studying spiritual texts, the higher self, the soul, can do multiple things at the same time. If we can't, then Jesus has a lot of people on near-death experiences because Jesus is always working on near-death experiences. He's the hardest-working man up there, I'll tell you. So if he can't do that at the same time, he's got other doppelgangers working for him. So I'm assuming that beings can do multiple things at the same time, be in multiple places in time. So what are your thoughts on us being able to experience multiple lifetimes at the same time?  <br>Yes, yeah. So all linear time is a creation. It's not fundamental. It's a way of experiencing. Okay, so that's an important way to approach linear time because we tend to think of linear time as like a fundamental, you know, part of reality. Right? But actually, what's happening is not the physical universe. What's happening is your experience of the physical universe. And that experience takes place in sequence. Okay, but to the higher self, the higher self transcends that linear time sequence. And so, from our perspective, we could say that all is happening in one now. Now, this language is very limiting, and it's very difficult to speak to you from here because, again, we're coming from the very perspective of defined linear time. Like, we are at the extreme point, looking back, saying, "What do you mean, everything's happening all at once?" From the soul vantage point, I can at least say there's like higher time. And there is sequence that takes place, but it's all within the one now. That's the only way I can probably speak to that.  <br>Host: So it's possible, in other words. Yeah, there's a possibility of it.  <br>Christian: Yeah, in our metaphor of playing a video game, you can play more than one video game at once. There's no reason you can't play Zelda and Contra at the same time.  <br>It would be challenging, but for the higher self, it's not challenging. Like, in my pre-birth experience, when I reviewed all the possibilities of this life, I reviewed millions and millions of possibilities in seconds. You know, it was not hard, but the bandwidth is ridiculously wide. It's infinite. It's almost infinite. You know, it's—I don't know what to put words on. It's huge. So that's what the soul, you know, is working with. It's not like this. You can think of the human as like a subset of the soul, and this subset is bound by linear time, but the soul isn't.  <br>Host: Right, exactly. What is your understanding of soul groups?<br>Christian: Yeah, so I'm aware that soul groups exist. I don't have too much specific knowledge about them, but I have had times in my life when I've come across individuals who I felt were a part of my group. It's meant that people have different meanings for soul group. The way I'm using the term is not multiple characters have one soul. I'm talking about multiple souls that are of one vibrational affiliation or something. So I do feel that they exist and that they perform similar work. You could say, like, as souls, we have certain—oh, the language is so bad—certain qualities or capabilities that are unique to us. Like, each one of us is like a vibrational universe. And that vibrational universe has many colors and sounds and qualities and aspects. It's very hard to describe. So I feel that souls that are of a similar bend or intention work together and congregate. Because, in higher systems, geography is vibrational. It's not physical geography. Physical geography may occur in reality systems, but we tend to relate to those that we are vibrationally resonant with. Earth is the place where you can show up to people in a room, and they don't resonate. And now you get to be stuck with them.  <br>I've experienced that. But in higher systems, like, I'll just give a very brief example. One time, I was out of body, and I was doing something, and then this woman came to me who I know physically in my city. Her and I were in a mediumship circle together. And she got my attention. She's like, "Hey, it's Mary." And we're telepathically exchanging. She's like, "We're going to go to this other place." And I was like, "No, I'm going over here. I'll see you later." <br>And I just zoomed off and did my thing. At this one, trying to describe it was an energetic work that I was going to do. So there was no pretense. There's no social pretense. It's like, "No, I'm doing this." But two weeks later, when I saw her in person, when she opened her front door to me on Earth, she said, "You blew me off." I couldn't believe she remembered it. I was like, "I did? I can't believe you remember that." I didn't believe. I'm sorry. Like, from the human standpoint, you have to say you're sorry. But from the energetic standpoint, it's okay. Everybody is exactly who they are. It's okay if you resonate with that over there, and I resonate with this over here. That's great. You're who you are. I'm who I am. And so that vibrational, like, you know, you follow your intention where it wishes to go. You don't like sit there and make yourself, you know, you don't force proximity like you might do because of social convention on Earth.  <br>Host: Fair enough. Fair enough. Now, this is a question I get asked all the time because, you know, on the show, we've talked about reincarnation, about past lives, about near-death experiences, things like that. Many of these ideas are thousands and thousands and thousands—some of the oldest ideas, pre-religion, pre-organized religion, even. But people always have this one question like, "Why did we forget? Why is it necessary for us not to remember these quote-unquote past lives?" I always say, "You can barely deal with the life you have. Can you imagine having the memory of like four or five other lives with all the drama and pain and suffering? How do you think psychologically you could deal with it?" But I'd love to hear your point of view on it.  <br><br><br>Christian: So first of all, the forgetting is additive for a few reasons. Okay, one, if you want to fully experience being the human, you gotta be the human, man. You know, if you want to be Zelda, you gotta be Zelda. You can't be Contra-conscious in Zelda. There's no Contra in Zelda. There's just Zelda and Zelda, right? So if you want to be the human in your story, then you need to surrender and let go of everything else to be fully immersed in your human perspective. <br>That full immersion is precisely where the value is. So it actually adds perspective value when you can forget everything else and only have the perspective of being Alex or whoever is listening today. And then it's also additive because, like you said, you are basically free from—so okay, we do have qualities that we carry from life to life because we are the same soul from given life to life. But a given lifetime might develop certain attachments, form associations, and ego patterns. <br>And so it can be helpful to let that go. And like, the root fear, if it's unaddressed, we could remain from one experience to another. But let's say in one life, you really strongly associated with some conservative religious affiliation, and let's say you were a terrorist or something. If you live another life, that whole association is not even there anymore. It's gone. Like, you have no memory of that. Now you're still you, but now you get a fresh slate. Now you get to start completely over. You get to—you have to learn everything over again. All the language, all the patterns of life, everything your parents teach you, everything has to be relearned. But that's not just negative. It's like a new—it's like being given a brand new set of cards.  <br>Host: We are starting to level over again, but without any information about the game.  <br>Christian: Right! Well, you do—you actually, the soul, you do have some information. It's like starting a brand new game so that you can just play that game. And that is what playing that game is about. So I think that's the most concise way to put that. And the third reason is that being veiled protects us from homesickness because the depth of joy and love and freedom that we really are is, oh, my gosh, it's breathtakingly deep and vast and huge. <br>And to have recollection of that can be debilitating. Like, how are you going to get up and go to work in the morning if you knew, for instance, that the sun was in you right now? You could feel it. Like, I say that because of my pre-birth experience. I felt that. I knew the sun was in me. The sun is a part of me. I'm a part of it. I'm a part of the sun. Sounds wild from the human point of view, but from there, I could feel it. I just consciously feel it in my body. So imagine if you could feel that in the body of your awareness. How would you go and go to McDonald's and order your coffee? You know, you couldn't. <br>So in that sense, the veil is enabling. And then what's important is, if you imagine the veil like locking someone into a position, and then you work within that position, and you refine, and then when you let the veil off, now you expand back out because you did all this work at a limited place. Like, maybe if you wore a 100-pound coat, you put the coat on, now you got to walk around for a whole lifetime with this 100-pound coat. You learn how to walk with 100 pounds on you. And then when you take it off, "Ah, the 100 pounds aren't native to me." But you retain the ability to walk that you developed. You retain strength.  <br>Host: The strength and the skill that you have. Yeah, a lot of people have heard that analogy a lot of times, like it's a big, thick coat, and just like piled on and piled on and piled on. It's very dense, and it's hard to move. And it's that kind of world.<br>
Well, you obviously know firsthand, have experience of everything you just said, would be very difficult to deal with. How do you deal with the knowledge that you have in this physical experience?  <br>Christian: Yeah, so I don't consider myself special. Like I said, I'm still very much veiled. In my own walk, I really seek to fully accept the limitations that I experience and to meet fear if and when it arises. I've done a lot of that. In fact, this pre-birth memory could only return to me after I processed a lot of fear that I had—post-traumatic stress disorder time period after this trauma that occurred at 22, where I really healed a lot of that fear. That was very important for me to do. So, but it's too big to really even do in one lifetime. You know, it's a very deep process. <br>So I seek to allow whatever is in this moment, whatever that means, and to fully experience life here in whatever way I can. It is difficult to be this limited. You can be so, but also, I am the one who decides if it's difficult, you know? The limitations are just limitations. Sure, they may be so extreme, but I seek to allow them and to experience them. I know that sounds vague, perhaps, but that is what this life is, you know, for me. I do very much look forward to returning. I'm not saying I'm asking to pass. In fact, I'm very careful not to put energy in that direction. I don't want to inadvertently push myself in that direction. I want to fully use this life if I can, you know, every day. But when it's over, it will be wonderful.  <br>Host: So then, with the concept of past lives and that we do this again and again until we work on things, what is karma? And what is the idea of karma play into this? Because a lot of people think karma is like, you know, you hurt somebody now, you have to—it's a punishment, you have to deal with it in another life. From my understanding, from talking to different people, it's a choice to work it out. Like, if I harmed you in this life, Christian, and I do my life review, I'm like, "Man, that's something I got to really work on." You want to add that extra level of difficulty in the game the next time around so you can work through that, so you can continue your evolution. So it's a true choice as opposed to a punishment. Is that how you see it as well?  <br>Christian: Absolutely. Yeah, it's absolutely a choice. So karma is what we could just say cause and effect. Basically, you are who you are. That's the simplest way to put karma. You know, if you are a person who's relied on fear and ego and hurt others, then that's who you are. And so then when you get to the other side, and you see the effect you had on others, it's not that there's this like judgment, like, "Oh, you hurt this person. Next, you know, you see who you are." Like, you see very clearly, "Oh, I hurt that person because I have fear," they say, or "Because I have not yet integrated a certain kind of experience." You see who you are, and so then out of your own, it's your own choice to say, "You know, I'd really like to integrate that and grow through that because I see the benefit of doing that." And it's with you. There's like this energetic because you are who you are. Who you are remains with you until you deal with it. <br>So you might say, "Okay, so you know how we just were talking about how everything is happening in the one now? Okay, processing fear happens in the one now, too. So let's say that you had an experience when you were four years old, and you locked it away because it was so painful. Maybe you were sexually abused, maybe you were beaten, maybe it was just something simple, like somebody called you a name, and you locked—you really latched onto that and lost your sense of self-worth, whatever it is. The fear that is the rejection, the willingness to reject a certain feeling and not process it, is still there. If you allow in this moment that to arise, and you feel it now, at whatever age—27, 38, 91—doesn't matter, then you are meeting the same energy in the one now, even if it was something that seemed to have been too difficult or too big because we locked things away because they're too big. This fear is too big. This trauma is too big. I can't possibly look at that. <br>There's no way it's gonna destroy me if I look at it." That's how it feels. That's how it felt with my fear. My trauma that I experienced in China, I had post-traumatic stress. It was so deep, it was so terrible, I couldn't even look at it. I had dissociated from myself even to escape this fear that was so big, it felt like it would destroy me. Our fear will not destroy us. We are bigger. We are deeper. The consciousness is deeper than the deepest fear. But we need to be willing to allow it and feel it in this moment. And when we do it in this moment, you see that heals through all the moments. And then you don't have to experience it anymore, actually. <br>So you don't go into it because you're trying to get rid of it. You allow and accept it and fully feel it to heal it, feel it to process it. And when you do that, now you've done that within all the nows. You see, including the other lives that you may be living. You know, that very moment when you decide how you meet a difficult vibration is the key. It's very empowering. You know, we tend to get overwhelmed by, "Oh, mine, I have all these years of sludge. How do I deal with all that?" You just meet this moment. This moment has the power.  <br>It's very—that's a very powerful idea. Without question. I have to ask you this, though, because this is something that I get all the time as well. When you say, "Oh, you hurt somebody in this life," well, people will always bring up, "Well, how about Hitler? He murdered 6 million, 10 million people, or, you know, in war, or, you know, mass killers or whatever. These kinds of—there's just extreme versions of calling someone a name. Yeah, killing 9 million people."  <br>We draw a line somewhere in between those two things.<br>
There's a line, there's a line somewhere. I tend to—<br>
Right, in our mind. So you're like, you know, that's when the whole concept of hell and you have to be eternally damned comes in. Like, so what do you—can you explain to everybody how you process, as a soul, that you are Genghis Khan?  <br>Okay, so, yeah, yeah. So first of all, when you process from the other side, you see exactly who you are. And even their wisdom is not automatic. You still have to decide what you're going to do with it. If you caused huge amounts of damage, then that's the person that you were. You're capable of causing huge amounts of damage. You then will decide what to do with that. I think it's very important in the meantime to not draw a huge distinction between levels of fear. And I know that levels of scope, consequence, earthly consequence may vary significantly. <br>But there is not a very significant difference between my fear, your fear, or the fear in Adolf Hitler that led to his ego that killed millions of people. I know the scope may be extremely different, but fear is fear. And our own fear is what we're here to process, not Adolf Hitler's fear. Right? We need to meet our own fear. We're very quick to look at everybody else now—X times X, external world—and to judge and to quickly turn a blind eye to our own weakness, our own fear. That's what the ego does. "Don't look at that. Don't look at what your own issues are. <br>That's too hard. It's easier to look out here." We regain some power by judging or whatever else. But we're here to meet our own fear and to grow in love in our own way, even if it's very small. When we do that, even with a fear that may not have a huge scope on the outside, we are helping the collective consciousness of humanity to heal. You know, we're giving permission to everybody else in the pond to meet their fear. And that can very much heal the world, not only externally but in each of us, which is where it starts. You know, consciousness is first. The product of what it decides to do is second.  <br>So, from the perspective of the soul, someone like Genghis Khan—it's hard to say from this perspective of the human perspective—but someone like Genghis Khan, who murdered and hurt so many people in his lifetime, he—without him, those souls wouldn't have had the opportunity to experience what they experienced, is what you're trying to say.<br>
Well, for some, for some would have—for some who would have experienced some challenge that might have been beneficial for them in some way, shape. However, this is not about, "Oh, let's go cause some pain because it's beneficial."  <br>Please, yeah, please, everyone listening, please, at least on—we're not saying that.<br>
When we choose our contexts, we're loving beings. We're beings of love. That's what we are. And we seek to express and actualize that through even very difficult contexts. That's what we seek to do. Now, are we unconditionally loved, even if we kill a million people? We are. I'm not saying it's okay to kill a million people. We should not—that is not the way of love. That is not what we're called to do. But the true justice—we want justice. The ego says, "There must be justice. Show me the justice." The true justice is that even Hitler is loved. <br>It makes me emotional because we live in a world where so many people are hurt, and we just want to evoke vengeance on each other. I just watched a near-death experience on your channel—I'm sorry, I forget her name—she had been raped, and she decided, by her intuitive guidance, to not press charges. It was her decision against the person, and he found her later in life and said it ate him alive. And he ended up becoming a police officer and helping many other people to prevent that kind of circumstance because she had not gone ahead and brought the justice system down on him. You know, she made that system decision intuitively. I cried when I heard that because she tried to make the loving decision even though she was the victim. And our world just hurts for the even—even the perpetrators to be loved. Love is the answer. You know, that is the ultimate healing power. And when we get to the other side, we know it. Imagine how you feel if you knew you hurt 1000 people, and you're still loved. Imagine that.  <br><br><br>And it's a difficult minefield we're talking about because we're talking about two different very different perspectives: the spiritual perspective versus the physical perspective. And I know people listening to this might have difficulties hearing things like this. But I understand your point of view. I understand your point of view 100%. Look, Jesus said it. Buddha said it. I mean, there's so many spiritual masters who said, you know, "When you were the first—you know, who was without sin, throw the first stone," and things like that. Like, we all go through things, some more extreme than others.<br>
But let me just make one quick comment that I love. Love is love. Love is unconditional love. If there's a message that is less than that, it's not the ultimate truth. But meanwhile, unconditional love is also very wise. And the system of karma that exists is built within that wisdom. So there is not such a thing as—somewhat so—even though we are simultaneously completely unconditionally loved, even though that is true, we never escape who we are. There's not one thought, there's not one action that doesn't have its—I don't want to use the word justice, but its balance. It's balanced. We are fully responsible for every single thing we have done, everything. And so there, I'm just saying that that system of true balance takes place within and is fully transcended by unconditional love and unfathomable wisdom.  <br>My friend, I'm gonna ask you a few questions I ask all my guests. What is your definition of living a good life?<br>
Living a good life? Living a life that is in alignment with the love and peace and joy and freedom of our true nature in the physical.  <br>What is your definition of God?<br>
There are no words that can just ascribe God. The living, loving, conscious, sentient foundation of all being who knows us and the other ocean—we are drops in the mighty ocean of love. The Rumi quote, "You're not just a drop in the ocean. You are the mighty ocean in the drop." That's amazing. That's beautiful. And that ocean is what we would call God.  <br>And what is the ultimate purpose of life?<br>
Love. Love is the ultimate purpose of life. And it means so many things. Like, we tend to think love means the romantic love or the puppy dog love or the parent's love. Real life—love with a capital L—and all the things that can mean: living in joy and freedom and just doing it how we can, even here in this cold, airless Mount Everest context.  <br>And where can people find out more about you and the work that you're doing, sir?<br>
Yeah, so I have a website, awalkinthephysical.com. The book is available for free on the website through a link down. It's also on Amazon, and I also recorded the audible audiobook last December. And feel free to reach out to me by email. I get a lot of emails, so I apologize if I can't respond, but I do try to respond to everybody I can. It's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a>  <br>And do you have any final words for our audience?<br>
Yeah, the last thing I'll say is, whoever you are listening today, thank you for being human. And you are not just the human story. You are you—like, the you that feels like you to you, the free, total, full of life and love, authentic you is who you are. Please don't forget that. We get wrapped up in these deep, rich stories. I know it's very intense, like, you know, we gotta go to work and pay the bills and deal with the illnesses and deal with the relationships. I know it's rich, but who you are transcends all of that. And then who you really are, there is absolutely nothing to fear. That is just such an important message that we need to share with each other. That I mean—need to, but it's beneficial to share with each other.  <br>Christian, I appreciate you coming on the show and sharing your journey with us. And I hope this helps somebody out there listening right now. And thank you for your bravery and thank you for all the work you're doing for humanity as well, my friend. I appreciate you.<br>

 <br><br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi_NuEiYnxY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi_NuEiYnxY</a><br>18 JUN 2024<br><br><br>Hello Christian, thank you so much for being here. It's a real pleasure to have you as a guest on the podcast.  <br>So Christian, I've read your book entitled A Walk in the Physical, which I found so inspiring in terms of having an overview and a better understanding of the context and the implications of our incarnation here on Earth. I want to start this interview by asking you how it all came about in your life. Have you always been drawn to spirituality, or did you have an awakening happening at some point in your life?  <br>Yeah, I think both. I've always been drawn to spirituality, but in my early life, I was seeing the world through a Christian context, a Christian lens. My body is 43 right now, but at the age of 30, I went through an awakening process—not purely intentionally. I began to take up a long-term meditation practice, and after a few months, I started having non-physical experiences, out-of-body experiences, and I also had pre-birth memories return to me.  <br>These experiences were super eye-opening, and they completely changed my worldview. I really had to change how I saw reality itself. So now, it's very normal for me to have these experiences and to see the world as closer to what it really is, which is kind of like a virtual reality that we're experiencing here. We're not really human; we're actually spirit having the human experience. Spirit meaning consciousness itself. You're actually you having the experience of being a human, and I'm actually me having the experience of being a human. That's not necessarily synonymous.  <br>So yeah, ever since then, I've really grown a lot in that way and come to a new understanding.  <br>What were you looking for in the process when you started this meditation practice? Did something trigger the start of that, or were you in pursuit of something specific?  <br><br><br>Yeah, great question. So I was always a seeker. I always just wanted to understand, and I was really kicked down the path by the consciousness explorer Tom Campbell. He's a physicist and consciousness explorer who wrote the book My Big TOE—that's the name of his book. I watched one of his interviews, and it was very interesting to me, so I bought his book. In the book, he really recommended meditation as a form of investigation, as a form of personal investigation.  <br>So I started down the path of meditation at first just because it felt so good. It was very relieving and relaxing and life-giving, and it was beneficial. But soon enough, I really had that door open to the higher part of ourselves, the larger consciousness system, as Tom Campbell calls it. Once that happened, it was like, "My goodness, I just have to keep exploring here because there's a lot more going on than the human context."  <br>So I was always a seeker, but yeah, that's how it started for me. It was hearing his message. There was one video I watched of his where he made one comment that was very simple—just a simple comment—but it stung my ego. The comment was, "What you believe is not going to get you anywhere particularly important."  <br>I brushed it off, but then I felt this little nudge inside me, this little nudge from spirit that set me down this whole path. That little nudge was, "Why did that sting? Why did that sting your ego?" And I thought, "Oh yeah, why did that sting? There must be a reason." So just that very simple nudge started me to read his book and then begin the meditation process. From there, it was like a snowball rolling downhill.  <br>Why do you think it stung your ego, that whole concept of belief?  <br><br><br>Yeah, it stung my ego because, at the time, I believed that I was justified by faith, by belief. That's a main point of Christian theology—that through belief, you have attained something, you are someone because you believe. So him saying that the nature, the specific identification of the belief itself, wasn't the active ingredient and wasn't going to get you anywhere—I didn't like that because that meant it challenged everything that I believed at the time.  <br>Yeah, changing the whole conditioning, the whole framework.  <br>Yep, the whole framework. Yep, yeah, and that hurts. That's big work. It is big work, but what's interesting though is that I wanted to know more. I wanted to find the truth more than I wanted to be comfortable in my lifelong beliefs.  <br>You see, it's hard. The ego wants to hold on hard to what it believes because that's easy. It's protective; it's safe. To let go of that and actually admit that you don't know, and then actually go explore and find out how weak you actually feel, how much fear you actually have, and actually go see for real who you are, what you feel, what reality is—that takes a lot of courage and humility. But the rewards are more than worth it. It's just at the beginning, it's not obvious.  <br>No, it's not obvious. And I always say, saying yes to that spiritual path and that spiritual work is not easy. I think there's a lot of currents of spirituality today that are very pink and fluffy and all that, and actually, I think you need to be brave and courageous to face your own shadow. It's absolutely a commitment, and it's accepting to break a lot of parts of yourself and a lot of your beliefs and a lot of relationships as well.  <br>It's not an easy path, but I think the gifts are enormous and so rewarding.  <br>But yeah, no, exactly. It can be a destructive path. However, it's a destruction of that which you're not.  <br>Exactly. But you don't understand. Exactly. I know that sounds abstract to say it's a destruction of what you're not, but what I mean is what you truly are, which is total love and peace and joy and freedom. That's what you really are. That cannot be threatened. It's only that we lose ourselves in belief. We lose ourselves in form association. That means we associate with the contents of the physical life—the ideas, the thinking, the feelings, the body. And in that association, we think that's who we are.  <br>Our identity becomes tied up in it, so when the identity gets threatened, when the beliefs get threatened, we think that means we are threatened. No, not the real "I." The real "I" is not threatened—only the association with that which we're not.  <br>Do you think, when we are in those states of destruction, shedding, excavation—which can be quite dark and difficult—do you think the soul rejoices in those moments?  <br><br><br>Yes, ultimately, yes, because what we're here to do is expand toward love, in love. The evolution of spirit—we're here for the evolution of our being, which is synonymous with the growth of love and joy. So when we face our fear and own our crap and admit our weakness and challenge our beliefs and actually go find who we are, that is a fear-challenging process. It's a process of engaging our actual fear and working through it and overcoming it.  <br>That is synonymous with the expansion of love and joy because love is our true nature. Fear is always in association with something that we're not, but when we work through that and we really integrate that experience, that allows an incredible expansion of being. And the being lasts far past the end of the physical experience.  <br>So yes, very much. That's useful to who we really are. We could say it's useful to the soul, but I don't like to make it sound like the soul is something else or someone else. You are your soul, so it's actually you that grows as you face your crap and own your fear and find the love and the joy in your life. It's a beautiful process for sure.  <br>To go back to when you started meditation and you were in this whole process of discovery and just going further in that research of consciousness—you mentioned that you had pre-birth memories. How did that appear?  <br><br><br>Yeah, so it's hard to describe. So first, like I described, I started having out-of-body experiences, non-physical experiences. It really started with that. And then, as I got more and more in touch with who I really am, which is consciousness, my consciousness, the consciousness, then all of a sudden, my pre-birth arrangement was just very plain, very obvious. It was like somebody had just blown leaves off of the ground, and the memory was just there.  <br>It wasn't like earthly memory. It was very alive and ancient and current too—hard to describe. Like it's happening right now but also millions of years ago, kind of a feeling. And very full and rich and very personal—extremely personal, more personal feeling than any earthly memory actually. And it was just there, like so normal, like the most normal thing in the world.  <br>Yeah, very natural.  <br>Yeah, so when you talk about pre-birth memories, we're not talking about the womb. I have a pre-birth memory. I found out quite late what it was, but it's always been with me. It's a memory, but it's all like me in the womb. So obviously, there's no image; it's just sensation. It's just a feeling. You're just in the dark.  <br>But when you talk about your pre-birth memories, are you talking about in the womb or on the other side?  <br>The other side. Yeah, the other side—planning the incarnation. Yeah, planning the incarnation and then, after accepting the veil, being in the womb. But the majority of it, the much more meaningful and substantive portion, is pre-incarnation. Post-incarnation is very dense and limited.  <br>Yeah, nothing by comparison.  <br>Yeah, it's not comfortable. This body—no, no, not by comparison. We get used to it, but it's extremely dense and limiting.  <br>Yes, and so what's your outlook on what happens pre-incarnation? Do you decide what the plan is? Do you decide on your own, or do you decide with guides or other counselors?  <br><br><br>Yes, yeah, very much like that actually. So in my case, I had an intention to meet and integrate a certain fear because I knew that that fear would be like—if I could really process and integrate that and process the karma, I guess is the good English word—karma. It's the best word we have, the energetic history I had with that fear. I knew that that would be very beneficial for me and for the whole to process that fear.  <br>So the guides I worked with—my guides—there are very loving and wise beings who help us decide what would be optimal to do, what experience would be optimal to engage. And they brought me a previous life, which I rejected immediately after reincarnating while I was still in the womb because I was like, "I'm not doing this. This is not happening. It was so—this is too much. I've forgotten all that I am. I'm not doing this."  <br>And so I rejected that life, and that caused a miscarriage of that body. So that was a—you could say—a failed attempt. I don't like the word failure, but it was an attempt that didn't go far because I didn't even make it to physical birth. But then I still had the intention, so then they brought me this life, and I reviewed this life in great detail before accepting it.  <br>I asked some requests about it—quite a few requests about certain things I wanted to experience or aspects of the life I wanted to have included. And it was all kind of revolving around this one main theme, this one theme of this one certain kind of limitation that I would experience every day here, and that would give me the opportunity to reprocess this fear.  <br>So I did work with the guides for that and help—you could say—tweak the life. But there's some things you can't tweak. I mean, there's a lot that comes with a given life that is native to the life—like certain biological constraints, the family, of course, the mother and father and their nature and how they might affect you, and the society you grow up in. It's a very complex and rich context in which you're being incarnated and choosing to incarnate into.  <br>There is some room within that to make some tweaks, but there are certain elements that are just firm. So I don't know if that speaks to your question, but I did review that.  <br>Yeah, no, I agree with the fact that some things are, as you say, firm in terms of context—which country you're born in, who are your parents, education, things like that. But do you think it's the same with events throughout the life, or people you meet, and things like that? Kind of like if you just draw a kind of timeline of certain events?  <br><br><br>It's probabilistic. Okay, so what I mean is—in my pre-birth plan, I reviewed how this life would likely unfold, and I reviewed millions and millions and millions of possibilities all in a few seconds. And I could see—it was like branches of a tree. There were certain avenues that were very likely, certain avenues that were less likely.  <br>So what determines the avenue? What determines the branch? Choice-making—my choice-making and the choice-making of everybody else in the game. You know, it's free will. It's just you have to make choices within the context as is permitted by the context. So, you know, I can't choose to go to the moon right now, kind of thing. But I could choose to do many other things, and so can everybody else.  <br>And the system sees all that. It knows all that. It has all the data. It has all the information matrix—the matrix. Yeah, it has all the information, and it knows all the players in the game. So it's super good at predicting outcomes. That doesn't mean that it's prescripted, but it is pre-seen—what is likely and what is more likely and what is less likely.  <br>So if a life is built around a specific goal, it is very likely that goal will actualize—very likely—because the whole simulation, the whole world—I say simulation, I mean the physical world—it's just like a virtual reality. So the whole simulation exists for the purposes of the expansion of love and joy, which means the integration of experience.  <br>So if there's something that's beneficial for you to experience that you want to experience, that you choose to experience—even if it's hard—then the life will tend to give you that. The probabilities will tend to be nudged to give you that opportunity. So if there's a certain kind of challenge we come to experience, we often experience it over and over and over until we really meet it and face it.  <br>A little bit like that. It's we who get to decide how we respond to it, but why?  <br>So why do we, as souls—because I bet we're like super excited to come down, super excited—and then de-incarnation happens, we're born, and then you know difficulties, challenges, pain. Yes, life can be beautiful too, but life can be so difficult and so challenging. And what happens between those states? Why is it so extreme—being excited to come down here and then sometimes feeling like, "I can't, I actually can't do it"?  <br>And also, my question is linked to the fact that it's possible that some people don't succeed in their incarnation. So what's your answer to that?  <br><br><br>Well, there are two main questions there. The first is, why are we excited on the front end, and then when we get here, we can't handle it? So our true nature is completely immortal, and we are so free and full of power and love and joy. And we know it on that side. We can see it; we can feel it. It's the truth; it really is the truth.  <br>And so we know that we can't really fail. We can't truly fail. We know that we are beyond deeper than anything we might experience, even in this simulation. However, we are also pushing the boundaries because we're very creative. We're very powerful. We're parts of God, you could say. God is very ultimately powerful, so we're so powerful that we even have the ability, the choice, to see how far we can push the boundaries of the experience of separation.  <br>So here we are, experiencing separation very, very deeply. Yes, it's virtual; it's not fundamentally real, but heck, it's a real experience when you're here. It's pretty darn real. And we're really pushing the boundaries to see how deep can we go. Well, here we've come so deep that we really do feel separate, and the limitations of our lives feel so extreme.  <br>And then what happens is because those limitations are extreme, we react in fear because we put negative meaning on it, and then we respond in fear because now we've bought into some meaning that is not in alignment with the truth of who we are. So for instance, we might think, "Oh, the world has proven to me that I am powerless." That's one of the big ones on Earth. Lots of people feel powerless.  <br>Our true nature is not powerless; it's full of power. But when we buy into a perception of powerlessness, then we experience fear. Fear rises up because, "No, that's not me. I don't like that." And then the ego comes to the rescue and says, "Don't worry, I'll believe this thing that'll make me feel better. I'll do this thing that'll make me feel better." Whatever it can to just try to grasp at straws to fill this big hole that seems to have been made.  <br>But that whole process is an opportunity. That whole process is additive. You could say duality itself is like a tool that the soul uses for expansion. So we transcend the limitation, and we know it pre-incarnation. But then, when we actually commit into it, we find out, "Oh my goodness, I have a lot of fear." Fear just means yet unevolved-ness. It just means there are things I haven't really come to terms with or processed yet.  <br>And man, this is a place to do it. This is a high limitation set, high constraint set simulation. So yeah, there's a huge opportunity there.  <br>I want to go back to this whole idea behind the fact that we are spiritual beings incarnated in matter and density, and not material beings here. If you have a spiritual experience, correct? So what are we then? What's your view? Are we just pieces of consciousness? What is the goal of coming here for the soul? Does the soul or consciousness come here to evolve? Is that it?  <br>Yes, yes, that's true. So when we ask, "What are we really?" usually we're coming from the perspective of being form-conditioned. So what I mean is, we think that what's real is bodies, places, objects, up, down, left, right, light, darkness. Which one of these forms am I really?  <br>But it's difficult to speak to that because what we really are transcends and gives rise to all form. The best word we can use for that—I know it sounds abstract, so I'm trying to get more specific—the best word we can use for that is consciousness, or spirit, or awareness, or aliveness, or beingness, or life itself with a capital L.  <br>Those words are all kind of interchangeable because the thing we're trying to describe can't be described. I think the word consciousness is probably the best if we're trying to understand what we really are. We are conscious. We are that which knows, that which experiences.  <br>So that consciousness that you are and that I am is a little piece of the whole—the one, that thing that exists, which we could call God or source. So we are—you could say—I love the Rumi quote: "You are not just a drop in the ocean; you are the mighty ocean in the drop." That's what we are. We are pieces of the whole, and yet you are the whole.  <br>We're not actually separate from each other; we're just super creative. And we're so creative that we're actually seeing right now, "Can we feel separate from each other all the way? Let's see, can we do it? Can we lose ourselves in the dream?"  <br>So why do that? What's the benefit? Well, it's difficult to describe in language because the soul is so vast. You could even say curiosity alone would be a big enough reason. But what I want to focus on is what inspired me to come to the physical was that I came across a being who had been physical, and I could feel from him this absolutely incredible quality of nature.  <br>I don't know how to describe this—his essence, like his body of light. Okay, we could just put a metaphor on it—his body of light was full of so much amazing love and joy that was incredible. And I asked him, "How did you do that? How do you feel as much joy as I feel?" And he shared with me, "Yes," and I felt from him all that incredible depth of joy and this incredible power that he had.  <br>And I asked, "How could you possibly be this? What did you do to be this?" And he shared with me that he had experienced a very—well, many things—but one thing among them was he had experienced a physical life where he had a long-term health condition, a pain that lasted with him for years. And how he chose to meet the pain allowed a refinement of his being.  <br>He grew because it was like the circumstance was a counter-pressure. The circumstance was like a weight on a weight bench that he used. Now, it's not native to him. He let go; his body passed. You know, he died eventually, like we all do. It's fine; that's actually a really good thing because then it's like dropping the weight, taking off the heavy coat.  <br>But everything that you did while under the weight bench or while in the heavy coat, you get to keep all that. You keep who you really are, but now you've done it with a heavy coat on. So now you're stronger; now you're brighter in a way that you couldn't otherwise be.  <br>So it's the opportunity that the physical offers that makes it so alluring, so valuable. Now, once we're here, we can get overwhelmed because the weight can be really heavy, and we don't even know what that's like.  <br>That's one of the main names of the game—we don't know why we're here. We forget. That's like a main part of the game is we forget, and then we see how we do.  <br>Role number one, guys.  <br>Exactly. Role number one is you're not going to remember. Now, the thing is, you're still you. So I know that sounds like, "Well, if I don't remember, I'm not me." No, you're still you. You're still the big you; you just think you're the small you. You just think you're the little human. You're not.  <br>You know, when I was a kid, I was quite—I didn't grow up in a religious family or anything, but I was quite—I loved praying, and I was just really in my world. And I hated going to school because I thought kids were mean, and it was like a danger zone.  <br>And I would sometimes just—I knew this wasn't me, this personality thing. And I would sometimes just close my eyes really hard and go, "This is not who I am. This is not who I am." And I would reach a space of void, but I was like six or seven, and I was doing that. And that would freak me out, and I would be like, "No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just going too far."  <br>But it's funny, especially as a child, because you're so close to the source. So obviously, there are things you're less form-associated.  <br>Yeah, exactly. So it just stays. But I would do that—close my eyes and be like, "I know this isn't me." That void is a common experience. That void you describe is consciousness without—well, what Tom Campbell would say is it's consciousness without a data stream.  <br>So you've looked away from the physical. Imagine the physical is like a data stream, like maybe streaming a movie on your computer. And then you just look away; you're no longer looking at that data stream anymore. That's kind of what the void is. You're looking away from the data stream back towards consciousness itself.  <br>Now, it can be terrifying if you're really ego-associated because guess what? There's no ego there; there's no form there. So you have to drop all that. The void is very exposed, which can be very uncomfortable for people. But that's a very common thing, and it's nothing to be afraid of. Our true nature is wonderful. There's no reason to truly fear who we are.  <br>But I love that because I remember as a kid, I had some pre-birth memory up until the age of five, and then it left me. I forgot completely by the age of five or six. But when I was like two, three, four, I remembered choosing to come, and I knew that this was just a big simulation, and everyone's playing along. So I'm going to go ahead and play the game, but it seemed mighty strange to me that nobody remembered.  <br>What are we doing here? Yeah, I was the only one in this. It does feel a little like that. It still feels like that to some extent. But I feel like it's not for me. There's no question about why we decided to incarnate now in this specific time as a collective.  <br><br><br>This is a very special time, and this is what I wanted to talk to you about as well. There are just waves and waves of awakenings at the moment. Yes, and this is why I created the podcast because I had a brutal awakening four years ago, and I just did not understand what was going on.  <br>I wanted to make this podcast to have testimonies for people who would just lose someone or lose their job or just something would happen, and then they would—I don't know—just have psychic faculties coming up. And sometimes you think you're just insane, like you're absolutely gone crazy. And it's really hard, and a lot of people are waking up at the moment.  <br>Yes, how do you explain this ascension in terms of the brutality of it? It's everything's very quick, and it's like, "Well, there's no time, guys. Like, we need to crack on."  <br>Yes, no, I love that question so much, especially because I just intuitively sensed when we first connected and when we first started this call that you're on that mission, and it's awesome. Like, you're one of the people who has come to help with these waves of ascension, and it's awesome. And I honor your choice because that's so powerful.  <br>This is the real work. It's not easy. No, it's not easy. It's not easy. No, but that's just why I'm honoring your choice because I know that's not easy.  <br>So why is it so brutal? Okay, yeah, so in my pre-birth experience, I remember seeing and knowing that the awakening was just happening. It was just starting. Like, I was born in 1980, and that was like the very early timeline when awakening was just starting. But it was seen that it was going to ramp up, and it was going to be a part of my life.  <br>I was going to live during the awakening, which actually, by the way, made the life even more exciting because to be a human on Earth during the awakening—wow, that is high, crazy, cool stuff. I mean, that's like the coolest.  <br>But why is it so hard? Because we have thousands and thousands of years of fear—collective fear patterns that are in our consciousness that we need to work through. Because as we evolve, as we wake up, the temperature of the water is rising. That means our vibration is increasing towards love more and more.  <br>We think it's slow, but it's actually very fast because simply because of the density we're dealing with here. We're dealing with huge amounts of fear-based thought patterns and beliefs—thousands of years of us versus them thinking. We live in a predatory world where we eat the bodies of other creatures to survive, and here we're trying to grow.  <br>So there's such density to that fear that as we process it, it has to come up to the surface to be felt. It has to come up to the surface to be seen. The old patterns of bloodshed and war—they're not the future; they're not what we are. But yet, that has to come up to be seen and to be processed and to be integrated.  <br>Just like when we process our own fear—which is where all the work happens, by the way—we don't need to worry so much about the whole world. We just process our own crap. We are really doing our part, and that means going down and actually experiencing the darkness that's in there—the shadow, the pain—and not rejecting it.  <br>Allowing it, honoring ourselves enough to actually let that come up and face it and realize, "Oh my gosh, I have so much fear. Oh my gosh, I'm a mess." That's okay. That's okay because it's by seeing that and allowing it and feeling through it that you heal it, you integrate it, and then the light is what's left.  <br>It purifies it; it strengthens, and then the whole collective actually is raised up. And you give permission to everybody else to process their crap. You see, the solution is not in the organizations of the world to start. It's not in the governments or in the armies. No, the healing and the growth of humankind is in the heart.  <br>It's in the individual; it's in your consciousness. Just meet your own fear and find love and peace and joy in your own life, even in a small way, and you are helping the entire collective to grow and to rise up in that temperature, to process that old crap out, and to awaken.  <br>And as we do that, then the old systems will crumble. And we may think that, "Oh man, a year is a long time. Five years is a long time." Not really. One lifetime is a pretty short time. Now, we want change quick. We want to see quick change. Change is happening quick.  <br>I'm just encouraging—don't be discouraged if it appears to take a long time. We're dealing with a lot of density here, and there is growth occurring.  <br>When so I'm energetically sensitive, when I go out into crowds or even just meet with somebody, I feel their energy. I feel the energy of the crowd, and the energy now is so different than even 13 years ago when I started going through my awakening. There's so much more awareness and presence and love, even though there's also a lot of turmoil on the surface.  <br><br><br>Yeah, for sure. How do you explain this acceleration that we've had over the past few years in terms of the exterior world collectively—of wars, pandemic, like everything is just in shambles—and at the same time, more and more people awakening? What's causing this frequency to shake?  <br>The awakening causes friction because that means we have to process our crap and get it up to the surface, and that's going to cause friction and change. It's not just like a calm, gradual, gentle process. When the crap that's down there is gross—what I mean is when our fear is gross and dark—then when it comes up, that's going to be hard.  <br>It's going to cause friction—personally and collectively, energetically and physically. So as the awakening increases, there is more and more energetic calling. The world of consciousness precedes the world of form. It gives rise to it, so the world of form has to reflect the world of consciousness. It has to; it has no choice.  <br>There is no world of form; it's only consciousness having an experience. So as consciousness awakens, the world of form must reflect that awakening process. And in our case, that can be tumultuous.  <br>Yeah, and I think the Earth is actually shaking everything at the moment. And it's like, "This is now." Yes, man, sister. Oh my, yes. Yeah, this is something I'm feeling.  <br>And to go back to when we were talking about being kids—when I was a kid, I had that feeling. I was just praying in my room with my teddy bears and my little things, and I had a feeling that I had a mission. Yes, but not in the sense of a holy mission. It was more of like there's something that I need to do—a personal mission.  <br>Yeah, there is something here that I need to do. But I was freaked out because I didn't know what it was. I didn't remember it. Yeah, and I'm saying this—I was maybe five, six, seven, like that age.  <br>And when I had my awakening, I could see everything happening in the world, and I was like, "Oh, this is the moment. This is the kind of like—I don't know—it's just like when you remember a dream, but you just remember one or two details, and it's like, 'Oh, I recognize this. I recognize this frequency.'"  <br><br><br>Yeah, but I think it's great. A lot of people are awakening, and it's all happening, and it's great. And I think that's why I loved your book as well. It's just because sometimes it can be so destroying and difficult, and I think people like you publishing books like you did really help have an overview of, "This is just theater. This is just a play, and there's nothing to be afraid of in it."  <br>No, exactly. And you knew what costume you were going to put on, and you knew exactly what was going to be on stage and what the script was.  <br>So yeah, thank you so much for your book because I think it is one of those books that is just full of wisdom. It made me think of Conversations with God as well. I love those books where you can just open any page, and there's a message for you now, what you're going through, and you can just open it at any page, and there's a reading, something that's beautiful.  <br>That's what it's meant for, so thank you so much.  <br>Yeah, but what's the response to your book being published? Do you get people saying, "This has helped"?  <br>Yeah, it's been overwhelmingly positive. I'm so—as I wrote the book, okay, I never sat down and said, "I'm going to write a book now." It was always that spirit was coming to me and guiding me with chunks, providing chunks, and all I did was record it over six years and then intuitively arrange it.  <br>It's a nonlinear book on purpose because it's meant to provide what you've described—helping the reader get to that piece that will help them today, that will remind them of who they are. It's all about reminding us of who we really are because when we know that, we don't have to be afraid.  <br>So yes, to your question, many people have reached out. I've made the book available on my website to be read online for free. It's not about money; I just want the message to get out. And yet, it has also sold many copies. I've done the audiobook, and that's done very well.  <br>The reception has been so wide-reaching that it's just shocking to me. When I published it, I knew—just like you were saying—you kind of recognized, "Oh, I have a mission here. I have something to do here." Oh man, I felt that calling with this book so strongly. My bones were like, "You must do this before you pass."  <br>I can't even describe to you the level of spiritual—I don't know what the right word is—compulsion? Maybe that's a wrong word. I just felt so strongly called. There's like a drive to it. Oh, drive. Like I had to do that.  <br>And when I finally published it, I was—I don't even—nothing. I don't need anything to happen with it. I don't have any idea as to an outcome. However, I also have intuitively known this could really affect the world. This could really help.  <br>And when I pressed publish, I just felt that release. And since then, yeah, I get emails every day from people. It's very humbling; it's very touching. I have one-on-ones with people from around the world, and there are so many spiritually awakening people that just want to find, "Oh my gosh, I'm not crazy. This is real. I really want to share with somebody."  <br>And we need to be there for each other. You know, we're all brothers and sisters. There's no such thing as strangers. We're all connected; we're all one with each other. And it's so exciting to be here on Earth at this time.  <br>So I'm honored if even one person can be reminded of who we really are. I will feel so much joy because that's a huge opportunity here.  <br>There's a great quote by the guide Silver Birch that I can't remember exactly. Silver Birch is a channeled source back in the 1940s—some of the most beautiful writing on spirituality that exists. So beautiful. And he has a sentence where he says something like, "You know, all the darkness can be driven from the Earth. It's not a picture of gloom. If you can help even one soul to be comforted when all seems dark or to remind them of who they really are, then it will have all been worthwhile. And you can help far more than one."  <br>Oh, I'm so moved by that and motivated by that because we really can help each other. Just like in the store, you know, it doesn't need to be a big, grand thing. Just smile to the person next to you. Just ask them how their day is today. Just give somebody a hug. Be vulnerable with somebody.  <br>Show somebody we're not the masks. We live in a world of masks, but man, screw the masks. Forgive my—as we say in English—forgive my French. That's how we—yeah, yeah. I love saying that when I start in English—forgive the French. So I just mean, screw the masks. That's not who we are.  <br>We are who we really are. You are who you really feel. Who we are—you are your true nature. We don't have to wear a mask with each other. And that has been the greatest blessing because now that I've published the book, people reach out to me, and they drop their masks, and we can be real with each other.  <br>That's what it's all about, man. If we can do that on Earth, oh, it's beautiful.  <br>It is beautiful. But I think this is what's happening now. And as you said, I think our greatest strength is writing, publishing, doing videos, doing podcasts with testimonies of people's spiritual paths or difficulties or how they overcame it and what was the gift after that because I think anyone can relate.  <br>And the thing is, in my podcast, I interviewed a lot of people who are in their 60s or 70s or 80s, and when they described to me their spiritual awakening when they were around 20 or 30, it just sounds really tough.  <br>And bear in mind, most of the people that I interview are scientists, doctors, pharmacists. And basically, there's one woman who said to me—she had kids, and she was married, and she had this big spiritual awakening, got divorced, went to Brazil or I don't know where, and everyone thought she was crazy.  <br>The father of her kids thought she was crazy; her colleagues thought she was crazy. And I think, you know, thank you to those people who actually carved the way for us because now we're so free to publish the book that you did or for me to do this podcast and just to talk about it freely.  <br>We're much more free than we used to be. However, there are many people who do not yet still feel free. There's a lot of people who are deeply associated with certain creeds, certain religious associations, societal restrictions, or cultural restrictions, and they don't feel free.  <br>And one of the most important things we can do is to remind each other, "It's okay. You're allowed to question. You're allowed to grow. You're allowed to go see what's real. You're allowed to find yourself, and you're allowed to be yourself."  <br>Do you know that? Like, it sounds simple, but our whole society is built on—well, not our whole society, but huge portions of our society are built on the fake, built on the beliefs, built on the old way of thinking.  <br>We are creating a new world, and anytime we can be there for each other, it's like another ping in the collective consciousness, and that helps accelerate things. It's beautiful. It's such wonderful work.  <br>Yeah, I think it's great. More people awakening, and then that means more and more and more. And you know, there's this big movement happening. We're really lucky.  <br>And there's one concept I wanted to talk to you about before we end this interview—something I'm personally really working on right now in my personal life. It's love. Love when something doesn't go your way. Love when someone hurts you. Love when you're actually angry and want to kill someone.  <br>And there's one—it's just lyrics of a song. I don't know if you know this English rapper called Little Simz. Only vaguely? Okay, so I'll just read you there's this song called "Broken" that she's written, and she says:  <br>"We all go through our hardships, but no life books show knees to the carpet and pray. You're being guided by a force, so you can't sink. Look how far you've come, and see you've only just started. You exist; you're alive; you're deserving of life. You're a beacon of light; you are determined to fly. You have a journal inside; you have the power to write. You have the opportunity every day to decide—choose love. It might just blossom into a new love, but whatever happens, just know that you've won. Amen."  <br>And I think those lyrics are beautiful because they just sum up—choose love; you've won. Yes, but that's something that really comes across strongly in your book. And yet, I feel like it's so difficult sometimes.  <br>Yes, do you have a piece of advice?  <br><br><br>Yeah, okay, this is a complex topic because it's the very thing that we're here to do. So it's very multifaceted; it's very unique for each person and how they deal with their internal and external world. It's a very rich topic, but I'll just make a couple of comments.  <br>So when we say choose love, that doesn't mean force some kind of fake love on top of your actual anger. At the root of everything, at the bottom of everything, is love. What I mean is, the nature of beingness itself is love and joy and freedom.  <br>So when we're not experiencing that, the first step is to acknowledge we're not experiencing that fully because we're not making anything up. This is not about making anything up; in fact, this is about getting rid of the things that we're making up and actually going and finding, "How do I feel? What do I feel? Angry? Why do I feel angry? Do I feel powerless? Why do I feel powerless?"  <br>Be willing to actually feel what you feel and then let it show you where the fear is because anytime we're experiencing anger or powerlessness or some kind of friction like that, underneath all the layers, underneath all the stories—it might be 300 layers down—but underneath everything, somewhere, is fear.  <br>If we can allow ourselves to see that fear and actually go into it—go into the dark closet and find out there are no monsters in there. When we go into the fear and actually experience it, actually allow it, actually bring the light of our awareness into it—not as a rejection, not so that we can get rid of it—no, go see how you actually feel when you actually are brave enough to process that.  <br>Feel it in your body. Your body is like a tuning fork or something; it will tell you how you're feeling. We feel our anxiety in our body; we feel our anger in our body; we feel pain in our body. Our bodily experience is part of the magic of this physical experience.  <br>Allow yourself to feel the body, feel the negative, feel that fear. And when you allow yourself to actually meet it and feel it all the way—yes, you might cry; yes, you might have other strong feelings rise up—yes, that's fine. Allow yourself to actually go and experience it all the way because that's taking the block out of the dam.  <br>It allows life to flow freely through you, and when we truly do that, all of a sudden, the fear that gave rise to the ego and to the anger and to the powerlessness will vanish—not because we tried to get rid of it, but because we were brave enough to actually go and see and feel.  <br>We were humble enough to actually acknowledge where we have fear. You see, underneath all of that is always, at the very bottom, love and peace and joy. Now, it's okay if we don't feel love and peace and joy. That's an important first step.  <br>We say, "Oh my gosh, I'm really pissed," or "Oh my gosh, I feel terrible right now. Why do I feel so terrible? That person made me feel bad, or this job makes me feel a certain way, and I feel powerless. Like, I don't have a choice to leave my job."  <br>Okay, so how do I feel that way? And you really explore underneath there. Be willing to actually explore. You will find your own rejection, your own labels, your own meaning is always a part of the mix. You are the author of the meaning; you are the author of the experience. You get to decide how you meet all that.  <br>So I know that's a broad comment, but that's really important because as we do that, we don't even know we're untangling the spider web. We don't think of it that way, but by untangling it and by untangling the ego, we get closer and closer to who we really are.  <br>It's like when we meet someone in the non-physical and we communicate with them, we share with them, we telepathically talk with them—our communication is not like here on Earth. Here on Earth, we're like, "Okay, I went to this place at this time, and this person did this thing, and this object got moved over here, and that object got moved over there, and now I'm angry."  <br>Now, when we share in the non-physical, it is a full sharing of how we actually feel, what our actual intention is, what our actual perspective is. They're a part of us; we're a part of them. We can feel it. There's no room for misunderstanding, and who you actually are, what you're actually feeling, is honored.  <br>You see, it's valued. This world doesn't do a good job in general of honoring how we actually feel and what our limitations actually are.  <br>So I know that was kind of a long comment there, but I just want to highlight that because it's okay to feel the way that you feel. If there's friction, just know that wherever your rejection is, wherever the negative meaning you've put on life is, it's okay that it's there.  <br>Now, one other quick comment—when you go down and do that exploration, if when you find the deepest fears, the deepest rejections, they will not appear to be beliefs. They will appear to be the nature of reality itself.  <br>For instance, "The world is cruel." You might believe that the world is cruel; it's full of bad people. "I have to protect myself. That's just the way it is." No, that's not just the way it is. That's a belief, but it doesn't appear to be a belief.  <br>So the reason I'm pointing that out is you need to be willing to question even your deepest assumptions and see where have you put negative meaning on your life because you are the author. That takes ownership; it takes humility, but it's ultimately extremely freeing.  <br>You see, because like I said, underneath all those illusions, peace and love and joy is who we really are. So if you're not feeling that, follow the signpost of what feels bad. Where does my body feel stressed? Why do I feel that?  <br>And then, if you follow that, your mind might show you an image of when you were five years old and somebody pissed you off. That's fine. And then, when you feel that now, you feel angry about something else, and maybe now I feel powerless.  <br>It's a big web; it's all connected. That's okay. Allow those things to arise, and then when they leave, that's okay too. Allow the peace that arises. Allow this moment to be good.  <br>You know, it's not like we have to go looking for the pain. Our pain will rise up on its own. Our fear will rise up all on its own. You don't need to go looking for trouble.  <br>This moment, when we stop all that and just appreciate—we're allowed to fully appreciate this moment as a moment of joy, as a moment of peace, as a moment of beauty. And it's okay if it doesn't feel like that at this moment, but when you let go of everything, it will because that's its nature.  <br><br><br>Do you think meditation is the key, or is meditation the only key to go inside ourselves like that?  <br>Well, it's not the only key, but it is a very powerful tool because it is setting aside time to actually investigate what is real, which is your consciousness itself, and not the thoughts.  <br>Because we get really deeply associated with thought—the word "associated" is really important because we're not the thought. You're not the thought; you're not your thoughts; you're not your body; you're not your feelings. Actually, you're you experiencing being those things.  <br>It's association with those things that get so deep. Meditation allows us to take a step back and gradually—well, it doesn't have to be gradual; it can be very immediate and sudden too—but usually, gradually step back towards what we really are.  <br>Then all of a sudden, it might take months even, but all of a sudden, this peace will just rise up. "Oh my gosh, what was that? It's so beautiful." And then the ego wants to grab onto it. "Give me that peace. That felt so good. Give me that again. I want that again."  <br>That desperation quickly comes to the surface because, "Oh my gosh, that felt so amazing—even to have one second of freedom from thinking and from association, just being me all the way, alert me, felt so good. Give me that back."  <br>Just going and doing that does create so much space. So meditation is very helpful. But is it the only method? No.  <br>We could just say—because this is another broad question—but we could just say that the way that we choose to meet reality is very powerful. So I love the quote from Bashar: "Circumstances don't matter; only state of being matters."  <br>And what he means is, it doesn't really matter what's arisen on the surface so much. It doesn't really matter if you have money or don't have money. It doesn't really matter if your body is sick or well so much. What matters is how you relate to it, how you use or respond to the circumstances.  <br>Doing that mindfully—which is again back in the direction of meditation—but mindfulness doesn't require meditation. It can be practiced in any moment. Doing that mindfully can be very freeing because as we have mindfulness—that means full alertness—then when the circumstances arise, we can identify, "Oh, you know what? I really have a death grip on this idea."  <br>Like, in my case right now, I'm in a situation where my job, my workplace, is making a significant change that I don't prefer. And so now I'm having to make a decision—do I stay there? Do I move on? Do I stop working for a while to continue to focus on this work?  <br>I have to decide, so my thinking has been focused on that topic for like two weeks. So when I meditated last night, I felt all this association of my consciousness with these thoughts that seem so important. "How do I earn money? That seems really important. Do I give up this thing that I've been working so hard for? That seems really important."  <br>It's okay to let that go actually and to return—it's actually empowering then to return to who we are. That's meditation. But then, once we're here, what quality of being do I bring into this moment? This decision?  <br>If somebody says something at work, who am I in that moment? Do I get lost in the unconscious ego response, or can I arrive with a state of being that is more intentional, more alert? That simple process is very powerful.  <br>It is a simple process. Well, I think what's hard is applying it every day and seeing the little things and how we react. You have that kind of posture all the time. I think that's what's—yeah, that's a good question.  <br>Just a quick comment about that—that posture may start as a forced habit. Like, what I mean is, "Oh, this came up. Okay, now I'm going to try to look at this differently. Man, I'm pissed. I'm going to try to look at this differently."  <br>And now this came up. "Oh, man, this sucks." So that's okay. Like, that's okay. I want to point one thing out though—your true nature is effortless. Your true nature is authentic. Your true nature is joy. So it's not hard.  <br>All I mean is, it's not hard to be who you really are. It's easier than breathing. Being who you really are—does that sound like such a hard habit? No.  <br>Put it this way—I know that in practice, it can be challenging. I'm not trying to make it sound overly easy. In fact, this place—this is the place of great rigor and challenge. We're really pushing the boundaries. I mean, this is hard.  <br>That's the opportunity. The opportunity is, can you be kind even when you're cold and hungry and mad? Or can you be kind even when your intimate partner just totally trashed your trust or whatever?  <br>You know, whatever the situation—it's one thing to be on the other side and to know our true nature and to say, "Yes, I can be kind. I'm kind." It's another thing to be here and to just have had mud thrown in your face metaphorically, and now, what choice do you make?  <br>You see, but if we can see the mud as an opportunity and go, "Oh my gosh, this mud—this is gross. This sucks. It's in my eyes." And you know what I mean—you scoop out your eyes, and you're like, "What is going on?"  <br>If you can even just have that little bit of humor and then decide how to respond, that goes a long way. It takes alertness, and it evolves who you are without even knowing.  <br>You see, it's all about quality of intention. It's not really so much about how the physical objects end up being arranged. It's just, what intention do you bring into this moment? Are you bringing in intention that's rooted in fear and ego, or love and ease and authenticity?  <br>That's all. And I know that can be difficult to apply daily when you're being whipped by life. Still, that's the opportunity. That is the very opportunity. It's like a gift.  <br>The challenges of life are like a gift being handed to you because how else can the immortal being be so challenged? So when they're handed to you, then you get to make the choice—what do I do with this moment? Wow, what an honor. What a gift.  <br><br><br>Yeah, and I think this is exactly what our free will is. Yes, exactly. How do you react because things happen to you—situations, good, bad, whatever. How do you react?  <br>And the thing is, I think it's so deep what you just said about intention because when someone threw mud in my face 10 years ago when I was 25, I would be so angry. I would just blast on the other person. That would be my reaction.  <br>And today, when the same thing happens, I'm really angry, but I don't do anything about it. I don't speak. You see what I mean? I make a choice, and that's more conscious.  <br>It's like, "Okay, I'm super angry. He better not call me right now because this is going to be a massacre." And then, once the anger comes down, it's like, "What's my intention? How do I want to not solve this but find a peace of mind?"  <br>And I think that's the intention. It's like, "No, I've got this anger, and I've got all that, but what do I do with it? Where do I want to take it? Where do I want to go with it?"  <br>And I think you've just made me realize that actually, it's just a matter of intention because before, I was like, "Well, this is my reaction. It just means it's my reaction. I can't do anything against it." But it's actually two separate steps—this is the reaction, and where do I take it? What do I do with it? How do I transcend it?  <br><br><br>Yes, that quality of intention is very deep, and often, we can't even fully identify at the start what our real intention is. We just know we're angry. We just know that we're upset. We just know we feel a certain way.  <br>Really, our intention might be, "I feel afraid of being alone or powerless, and so I'm going to grab any power I can by throwing anger back immediately." You know, our intention is to protect ourselves.  <br>We don't even know that that's our intention; we just know we feel angry. But one really important point I want to make here though is, it's not just like you choose. It's not like you just choose a nice intention, and now you've done your job.  <br>No, no, your true nature is love and joy. So when you actually choose the intention that is aligned with love—which means honoring yourself and honoring the world and honoring everyone around you and not throwing mud back at them—you know, when you really explore that, two things happen.  <br>One, you become freed. You become full of joy because guess what? Love is joyful. Fear is not. Fear sucks. Fear is all that negative crap that comes out of fear. When you act in love, your life will become joyful. Even this moment can become joyful.  <br>You can just laugh all of a sudden. You don't even know why because, "Oh my gosh, this isn't as dire as it seems." And then, when you make that choice—because it is your choice—it's all like you said, it's all this is what free will is all about.  <br>What intention do we choose to wield? What intention are we issuing, whether consciously or unconsciously? When we make a shift in intention, the world changes too.  <br>Now, I know that might not seem obvious at first, but this is still a probabilistic reality. It has no choice but to respond to you. So as you change your intention, other things will happen in your life that wouldn't have otherwise happened.  <br>Certain events may or may not happen. Like, you know, some event might arise that might have otherwise not arisen, or vice versa. Or you might meet someone new that otherwise wouldn't have been energetically attracted into your space.  <br>That intention precedes how the probabilities unfold in the physical. So I'm introducing a little bit of magic here. The world is not just an objective, physical, dense, "screw you" place. The world is still a virtual reality that has no choice but to arise in response to intention probabilistically.  <br>So to put all that very simply, magic happens when you change when your quality of intention shifts from fear to love. Magic happens. The universe succeeds when you do that, and it provides—like, there are two elements to this.  <br>One is that it just mechanically happens like a mechanism. The universe has no choice but to just respond. But also, the universe tends to feed back to you the positive when you're on the right path. Whereas when you're on the wrong path—when you're on a path of selfishness or you're just constantly avoiding some fear—you tend to have a negative experience.  <br>It tends to keep coming up over and over until you face it and process that crap. Yeah, it's like you have not done your homework, and it's just—it is like that. But it's more like, "Okay, another opportunity. Okay, another opportunity."  <br>And we think, "Oh, I should have mastered this 10 opportunities ago." You know what? It's okay. The patience of spirit is infinite. Like, the unconditional love of spirit—unconditional love, absolutely unconditional.  <br>No conditions means one million failures later—no, it's not really failures—one million reminders later, you will still be loved, and you'll still be given the chance. And then, if you choose love—oh, beautiful. One million times later, it doesn't matter how long. You're fine. It's okay.  <br>Like, you can't actually fail. It's very freeing when we realize how much that love is, how deep it is, how much absolute understanding there is for us. It's like—it's a little bit like if someone goes to Mount Everest and climbs the mountain, and maybe they only make it halfway up, and then they get really cold, and they can't breathe, and they get sick, and they break their leg or something, and then they come back.  <br>Do you say to them, "Oh, you screwed up"? No. You honor them because, "Oh my gosh, you went up into the cold. You went to where there was no air. Wow, that was kind of crazy. I can't believe you did that, but you did. Was it an adventure? How did it feel?"  <br>That's what being human is like, man. We're up on Mount Everest. It's cold, and then people are up here, and they're like, "Man, it's cold." Yes, it's cold. It's cold. It's fine.  <br>Now, the question is, what do you do now that it's cold? Do you take another step? Do you sit on the mountain and admire the sun for a bit? You know, that's all that matters. It doesn't matter that it's cold or airless. The cold and the airlessness—that is not native. It's virtual. It's an offering to us.  <br>So the question is just, how do we use it?  <br>I think that's a great way to end this interview with this question—how do we use it? What do we do with all that?  <br>Thank you so much, Christian.  <br>You're welcome. Thank you so much for having me on. Like I said earlier in the interview, the sense that I have about your mission is powerful. You really are doing it. Thank you for being here and walking the walk. If there's any way I can help, I would love to help.  <br>You're doing it. You're connecting the dots. It's awesome. Keep doing it.  <br>It was a real pleasure to speak with you and to have this opportunity to interview you. Thank you.  <br>Thank you.  ]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2024/34-christian-sundberg-memoires-de-pre-incarnation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2024/34 CHRISTIAN SUNDBERG - MEMOIRES DE PRE-INCARNATION.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:05:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[<strong>A Deeper Look at Existence with Christian Sundberg</strong>]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>3 OCT 2024<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip5tKBbkvfI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip5tKBbkvfI</a><br>The connection of spirit is rejuvenated. What I find draining is you could think of it like vibrational resonance in simple terms because I have to resonate down into the mean vibration, meaning the average or the middle, the median vibration of a place or a group or a company or whatever, in order to really be there and interact. At least that's been my experience, and that can be draining for me because I'm energetically sensitive and because I really feel everything and I really am processing it all. So there can be a challenge there. But now returning to the connectedness is wonderful and peaceful and life-giving. You know, when I do a session with someone or even when I do a talk like this, I feel rejuvenated. I feel strengthened by it.<br><br><br>Hello and welcome to Get Yourself Optimized. I'm your host, Stefan Spencer. It is my pleasure to have Christian Sundberg with us. When Christian was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While that memory left him completely for his early adult life, it spontaneously returned 12 years ago as Christian took up a meditation practice and went through a personal awakening journey. He also began to have out-of-body experiences. Christian now often speaks publicly as he seeks to remind others of a small part of who we are beneath that human play. Professionally, Christian has worked for 16 years as a project manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing projects. Christian is the author of the book A Walk in the Physical, which attempts to subtly describe the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey.<br>Christian, it's so great to have you on the show.<br>
Thank you, Stefan. It's wonderful to be here.  <br>Yeah, so first of all, I'd love to have you share your origin story of how you came to realize you were different from most people and how that affected your life.  <br>Sure. Well, we're all different. We're all very different and unique. But yeah, so when I was a small child, I had pre-birth awareness. I remember choosing this life and why, and then that memory left me completely by the age of five or six. It returned spontaneously at the age of 30. So I'm not going to share that experience in detail. I've shared it many times, but you know, since that experience and since the out-of-body experiences I had starting around the same time and over the last 13 years, I just see the world differently than probably the average person. I'm aware that this is an experience we're having. This is an experience that's occurring within consciousness, within what we really are. We're not really human, actually. We're just having the human experience and through it, integrating this experience and learning and growing and becoming more, working our way, you could say, towards love, using the contrast of the human condition for the expansion of love and the working past of fear. So that's super high level, but yeah, I see the world in that way, and I'm aware on a daily basis that we're not just the humans. We're actually much bigger.<br>Yeah, so what happened when you were age five or six, and that memory left you? Was it a certain moment or certain event that coincided with the loss of that memory, or was there just a gradual kind of slipping away of that memory? What happened?  <br><br><br>Yeah, it's more the latter because the veil, so that means the constraints we agree to accept and wear while we are human, the veil functions in such a way that our larger nature is obscured. And then the more we focus into the physical, the more we get of the physical. So you know, as I aged, I learned all the conditioning of a young child—my name and who I was and what I was supposed to do and not supposed to do. And the more we focus on that story and learn that and associate into that, that deepens the veil, you could say. So that was just a gradual process. I think it's very natural. I think everyone actually is closer vibrationally in consciousness to the other side at the very beginning of life because we haven't become so form-associated. But as we grow in form association, it's quite normal here to completely forget, at the conscious human level, what we really are. That's just part of the game, actually.<br>Yeah, so who are we, and who are you, and how does that show up in your daily life?  <br>Yeah, who we really are is vastly beyond language. It can't be spoken of because it's spirit. It's consciousness, awareness itself, beingness, life with a capital L. And that, whatever that is, that consciousness, it fully transcends all form, all language, all distinction, all description, all duality, actually. So you know, we can't take a word or two or five or 100 and successfully describe consciousness, but that's what we are. But metaphorically, to use some metaphors, we could say that each one of us is like a drop in the great ocean of all that is, or more specifically, a drop in the ocean of source, what we very crudely call God. That is the great I Am, that is the root of all things. We are each a drop in that ocean, and we could say that each drop is a soul. Soul just meaning an individuated consciousness. I like the term that Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer, uses. He uses the term "individuated unit of consciousness" (IUC) for the soul. I like that. It's accurate. We are individuated beings, but yet simultaneously one with the whole. See, that's really important because here on Earth, we've come really deeply into the experience of separation. And as we feel distinct, completely separate from each other and from the environment, we think, "I'm just me. I'm just in this body. This body is all I am." We don't feel consciously on a day-to-day basis that we're actually one with everyone else and everything else. In higher systems, that knowing is quite normal—to sense that others are a part of us and we are a part of them, and the environment is a part of us. So yeah, in short, we are each souls, and the soul has many, many different experiences and many unique qualities. And so we're each very, very unique, even though we've all come here and kind of met in this place on Earth, having this human experience at this time.<br>So do you remember past lives? Do you remember, for example, that we've met before or that you feel any sense of connection with me?  <br>I feel connection with you. I feel connection with many because, especially those who are of clearer awareness, you know, as the form association is not as firm, it's easier to feel the living connection. But anyway, yes, to your question, I have some brief memories of other physical experiences. I've had some snippets, some details. They're not other people, you know. It was just me doing other things, being other people, same me, same I. So I'm aware of that. But sometimes I got curious and tried to go down that path, and I can feel this gentle nudge like, "No, you don't need to go there right now." And that's fine. You know, I'm doing this thing now, this human experience now, so I try to stay rooted in just this character at the moment. But yeah, I'm aware that we are much more than just this character that we play, and that connectedness that you mentioned, I do feel that with others every day.<br><br><br>So do you receive stuff telepathically from others that you don't have to communicate through voice, or do you just get a knowing? How does the information show up for you?  <br>Yeah, those two things are pretty synonymous—telepathy and knowing. Yeah, so I do feel that. It's hard to describe this, but it's a perception of non-physical awareness. You know, I feel my energetic connection with others, and so I may feel what's going on with them as the human or who they are more often. Actually, I feel more like who they really are, who is shining through the human character. It's like if an actor puts on clothes and plays a role, you never really can get past them being that actor. Like Robin Williams is a great actor. Every movie he's in, you know, it's Robin Williams just playing these other roles. I kind of see and feel energetically people like that a little bit. You know, like we're the soul playing through this given character and through its story and form associations. And yeah, we're all connected, and that connectedness is just supernatural. It's available to all of us when we sufficiently let go of the form association and what we're not. It's just what we are. You know, that connectedness, that aliveness, is always there, even though typically while we're veiled in the human experience, like I said, separation is such a deep part of this experience. We typically don't consciously perceive that at the human level, but that is changing. It's on the rise as we grow in awareness. We do grow in that conscious awareness and feeling of that connectedness with each other and of each other's natures.<br>So how does this show up? Give us an example of a scenario where you have gotten some extra-sensory perception, some sort of knowledge or insight or information that allowed you to communicate in a more or to achieve an outcome that wouldn't normally have been possible with somebody that maybe you just met.  <br><br><br>So sometimes I do one-on-ones with people. I'm usually very busy, but I love it. I love doing it when I can find the time to really spend time, and sometimes I'll meditate and kind of feel into who they are. So as an example, I have a lot of examples, but I'll just mention one. So this is one that has a very specific, tangible, physical result. So I guess I'll mention this example. So years ago, I was interacting with someone online who I just felt intuitively was a part of my soul tribe, you know, my family, the souls that I know so well that are very resonant with me. And I had never met her physically, but I was just so familiar with her energy. And I was highly meditated at the time, that period in life, and so I was very connected to spirit. And one day at work, I went for a walk behind my workplace up this hill, and I felt this non-physical dialogue with her. Her higher self is the word we use—that is the portion of her that is bigger than the human. I know this sounds wild. I know what I'm sharing sounds wild, but I felt this connection with her, and she gave me this energetic gift of this healing feeling down my spine, and it was really wonderful. And it was accompanied with this recognition of who I am, and I was like, "Wow, that's really beautiful. Thank you so much." And then she told me telepathically, "See that piece of moss on the ground right there? Pick that up, take that back to your desk, and tell the human me about that, and it being a sign of a gift." Like, "Okay, you know, because I try to remain skeptical about these things too. It's important to remain grounded, of course." But I took this moss back to my desk and thought, "What the hell?" So I reached out to her, and I said, "I'm pretty sure that your higher self just gave me this energy experience as a gift and then told me to bring this piece of moss back to my desk. What does that mean to you?" And she said, "I kid you not, last night I said to my husband that the perfect example of a gift that someone could give to me would be a piece of moss." And it was like, you know, that's pretty awesome. You know, when that kind of thing happens, typically it's a more personal connection. Like I'll just feel energetically who they are and what they're experiencing to some degree. You know, if I'm really form-focused, like if I've been working all week and I haven't meditated as much, that sense diminishes significantly. But if I'm clear and alert and feeling present and not cluttered in my consciousness, then I might feel all sorts of things from them—like maybe what they're dealing with in their life or what assumptions they've got mixed into the structures they've built as a human and true natures, you know, like true qualities of the soul. We each have so many unique qualities as souls, and they're very unique, very specific to each person. They're very beautiful, and so I find it's just amazing and wonderful to feel into that and to experience that and share that with someone and find and see a little "wow" of who they are here, even while we're here. Yeah, so that's difficult to describe. I know that doesn't sound too specific, but I guess the best outcome for that would simply be that I feel that sometimes I've been able to help people, you know, if they're at a place where what I might suggest would be helpful sometimes.<br>So do you get a sense for some of the unique qualities of my soul? You feel clear and meditated enough to do that? You want me to share that on the air?  <br>Of course, of course. To give it justice takes time. I need to spend time dwelling into the vibration of the person, but I can simply say you have a great kindness. It's very unobstructed in a way that's unusual, and the energy that I feel from you feels wide in a way, like it's sitting almost outside of you in a way. Because a lot of people have kind of a very protected, internalized thing. You're not really so worried about that. You're kind of—I don't like to use the terms "aura" too loosely here, but it feels like the aura would be large, wide, because your energy is just kind of out there. For me, it's like a white—I mean, so when we perceive these things, we get if there's going to be words or colors or specific form as an expression, it tends to be in our own experience language. So if somebody tells you a color, that doesn't mean that's the color that you are necessarily. It means that color might mean something to me. So I feel from you like a pale white, which is kind of a simple, pure, simple in a good way, pure willingness to be loving and caring and open, but maybe a little bit perplexed by the taller structures in the world that might try to step on you. Something like that energetically.  <br>It's awesome. Yeah, I resonate with that. Now, if you work with somebody on a longer session, one-on-one, what sort of insights do you get on the soul of that person that maybe they could apply in their day-to-day life immediately?  <br>Yeah, I can't claim any actionability because it's so—first of all, my own state will very much affect how clearly I'm able to sense what I sense. And then, if they're vibrationally—as beings, we have familiarity with certain vibrational qualities. Like we know certain things, we've experienced certain things, we could even say we've mastered certain things, and then we ourselves have our own vibrational quality. So that means that when we interact with the vibration of another, there may be portions of them that we can't even really understand, I guess would be the best way to put it, and others that might be very resonant. So there are some individuals with whom I feel strong resonance, that I feel that sensing from them energetically is very easy, while with others I might not feel so resonant, and the sensing is not as easy. So anyway, all I can do is to offer what I sense in case it is helpful to them, simply to remind them if it's helpful because I don't claim to have any special knowledge. That's not how this works. If it's helpful to just kind of remind them who they really are because a lot of us get lost within the form association. We get lost within the negative stories, within the fear patterns, within the pain, within the trauma. Right? So there's a lot of people who are wrapped into trauma, and then they forget that they're really a being of deep kindness, as an example, because of all the trauma. They become very prickly or something. You know, that's okay. That's fine. But then to remind them, "Oh my gosh, you really have a lot of kindness," and it might be so natural to them to feel that kindness, but it's been lost in trauma so long ago that might not be helpful. So I can't claim any specific outcome. I can at least say that.<br><br><br>Okay, so then there's another layer. I don't mean to make this sound even more mystical because I like to stay grounded about these things, but there's also an energetic exchange. So sometimes I've been able to interact with somebody non-physically in a way that I feel is helpful. So even though they might not be consciously aware of it, there could be like a way to nudge or interact with the energy body in a way that is useful. Everyone, we're on Earth right now, so because we're on Earth, we have an advantage for each other that the guides don't necessarily have, and that is we're all local. So we've all got a similar resonance. We're all like in the lower vibrational realm of Earth, whereas guides are very high vibrations. <br>So for them to interact with us, it can often be tricky. So our advantage here is that if we can offer a vibration of love and support to each other here, it can be really effective and potent because we're both at the dense level. So our resonance is not as far. I don't know if I can describe that well.  <br>Gotcha. Okay, yeah, that's a very personal question you asked, and I'm not sure. There's so many ways I could speak to it, and you know what I mean? It's like it's so hard to speak to, and I don't consider myself like I don't consider that to be like a main thing that I do. I just really enjoy doing it because connecting with other people is joyful—really connecting, really feeling each other, feeling our sharing our vulnerabilities and our joys and where we really are. That's joyful. That's like our true nature always shares for real, not the fake stuff. So I just really enjoy doing that, but I don't claim to be any kind of psychic or medium or even an energy worker, even though I do work with energy. I wouldn't label myself in that way.  <br>That's cool though. I had a session once with Arya Lauren. I learned about her from Mindvalley, from Vishen Lakhiani. So I did a session with her, and she looked in my eyes and said, "I just see so much love there." She looked into my soul—like eyes are the windows to the soul—and when she looks in people's eyes, she connects with who they really are, and she saw so much love, and I just loved hearing that. You know, it's just validating because that's exactly the word I was trying to look for.  <br>Yeah, validating. That's exactly the word. Yeah, I mean, I think it's apparent. I think that people can see it on the surface even if they're not energetically sensitive, but we only see the physical result, whereas the energy of who someone is—like, you know, like, PE individuals may be masterful as souls in certain ways. You know what I mean? So like, you have a masterful quality in a way that's like kindness and love that is obvious, but that doesn't mean that you're necessarily masterful at other things. <br>It's just how it is. You know, we learn and we grow, and so for us, like I feel like one of the main things we do on Earth actually is coming to walk on our weak leg or to deepen a strength by knowing its opposite. In both of those cases, we take on something that's very alien to us, very challenging to us, in order to expand, in order to grow. So like, a challenge for me might not be a challenge for someone like my wife. There's certain things that are challenges for me that are not at all a challenge for her, and vice versa. That's okay. That's how it is.  <br>Well, it's a big challenge for you that you're going through now.  <br><br><br>Well, I mean, the main fear that I came to process in this life has some depth to it. I've processed so much, so it's complicated. Fear is a complex topic. At this current moment in my life, my current struggle is trying to come to terms with navigating really two types of work. One is mainstream work, you know, within the mainstream business environment and the energies of that environment, and the other is the spiritual sharing work. For me, I feel I want to be responsible for my family, so I do the former, and I don't charge anything for the latter. I don't ask for money. <br>So you know, I've chosen to work to earn money and then to just try to give away what I can in the teaching work, but there's a cost. There's an energetic cost to that in order to remain sensitive. And remaining sensitive in an environment of bureaucracy and inauthenticity at times and politics and all the energetic demands of having many hours of meetings in a day—that's very challenging for me on a day-to-day basis. <br>So I would say at the current time, that's probably the main thing that I struggle with because I'm trying to really play the human game all the way and not be afraid to do what's hard. It is hard for me to actually do both. I only have certain physical resources. I have health challenges other people may not have, and I have energy limitations, especially because I'm so sensitive. Like I feel like when you have high sensitivity and when you process a lot of information when you're open to spirit, it means that everything might like routine action can be wider bandwidth and might require more energy. So I definitely fall into that category, and that makes day-to-day demands potentially challenging for me.  <br>Gotcha. So when you're connecting with people, you're connecting with nature, with animals, with all that is, do you find some of that to be draining and that lowers your energy, or no?  <br><br><br>No, no, that's very rejuvenating. Right now, the connection of spirit is rejuvenating. What I find draining is you could think of it like vibrational resonance in simple terms because I have to resonate down into the mean vibration, meaning the average or the middle, the median vibration of a place or a group or a company or whatever, in order to really be there and interact. At least that's been my experience, and that can be draining for me because I'm energetically sensitive and because I really feel everything and I really am processing it all. So there can be a challenge there. But now returning to the connectedness is wonderful and peaceful and life-giving. You know, when I do a session with someone or even when I do a talk like this, I feel rejuvenated. I feel strengthened by it.  <br>Yeah, you know, it's all learning. You know, I'm going through my lessons too on all this, and what I found to be helpful, rejuvenating, and reconnecting is while I'm in the midst of something that could be difficult or lower vibration, I just wave at God in a metaphorical way, using my third eye. Imagine like an emoji of a wave or hands together emoji of thank you, just to keep a connection going so that I can be in both worlds simultaneously—this world and the upper worlds.  <br>One comment that comes to mind as you say that, since you invited the intuitive share, is to be cognizant of any negative self-perceptions that you are assuming are real as the challenges arrive.  <br>So give me an example of that.  <br><br><br>So if you have a challenge that arises and it makes you feel bad, you might actually be buying into a perception of powerlessness or unworthiness without even recognizing it. And then it's when we buy into the negative self-perceptions that fear rises, you know, and then the ego and all the shenanigans rise out of that. But the negative self-perception at the root is actually not true. Like as spiritual beings, we are powerful, completely free, loving, joyful, creative. That is our true nature. We're completely worthy. We're completely free. We're more powerful than we could possibly imagine. So if we're in a low vibration environment, we don't have to meet them where they're at. We can just show up with our light, and then everything changes. You know, we're not changing them. We're just changing everything.  <br>I absolutely agree with that. If we can show up with the presence and with our own—I don't like using the duality terms "higher" and "lower," but higher vibration—if we just arrive with the higher vibration, that is actually a service. But what I meant by the draining aspect is more very specifically in my case. So if you go to an environment, whether it's physical or non-physical, that has a certain average vibration, it tends to pull you into it. That's all I'm saying. Even the collective consciousness of humanity, especially the collective consciousness of humanity, has an average vibrational level, and it's actually very low by comparison to the higher realms. <br>So like, that's one of the reasons why peak experiences tend to wane. You know, if we come up and have this amazing state or a near-death experience and feel the love and the connectedness, over time we tend to return back to the more mean vibration, the average vibration of Earth, because we're a part of the vibrational system, and the vibrations tend to equalize. But actually, that's also why we're providing a valuable service by being higher vibration. Actually, by being present with more love, more openness, more authenticity, that is pulling—I don't know what the right word is—it's coaxing, even, you could say, the average vibration up and helping to free it. I don't want to make it sound like though that the negative is like a real thing. It's not. <br>There's not really a duality going on. It's actually pure love and joy and peace that has temporarily lost itself in association with something that is not. It's important to put in this context because I'm not saying there's like a real spectrum, but what we're doing here is losing ourselves in that form. You know, that's like the name of the human game is believing, "Oh, I'm just a job," and "Oh, this person did this thing to me," and "Oh, I don't make enough money," you know, whatever those perceptions might be, and then losing our identity in those perceptions. <br>And then we get our self-worth tied in, and you know, we don't actually need to do that. But I'm not saying it's easy to identify that and to feel it. It's one of the reasons meditation is so important, by the way—not to change topics too many times in one response—but meditation can really help us to find underneath all those stories that we think are so important today, all the denseness, we really already are peace and joy right now.  <br>It's very hard to like if you're in the thick of it and you don't have that experience of being peace and joy, it's hard to imagine when you hear somebody talk about it.  <br>Yeah, it can even piss you off.  <br>Yeah, the ego. The ego can even get really ticked off when someone says that, right? Because, "No, I'm mad. I'm angry. I'm miserable. Don't tell me that's nice and peace and joy. I got pain. Yeah, how dare you?"  <br>Yeah, how dare you tell me that I'm love and peace and joy. I mean, it's kind of ironic because it's interesting when you share a message of unconditional love, a lot of ego responses may rise up, but unconditional love is the truth. It's the truth. But anyway, that's okay. It's okay that that happens. If you notice that in yourself, which you know, it happens, just notice in yourself, "Well, how do you think you don't have that? How do you think that life has proven to you that you're not worthy or that you're not free or that you're not joyful?" And then be brave enough because it takes bravery, willingness, humility to actually go and feel that pain that you felt, to feel that negative self-perception, to feel the trauma, to heal it by going into it and saying, "You know what, I actually do feel this way. Wow." You know, that's owning your own crap. When you do that, that takes a certain quality of intention to do that.  <br><br><br>Something you said earlier I just want to circle back on, and you mentioned the word "skeptical." Try to stay a little skeptical, grounded. I don't consider those terms synonymous with each other, by the way. They're two different things.  <br>Yeah, they're different, but yeah.  <br>And actually, I consider skeptical pretty low vibration, and if I dare say, even almost to the vibration of cynical. I would draw a significant distinction between skepticism and cynicism.  <br>It's almost like they're two sides of the same coin, though.  <br>I think that's my personal—okay, we can create a new neutral term for skepticism that means simply that you don't take things, you don't believe things immediately, and that you try to discern what is real and what is not. That's important. That's important to do.  <br>I hear where you're coming from, but I've got something here that maybe try it on for size, see if it fits. It's an expression I forgot where I heard it from, but it's "the willing suspension of disbelief," and I really resonate with that. I used to consider myself a skeptic, but now I feel like, "Ah, this fits me much better—the willing suspension of disbelief." So I'm not immediately discounting or looking at something with skepticism. I'm open-minded about it. I'm not immediately trusting it, but I've suspended my disbelief. What do you think?  <br><br><br>Yeah, so I'm reminded of the mantra, so to speak, that Tom Campbell lives by when it comes to these topics. He says it's important to remain open-minded and skeptical. Open-mindedness is the suspension of disbelief. That's important too, but they're both important, you know, because we need to be open-minded, but we also need to be willing to discern. That can actually be really important even as we self-explore internally and even as we meditate because the ego wants a quick fix. <br>It wants a quick answer. "Tell me what to believe so I can feel better. I just want to believe something so my fears are washed away." Whereas it's okay to pause and say, "You know what, I actually don't know if that's true. I actually don't know if I live after my physical body dies, for instance. I actually don't know if what I believe is real or not." That's scary, but it's important because if we're not willing to actually question, then we may not go and actually seek and explore the reality. <br>And the reality is really good news. Like, at the bottom of everything, it's total peace and freedom and love and joy. It is. But until you get there, it's okay if you're like, "Okay, I don't see that on the surface. I want to go find out." Go into the dark closet and find out. Test reality. Test your own consciousness. Test your association with form, with beliefs, with identity, with story. Go spend the time looking at that, and that requires both open-mindedness and whatever this new word that we can create is—like, yeah, skepticism in that context. I like discernment. You mentioned discerning.  <br>Discernment. Yeah, it requires discernment. You know, it's fun. You know, each word has a corresponding vibration, or maybe it's the vibration has a corresponding word. I don't know which way it goes, but the difference between gratitude and appreciation is a vibrational frequency. So if you're in gratitude, that's different from being in appreciation, and if you're in appreciation, that's different from being in gratitude. And I try to be in both.  <br><br><br>Yeah, that's really cool that you say that because there's a—so absolutely, and there is a—okay, spirit is ridiculously subtle and good at navigating broad spectrums of differentiation in vibration, in meaning, in feeling. It's very rich and nuanced, very nuanced. So of course, one word to another and how it's been used over human history is going to have a different vibration. I mean, our whole collective consciousness has many, many forms that it's built up—beliefs, languages, symbols, words, you know, whatever that are in the collective that have meaning, and those meanings might even shift and change. You know, like for instance, I suspect—let's just take something silly like the acronym "LOL." <br>You know, that has a different vibrational meaning to it, vibrational nature now than it did 20 years ago because of all the history that's gone into it. And some symbols have lasted with us for thousands of years, and even their meaning has shifted or become its own thing. Like in the astral, a thought form can become its own mass, you know. So you might take an idea like Jesus or something, you know, and you've got the man, the being Jesus, and then you've got the thought form of the belief in Jesus, and even Christianity—those are different thought forms. They might not be exactly the same thing, but anyway, so that's just a lengthy comment to your comment about different words having different vibrations. They definitely do. Every thought, every intention actually has its own pitch.  <br>Yeah, it's very nuanced.  <br>Can you describe for our listener a thought form?  <br><br><br>Yeah, so okay, I'll use a metaphor to try to depict this because I know thought form might seem abstract. Okay, so one time I was in a meditation circle, and a woman in the circle said something about China, which has meaning to me because I lived in China earlier in this life, and I was in a meditative state, and I saw and heard and felt her thought about China reach around the world and touch all that was China. I could see, I could perceive it. It had an energetic mass, you could say, to it. <br>So it was like a thing. It was like a stone or something that was thrown around the world, so to speak, energetically, and I was like, "Oh my gosh." I knew intellectually that thought form was real and had mass, but I perceived it very directly, very tangibly. It was like, "Oh my gosh, like every one of our thoughts and intentions is doing this." So in higher realms and thought-responsive realms, we tend to get thought forms presented to us that match vibrationally, you know, wherever we are, whatever we're expecting, whatever we believe, whatever language, whatever the experienced language needs to depict to us using those forms. So thought form, you could just think of it like an object that has a mass or momentum that is a thought or an idea. And certain ideas or thoughts have been repeated so much that they have substantial mass in the human collective consciousness.  <br>Gotcha. And in astral realms, that may transcend even the human collective consciousness because we're actually—not to sound too abstract here—but we're actually creating. One of the creative acts we're doing here without even knowing it is adding to thought form, like adding to the thought form library, you could say, just by living a novel experience, you know, in creating things, inventing things. <br>And actually, that reminds me of one other thing. If you can have even—I know this is going to sound really tangential, but it's pertinent too—if you in your whole lifetime have one novel thought or one novel feeling that the all that is has never known before, your whole life has been worth it because you have added something to all that is—some newness, some depth. We're on the leading edge of creation, as Abraham likes to say. Abraham Hicks. We are this is the lead frontier. This is the messy, cool, hard, in-your-face, rigorous, high-value, high-efficiency but potentially apparently destructive frontier.  <br>Yeah, creative destruction. It only appears like destruction, but yeah, but it's all beautiful, and it's all perfect, and divinely orchestrated, but we don't see it sometimes.  <br>Be lucky to get a glimpse of it.  <br>Yeah, so I wouldn't use the word "lucky." I'd be sensitive to that because that implies that no, you're just stuck being just a human.  <br>About words and vibrations, right? So "lucky" is not the right word to use. "Fortunate" is a better word. That's a better vibration.  <br>But even that—yeah, your higher self sees. The higher self, the higher portion of you, already sees very clearly. You could think you are already up on the cliff looking over the whole forest, even though you're down in the trees. You just might not be consciously aware of it at the human level because that's the name of the game, and you got lost in the trees. But if you let go of the trees all the way, the beautiful higher view arises on its own.  <br><br><br>So when you have thoughts and you formulate words from those thoughts, and there are vibrations that are associated with those thoughts, and you're trying to communicate telepathically to somebody—whether it's a human or a being, a non-physical being, or it's an animal—you know, animal communicators who are very successful at this, they communicate telepathically to the animal. We unknowingly do it with our pets. You know, like, "I'm taking her to the vet today," like I didn't do or say anything different, and she went and hid in the closet. Right? They know. They know.  <br>So how do you communicate with animals using your abilities? Any awesome stories to share in that front?  <br>No awesome stories in that area. I do have a tree nearby in my house that I very much like to hang out with. It's half dead, but it's quite vibrantly alive energetically. Anyway, so this might be going a bit deeper than what you were asking, but it's pertinent. So the fundamental substrate of what is is consciousness itself, spirit itself. And what is spirit? It's connected. It's all one thing. It's one. Okay, so then what does spirit do? It intends. <br>So that means it moves in some way, and intention precedes all form, actually. All realities, all thought, then it works through thought, it works through realities. You know, I can then make, I can wield an intention and decide what to do in this context. Yes, every day we do that many, many times. Okay, so the reason I'm saying that is simply that intention is the active ingredient both for manifestation and for telepathic communication because you could say, to put it in a metaphor, we're all connected to the same database, and the higher self is looking at the database all the time, all of us. So we're sending messages to each other even if we're not consciously aware of it.  <br>Yeah, sometimes I might have a non-physical experience while my body is sleeping where someone will give me a message, and I don't know why. You know, sometimes it's completely not—I can't tell why it's relevant, maybe it's not relevant, at least in a way that I recognize. But we are always connected and communicating with each other all the time. So I'm just saying that because the way you know, telepathy is the normal communication when we're not constricted to the physical and having to throw sounds at each other, which is a ridiculous, inefficient process. <br>In higher realms, we dump exactly what we're thinking and feeling and get exactly what we're thinking and feeling or what they're thinking and feeling, and it's very full, very complete, like a whole book at once. It doesn't need to be like word, word, word, word. It's like no, exactly. And it's more about what you're actually experiencing and what I'm actually experiencing. So I'm saying all that in context to your question because when we wish to telepathically exchange, it's as simple as dropping our own form association and issuing intention towards them. <br>And that intention might be through a thought, through a message, and the more focus and clarity we have with it, the more clear it is, the more pointed it is, and that's how manifestation kind of works like that too. Reality is always listening to us too, and our intention is what's nudging the probabilities all the time versus like ego thought-mongering. They don't have much oomph, but at the soul level, where we're clear and where we're focused and where we're intentional, that is very powerful. So telepathy can occur there.  <br><br><br>Yeah, no, you mentioned how it's instantaneous, and it's like a whole book essentially all at once instead of a word at a time, and that reminded me of Rabbi Alon Anava's near-death experience that he shared. It's a viral video. I'll include it in the show notes for this episode. It's fascinating. And at one point, he was above his body, which was passed at that point. He was in a cab, or the body was in a cab, and he's flying above the cab or being kind of pulled along with his body, just I don't know, some number of feet above the taxi. <br>Well, at one point, his soul intersects with an apartment building. He goes through that apartment building, and instantaneously, as he's going through that apartment building, he knows all the thoughts of every single occupant, and not only their thoughts and emotions and everything, their entire worldview and life history and where things are going—like all of it, all at once.  <br>Amazing. Yeah, the pre-life review is actually kind of like that too in the pre-incarnate state. It's like an all-at-once review, you know, like two seconds or something is you know how I would compare it to review millions and millions of possibilities of how the life might unfold. Spirit has a huge bandwidth. You know, your ability as a soul—this might be an important thing to lift up—as an individual, your ability to know with a capital K maybe is really big, really wide. It's much bigger and wider than, "Oh, I'm going to think one thought about my sandwich," or "I'm going to think this one philosophical thought today, and now I have the answer." No, much bigger than that.  <br>Yeah, much wider bandwidth.  <br>Yeah, it's like the difference between, I don't know, like a one-bit-at-a-time telegraph versus high-speed, high-bandwidth internet connection.  <br>Exactly. Yeah, it is like that. Spirit's high-speed internet connection is ridiculously big, ridiculously high bandwidth.  <br>Another analogy I like to use is this one: when I was shown the Matrix, this illusion, in the middle of the night on January 22nd, 2021, it was like a terabyte or many terabytes of data being jammed into a 1-gigabyte thumb drive, and of course, I couldn't retain it. So I was like, "Grasp, no, yeah, you can't fit it all in there. It's all gone. Like, I can't retain any of it. I just have the knowing that I saw what the true nature of reality is." So when I was shown the Matrix of how this illusion really works, I couldn't retain it. I know I experienced it, and I was given that glimpse, and it was massive, but it wasn't supported by my current hardware.  <br>No, you got it. No, absolutely. It's like, you know, the human body is like a tuna can. It's just a small, dense, firm thing. It can't fit the Library of Congress, all the books in the tuna can, or even bigger. You can't fit the Earth in a tuna can. You know, that is what it's like. And then we're like, "Oh, but I want to hold on to it." Well, part of what's limiting us actually is all—so there's the physical constraints, there's the non-physical constraints of the veil. Those are important too, but there's another thing going on, which is that we understand reality through crude, clunky, simple forms, very simple from the human point of view. So in order to make sense of what we just received, that third thing can also limit how much we're able to retain and integrate.  <br>Yeah, yeah. So what are some of the non-physical constraints of the veil?  <br><br><br>Yeah, so the veil is a set of constraints on consciousness and in consciousness that permit us to focus entirely down into the physical experience. So the veil primarily is an obscuring, like a partitioning maybe, but an obscuring that deeply obscures the memory of all that you are and the conscious access to all the knowing that is in the universe. Those two things—it's pretty much one thing, but the connectedness and the feeling of the live connectedness to everything else. <br>Yeah, so it obscures those portions of our native being, and that is very, very alien by the way to do that. It's not normal, not common, not typical. Like your right hand not realizing that the left hand is kind of related. Exactly. It's really like, and then when they hurt each other, yeah, and then they're hurting each other, and then you're like, "Oh my gosh, I'm hurting myself. Why are you doing that?" It doesn't make any sense to do that. Love is like that. It doesn't make any sense to hurt anybody else. It just doesn't make any sense.  <br>Yeah, yeah. So the veil is the constraints in consciousness that allow the vibrational focus down into this very low vibration where we don't remember. That's a simple way to describe that, and we believe the illusion of separation.  <br><br><br>Yep. Yeah, that's the name of the game: believe the illusion of separation and then learn, integrate, experience through it—not learn intellectually. Well, there's intellectual learning too, but experientially learn through that experience of apparent separation. We've pushed the boundaries really far. This is as far as we've gone so far in the depth of separation. Like, this universe is like super, super separate-feeling.  <br>Yeah, very, very unique, very dense. High, high, high extreme sports for the spirit.  <br>Yeah, we're doing the American Ninja Warrior thing in the universe.  <br>Yes, to put it lightly.  <br>Now, I interviewed a while back a guy named Joe McQuillan who wrote a book about his experience of losing his son and having a psychic connection with that son, and he described what he calls "thin places" where the veil is thinner, such as in his son's room. And there are times as well—he calls that also a thin place—so 3:00 a.m., middle of the night, for him is a thin place, and his son's room is a thin place. So for me, and I think for a lot of people, Jerusalem is a thin place, or even just Israel generally, is one of the thinnest places as far as where the veil between this world and the upper world is thinnest. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on all that.  <br><br><br>Sure. I'm not agreeing, but there are no places. So what I mean is that really what you're describing I feel is a vibrational difference. There's a vibrational difference for the meaning, like we were talking about words have vibration. The meaning, the memory of the child's room—that's vibrationally different. Jerusalem, with millions of people having utilized that place in a certain way and pursued the divine through their traditions in that place—that's a vibrational difference. <br>So it's not so much that there are places and that the veil is a physical thing and it's overlaying all these places, though the physical of course does have its own properties, and I'm not saying there aren't energetic differences between places. There are. I'm just pointing out that really what we're talking about is a shift in vibration, basically. When we're in higher vibration or when we've given ourselves a permission slip in the world of form, we tend to be less—so it's not that the veil is gone. <br>It's just that we've vibrationally lifted closer to our true nature, and that is if that is a thinner veil because the closer we are vibrationally, the more we have access to, the more we feel, the more we know, the more we can touch. You could say the veil is porous or organic. It's not like it hard-cuts you off. It's just obscuring. All it does is obscure so that you end up focusing on the movie really hard. That's all it does. But if you stop focusing on the movie really hard, then you realize you're in a movie theater, and then you realize you're in a movie theater.  <br>Exactly. Yeah, no, exactly. That's exactly what it is. And you're like, "Oh, well, I'm still veiled," yeah, because, "Man, that movie is really bright," and then get sucked right back in because it's really bright, and it's got your attention. It doesn't have to have your attention. It's just that most people don't typically just, you know, numerically, most people don't typically go and spend the time to meditate every day for years to go find out, to go explore their consciousness beneath all thought.  <br>Yeah, because the thought is part of the movie. You know, it's like, "I'm this. I got to do this," right? Like, I was just at work before this, and I was—my mind was full of many thoughts about work, and I spent 30 minutes meditating and returning to not losing my identity in the thoughts about what?  <br>Good for you. Meditation is so—not that that's easy all the time.  <br>Oh my goodness. The hour flew by.  <br>So if our—well, first of all, you're welcome back anytime. This is a fascinating discussion. So if you want to come back for a part two at any point, I would love to have you.  <br>Thank you, sir. But also, I just—yeah, I love what you're up to in the world. I want to acknowledge you for what you're contributing in terms of revelation of light into the world. And if our listener or viewer wants to learn more from you, where do you want to send them to? Of course, you've got your book and so forth. Maybe a website address or a social media account or something?  <br>Yeah, sure. Yeah, my website is awalkinthephysical.com. The book has the same name, A Walk in the Physical. The website has a book page where the third link down, the entire book is available to be read online for free. It's not about money. I just want to share. And also, that site has a collection of many different talks I've participated in if it's an interesting subject for someone to help.  <br>And regarding the thanks, I want to thank you because, like, you know, you mentioned the love. I can feel your love. It's beautiful, man. You're—I would trust you right off the bat. You're just a trust—really beautiful person. So thank you so much for the work you're doing in the world and your presence. Don't doubt yourself. Let me know if there's any way I can help.  <br>Thank you so much, Christian. And thank you, listener. You too are a light in the world. Go out there and make it a beautiful week. We'll catch you in the next episode. I'm your host, Stefan Spencer, signing off.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2024/a-deeper-look-at-existence-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2024/A Deeper Look at Existence with Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:05:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Walk in the Physical with Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJobtv6sk6Q" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJobtv6sk6Q</a><br>22 MAY 2024<br><br><br>Okay, hey, well, I want to welcome everybody to another Consciousness Cafe event. Our focus is in trying to help everybody that has an interest in metaphysical subjects appreciate the breadth of who they are, to learn more, to be able to ask questions, to be advocates for change, help other people who are maybe getting started on their path. We all come from different places, different understandings, and it's through sharing with each other that we expand our awareness of all that we are and how reality works.<br>So tonight, we have a very interesting guest. His name is Christian Sundberg. I've had the pleasure of peripherally being aware of his background. He's a very popular speaker. His message—I won't go into delving and exploring what it is at this point—but it's a fantastic concept. His experience helps open the door to a broader understanding of things. So, I want to welcome Christian. With that, Christian, can you get started and share your story?<br>Thank you, Jim. I appreciate it. Thank you, everybody. It's wonderful to be here. I had the pleasure of meeting Jim last year in DC, and I still remember Jim's energy. So, thank you for being there, Jim. It's meaningful.<br>So, what I'm going to try to share is beyond language. Okay? So, words don't work. We'll do our best, but words are symbols. They're forms that are specific to our local world. So, I'll just use the words we have, but I have to disclaim that first because there's just no language for what we are. Like, there's no good, fully accurate language. So, I just have to say that first.<br>So, I won't share my entire experience for the sake of time. Jim did ask for me to touch on a few specific topics, but I'll just share at a high level. So, my body is 44 years old right now. At the age of 30, I took up a long-term meditation practice, and after a few months, began to have out-of-body experiences. I also had pre-birth memory return to me after maybe six or eight months or something. And I remember the incarnation process. I remember why I'm here, what I wanted to do with this life, and I can feel the veil on me right now. Like, I walk around every day aware of the presence of the veil. The veil just being what we call the limitations in consciousness space that we wear in order to have the physical experience of being human.<br>And so, I am very passionate about sharing what we really are to the best that we can because our true nature is love and peace and joy and freedom. That is what we really are. And we have come deep into this physical experience, and we've really kind of lost the forest for the trees. You know, we get really deep into the association with the human story, but that's not purpose. We're doing that for a reason, but even so, we've taken it pretty seriously.<br>And I am very passionate about just trying to remind others of who we really are because who we really are is absolutely wonderful, and there is nothing to fear. That's like Cliff Notes ending. There's nothing to fear, and love is the true power. Okay? So, I'll share briefly, and please do interrupt with questions. I do want this to be organic. I have a couple of points I wanted to touch on, but I did feel that I should leave space for organic discussion. I always like to try to meet people where they are.<br>So, you know, most people are interested in me to share my pre-birth experience, so I'll share some of that. I don't think that's the most important thing to talk about. I think what's most important is, like, what are we like for real, really underneath, underneath the physical, underneath the meat suit experience. You know, what are we really? But hopefully, the experience will help at least in part. Okay?<br>So, I know this sounds wild. Like, I'm a normal person as much as they come, I guess. I work a normal mainstream professional job, kind of thing. You know, I have a family. I'm a father, and I'm active in my community. I do all those things. So, I'm not—I know this sounds wild, but I remember before I had ever been physical, before I had had any physical incarnation experiences, coming across a being who had been physical and being very inspired, deeply, deeply inspired by the quality of this being's nature. His essence, like his quality of being, was so rich and so deep and so beautiful and so full of joy and power, and I was just so inspired by this being because, you know, I asked him, like, what could you possibly have done to be this? It's telepathic, and in those higher reality systems, we communicate by thought. There's no words necessary. We are all connected, and so we feel and know that connection, and we can share full exchanges of knowing and feeling instantaneously.<br>So, I could feel from him like what he was, and I was like, "Oh my gosh, are you really like that? What? How is it even possible that you are that full of joy and freedom and power?" And he shared with me that he had—well, he shared with me many things, but chief among them was he had lived a physical life in particular where he had a long-term pain, a health condition that he strove with—not against, but strove, worked with—for years in this one physical experience. And the way that he chose to meet it, the way that he processed it, allowed a certain refinement of his being. That's the only way I can describe it. It was so powerful, and I was like, "I want to do that. Like, I want to do that. I want to do that." And he said something to me of the effect of, like, "This is not negative," and it wasn't like it wasn't critical, but it was like, "Yeah, that's what they all say. You just don't know how hard it is. Like, obviously, you're just ignorant to it." And I was persistent. I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do that." And he said, "Well, go talk to your guides."<br>So, I won't go through all the detail, but I lived many times, and I had a preceding experience before this life where I had—so, okay, I'll just say that my primary intention for this life and the preceding life just before this one was to process a specific fear that had bested me in a previous experience. Like, in a previous experience, I went down the fear path very deeply, and fear gives rise to ego. And so, in that life, I was an egoic, damaging person. And so, I knew that that fear was something that—ah, the words are bad—like something that I had experienced. I don't want to say that I was that I am because fear itself isn't even real, but anyway, this certain area of experience that had bested me in the past.<br><br><br>So, they brought to me a preceding life that was a really good match to meet that fear and process it. And I remember accepting the veil for that life, which can only be described as a huge plummet in vibration in the body of one's being, down from being connected to everything and knowing everything and just being in total connectedness and bliss, down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower into like—and then lower, and then like when you feel like you get to the bottom, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. Like, that's how it felt vibrationally to come all the way down into the physical experience of this preceding life.<br>And I reacted in fear immediately. I was still in the womb. I had not—the body had not been born yet, and I reacted in fear, and I was like, "I'm not doing this. There's no freaking way. Like, this is so low vibration. I don't remember who I am. I lost everything. I am not doing this. Like, just no, no." So, I had this fear rise up, and I fought my way out. I smoked the veil. I pushed past it, and that caused that previous life to end prematurely. The body died, and I had a life review for that short life, and I could see how my fear had impacted the poor mother because I basically heaped grief upon her shoulders because she had a miscarriage of my body. And I could see how her grief affected hundreds of other people.<br>And so, I still wanted to meet this fear. Trying remains to—so, they brought me this life sometime later, and I reviewed this life in incredible detail—millions and millions of possibilities of what might unfold in this life potentially. And I could feel what it would be like to be me in as a human, as the character, as Christian, the character, you know. And I made certain requests to the life, and eventually, there was a time to accept it. And then I was in this waiting area for a while, and then this guide came to me and said, "Go now. Like, now's the time." And then I was in this room that I can only describe as like a technician shop or an auto shop or something like a tinker workshop, and there were these beings there who are very technical in nature, and they're very skilled at applying the veil to an individual.<br>Because the individual soul is so unique and rich in its qualities, and each given life—the biology, the circumstances, the energy of the species, the planet—like, it's all very complex, and they do this thing where they make it fit. They make it all jive. And I remember them asking me one last time, "Are you sure?" And I said, "Yes." And then once again, the same plummet and vibration down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower. And this time, I tried not to fight the veil because I didn't want to fail again. Not that it's a failure, but I didn't want to cause a premature ending again.<br>So, then I was in the womb for a while, and then after a while, I was like, "I'm not doing this. This is not happening. This is ridiculous. Like, a whole lifetime? It's no, no, no. I'm not doing that." So, once again, I began to summon my strength, my might, to fight my way out. And when I did that, I had the most holy moment of my experience here, and it's beyond language. It's very holy to me and beyond any description, but the source of all things—what we call God, that is the "I am" at the bedrock of all—came to me and expanded me back out, and I felt all of the universe within me and beyond. And I felt, including our sun, Earth's sun, I felt it within me, and it was churning with bliss. It was like a raging ball of bliss.<br>And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And I was like, "Oh, oh, okay, okay." So, then I stopped fighting because I knew that if I had—because I was fighting because I felt like I lost all that I am, and I was going to fight in fear to get that back, to claw that back. But in this experience, I was shown, "Oh, I know I didn't lose all that I am. Oh, okay." So, I stopped fighting, and I returned to being in the womb. And then I felt like I was there for a very long time, and then I remember being born. I remember the shock of the birth experience and having no idea what was going on but being super curious. And then, yeah, that's a super short version of the story.<br>At the age of 10 days old, my body almost died. I had a respiratory thing, and I turned blue, and they baptized me in the hospital. So, I still wonder if maybe part of my experience is associated with that somehow. But then, as I got older, I had certain memories from the pre-birth experience that I just assumed everybody knew, but nobody seemed to talk about. And I would cheat, like draw upon the flowchart memory, and basically try to look ahead and see what was going to happen. And that ability diminished as I aged. You know, by the age of five or six, I couldn't do that anymore. I wasn't allowed to cheat anymore. But I also had other assumptions that I assumed would be true here on Earth because of the way things work in higher reality systems.<br>Like, for instance, I assumed we would be able to feel each other's emotions here because that's very normal in every other system. That's not common here, and when we do, it's very muted usually because we are right now in this experience where we are experiencing a very deep state of separation. That is like the name of the game here is the separation, so we don't feel each other's emotions telepathically. And I also assumed that, just in our society, beings who were in positions of power or authority would be loving and wise because, in other systems, that's how it is. The more loving and wise you are, those beings are in positions of authority—it's a bad word because it's not like the way we think of authority—but positions of authority, basically. And like, just automatically, if you're in a position of authority, that means you're loving and wise. Like, why else would you be in a position of authority? You know what I mean?<br>So, I assumed that even as a young child. I remember thinking, "Oh, my teacher must be really loving, and the president of the United States must be like the most loving and wise person out of all of our huge country." You know? That's not how it works on Earth. I've since discovered, but anyway, so that memory left me completely by the age of around five or six. So, I had no awareness of that at all in my teens and 20s. And then, at the age of 30, when it came back, it was the most normal thing in the world. But see, I was already in a place in an awareness. I was already meditating and having out-of-body experiences, and so this was just like someone blew leaves off of the ground. It wasn't like a huge, the sky split epiphany or something. It was just, "Oh, that's like the most normal thing. You're not human. Oh, yeah. Oh, wow. Okay, this is weird being human. Okay, I get it." You know?<br>And then I didn't really talk about it too much, but I did share it a few times, and eventually, somebody said, "You really should share that. That's extraordinary." And I said, "It is?" Like, it didn't occur to me. It seems so normal, you know? And then, eventually, I shared it at around the age of 38, about six years ago. And in the meantime, in my mid-30s, I began to receive intuitive chunks of information downloads—you could say—that became my book. It's called "A Walk in the Physical." It took about six years to get it all down and to organize it in the intuitive way that it's organized because it's an atypically organized book. And I just—oh my gosh—I had this bone-level intuitive deep calling to get that book published. Like, I didn't even—if only one person ever saw it for one sentence, I just knew that I was so deeply compelled. I can't express the level of bone-level, like, "You must get this physical."<br>So, now that it is physical, I'm incredibly humbled and surprised at how it's been received and the number of people it's reached. And it's amazing. So, I'm absolutely humbled, and I'm so happy and overjoyed to be able to share in whatever way I can. You know, all of us are that. That's the important thing. It's not about me. All of us are that love, that spirit that is connected to all things, and we come with intentionality. So, if there's any questions, I'll stop, but there were two points I wanted to make that Jim asked me to comment on. So, I'll pause for a second, and if there's no questions, I'll comment on his two points.<br>I've got some questions. Sure, Bruce has got his hand raised. Why don't you start off, Bruce?<br>Hi, Bruce. Hi, Christian. Nice to meet you. I don't think we've met before. Yeah, two questions. I guess the first one is about something you said. Can you say more about when you said you're not human? What does that mean to you? Yeah. And the second one is a question I'll let you say something about that first, and then the second question is something I've struggled with for a long time, and I'd like your sure on.<br><br><br>Yeah, so I know it sounds crazy, but none of us are actually human. What we are—what you are—is you. Like, what I mean is, the you that feels like you to you is who you are now. You might think that that you that feels like you to you means human. It actually doesn't. It's your consciousness, your spirit itself, the knowing quality of the "I" that you are. That is the most familiar "I." So, you could say very simply, in dry terms, we are consciousness, and consciousness engages a set of forms that is sense data and thoughts primarily. Those are the two big categories of forms we experience here all the time. Sense data being sight, sound, touch, smell—all that good stuff. We see a body, we touch a body, we feel a body. Oh, look, a body. And then we think about the body. We apply meaning to the world. You know, we see distance, we interpret it. All these thoughts, all these ideas, that's all occurring within consciousness.<br>So, what happens is we lose ourselves into form association. That's the key. We become deeply associated into the form of, in this case, being human and having a brain and having a brain that limits how you can think and all that good stuff. Or we get associated with our beliefs or the story. You know, "I am so-and-so's friend. That's my identity now." Well, that's okay. That's valuable, actually. It's just that the form falls away. You know, like, as a very simple metaphor, like, where is the five-year-old you? The five-year-old body? Show me your five-year-old self. Well, it's gone completely. There's not a cell left from the five-year-old you, but you're still here. Well, it's like that, actually, too. When the body dies, it's actually not a big deal. The body is actually more like a very, very dense local constraint set, like a suit that we are wearing. And when the body dies, it just drops, and it's a seamless transition because you remain your consciousness before death and after death, and you're still you, except now, when you drop the body, you're much more you because you just dropped all these bunch of constraints that you're not.<br>So, anyway, I went down a bit of a tangent there. I don't know if that speaks to your question.<br>I think I need to think about it a little more. It might. Yeah, I know that's a big—yeah, I think it might even in a way answer my second question, and that's what I mean. I have to think about it a little more. So, for most of my life, I've been much more comfortable in what people call the spiritual world than I am comfortable in whatever this place is we are now. And so, my question is, where the hell are we now?<br>Okay, just two comments. First of all, when you said, "I need to think about it just a little," in case this helps later, nudge—I was a big thinker up until I realized that my human thinking meant almost nothing. Like, because the thinking is the thought form of the local system, so it's like staring into the video game and then trying to understand outside the game with the video game thoughts. Like, fortunately, we're already outside of the game, so actually, dropping thought—which meditation, of course, is the name of that practice—but it's more about alertness rather than thinking about it like a new activity of dropping thought. It's more like returning to full alertness. And when we do that, you ask, "Where are we?"<br>Okay, so I can only use a metaphor. Well, before I use the metaphor, so there is—I know this is going to sound really, really wonky, out there, strange—there is no such thing as distance. There's only the illusion of distance that is occurring because of the sense data we're receiving in consciousness that makes it look like there's all this space. In fact, consciousness is what you are, and it is connected to all other consciousness. Okay? So, metaphorically, a better way to probably more practical way to put that is we're like sitting in the movie theater looking, watching a movie right now. And when you sit in a movie theater and watch a movie, pretty soon, you don't think about the room you're in anymore because you got lost in the movie. It's exciting, it's stimulating, it's got action, there's like characters talking to each other, and it's provoking emotions and story and meaning and all that good stuff, right? That's kind of like what the human experience is like. We get really lost in this rich story that we're coming up with, but we're actually still in the theater. Like, there is no movie world, really. There's only a screen, and there's an image appearing on it. And in this case, the screen is your consciousness itself.<br>And there's information and thoughts, and when you let go of the sense information and the thoughts, it's like returning to awareness of being the person sitting in the movie theater. And all of a sudden, you go, "Oh, it's a movie." Not because you're trying—you don't like sit there and think, "I'm going to think harder and get out of the movie." No, it's by letting go of the movie, and all of a sudden, you realize, "I never left the theater. I've been sitting in the theater the whole time. Holy crap." You know? That is what the awakening process is like. So, where are we? We're not actually in the physical. We're just having—this is a virtual experience, you put it that way. The physical is a virtual experience. And so, to put it in crude, clunky terms, we're in heaven right now having the dream of Earth. It's a way to put it.<br>There's some astrophysicists that are saying this is all the hologram that we're experiencing now. It's a little hard to wrap your mind around because we're so focused on the physical reality that we're in, but it's interesting to see some of these theories emerging. Yeah, we try to understand from the perspective of the physical stuff that we learned locally, and then we run into these things called paradoxes because we've believed duality, whereas that which is real transcends it. It's not a fundamentally real thing. So, you're going to get goofy corners in thinking if you try to think only your way out of the box. Fortunately, your consciousness is already connected to the all-knowing, so you can know. It's just not—you're not going to sit down and read a book and like, "There's the answers." That's not how it works.<br>Which was the biggest challenge, by the way, in writing a book because there's no way to do it. So, it's about—so my book is actually about pointing back towards the "I" in the theater somehow and helping the reader hopefully find that one idea that will nudge them back towards the person that's in the theater.<br>Yeah, I'd like to go back to this being, this non-physical entity that you met. Yeah, I assume that there were a lot of non-physical entities that you've interacted with, and that this one just happened to be an experience that came along that captured your imagination in ways that other interactions didn't. Is that a fair—?<br>Yeah, that's true. Well, that's true, but I'm also super veiled right now still, even though I have some pre-birth memory that's returned. So, I don't have—thank goodness—full access to all that stuff, but yes, there are many, many, many, many, many, many beings, and only a very small percentage incarnate physically, and only a very, very, very small percentage are here on Earth. It'd be like if you go to Mount Everest, and everyone there is climbing Mount Everest, okay? And then you're like, "It's cold up here. There's like no oxygen. This is crazy. Look at—there's like, you know, 50 of us walking up this mountain. Is that a good representation of the whole of the population of Earth?" No, it's a relatively small minority of people that are—I'm not being critical, but crazy enough in the playful sense—crazy enough to go climb Mount Everest. That's like us spiritually. Okay? We are bold enough, courageous enough to dive this deep into the experience of separation. This is madness to come this far into separation and then see what we can do. It's alien as heck. This is a super alien experience.<br>I'm not surprised when Bruce says, you know, "I've always felt kind of more like—I don't know what I'm hearing Bruce say between the lines is, 'I don't even know what that place is, but I'm more called there than here.'" You know, we all kind of feel like that because this is an alien experience, and even though we're veiled and we don't fully remember that at the human level most of the time, it's the soul knowing, like, "This is strange stuff." So, this is like extreme sports. Being human is like extreme sports. Not everybody goes and does extreme sports, but there are a few who do.<br>So, anyway, yes, many beings who do not necessarily take this on, but this being that I came across had—it's interesting because I actually—so I shared my experience like I said about six years or so ago, and then two or three years ago, I heard Bob Monroe say something very similar to what I shared, and I never heard anybody say. He said—Bob Monroe is an out-of-body explorer who founded the Monroe Institute—and in one of his books, he says something like, "For many of us, the reason we initially incarnate is we encounter a graduate, that is someone who has actually mastered the Earth experience, and their spiritual capability and depth is so profound that we say, 'I'll do anything to know that, to be that, to be able to do that, to be that.'" I don't know how to describe it. That's such an important idea, but it's really hard to describe. But here we are. So, like, I—you know, that's what gets me excited is we are here right now. Like, the opportunity is right now. This is not a big hopeless pain fest. Okay? This is a huge opportunity today. Like, what are we going to do with today? How can we choose joy and love today?<br><br><br>Oh my gosh, I remember Robert Monroe in one of his books. He talks about two non-physical beings that are traveling through the non-physical universe or through the universe, and they—in this, it's like a tour group—and they come across this place called Earth. Yeah, and one of the two of them decided, "Hey, I want to go down and try that." It's like, uh, like they drove by an amusement park, and this guy liked what he saw in that amusement park, so he went down to experience it. The other one didn't have an interest in that, yeah, but he could watch what his buddy was going through. And yeah, it came to the end of that buddy's life, and the second guy was looking forward to his friend coming back so they can continue their non-physical life together. Yes, but the guy came back, and he said, "No, I want to do it again." And he kept going back in to have more experience.<br>Yeah, to the consternation of the other guy who wanted to just move on, let's leave this Earth behind. So, I find myself thinking, is this kind of your second go-round? The first one was just a fetus that you—I've actually—I don't know with the detail, but I know that I've lived many times. This is definitely not just my second go-round. Okay, at least hundreds.<br>Well, that clears up another question for me. I was thinking, you seem to be a pretty spiritually evolved person, and if this was your first incarnation, how could you make that kind of leap in your evolution? That sounds like—I have no claim. I have fear like everybody else. That's all I know. But I just know that I've had other physical experiences. I don't see—like, what part of us wants to know, "Am I evolved?" That's ego. So, it's fine. Like, we all are where exactly where we are, but yeah, so I mean, I know I've had many physical experiences. I know I only am certain of at least one other human experience. I know I was a human woman who had given birth, and after the giving—the labor process was really painful, and in being so, then I got pregnant again, and I remember having fear because I knew that the second birth was coming, and I basically couldn't avoid the pain because the fear that I'm here to process is something like inability, powerlessness to escape pain. That's like the main nature of the fear that I'm here to process.<br>So, I experienced the same fear in a different context in that life. This life, it's more around health challenges that I've had. So, the context might be different, but the fear energy is the same. Somehow, these experiences though are perceived as a benefit when you're in that non—go back to a non-physical. You chose to do these experiences because it was going to somehow contribute to the quality of your non-physical life.<br>Yes, yeah, we wouldn't do it unto itself. Actually, not that—not that this isn't wonderful. It's just we—we like, we wouldn't do the physical—we wouldn't sign up for this level of constraints unto itself. It wouldn't make sense. It just wouldn't make sense to do that.<br>So, that seems to indicate that there—and when we're in our non-physical form, we're striving for something more. And I don't know what that is. You know, some people say that you reach a point where you don't need to incarnate anymore, and there's another level of being in the non-physical that you can't access until you've learned enough lessons here on Earth to be able to—I mean, I think now let's turn a little bit to the out-of-body side.<br>Well, let me please comment on that because there's a couple of things there you said that are really important. So, first of all, I think it's important—this is a subtle comment because just with your subtle thing on your word usage—when you said, "When we are in the non-physical state," okay, we are only non-physical. I know that like that sounds crazy, but like we've got to get our foundations right, and the physical is occurring in the non—like, basically, you are you. You're not someone else. You know, when you're out of the body, you're you. You're exactly you. Like, the you that feels like you to you is who you are. Okay? Now, but like as a metaphor here on Earth, like let's say you when you have a flu and you're vomiting in a toilet, you don't feel as you. You don't feel as full of you as when you say are vibrant and healthy, right? It's similar to being free of the body. It's like you're still you. It's just you're much, much freer.<br>So, okay, so the you that is growing, expanding is the same you. Like, the you that's here right now, like it's not some other being using the human you as a puppet. It's you. Like, that's really important because we tend to get grumpy and say, "Well, my soul is using me, and I'm pissed. I don't like this experience." Okay, if you don't like it, then you don't like it. Why? Like, go into the rejection. What is—what where is the fear? You know, that's the kicker. Okay? So, now that expansion of being—I've like spent 10 years thinking about how to describe it because it's the thing we're doing. Like, at least from my experience, it's like why I came, you know? And the book is an attempt—every—it's just terrible. It fails so many in so many ways, but it's an attempt to use language to describe that.<br>But I'll just—but to say, but so I'll use some metaphors. Like, I understand why the great teachers of history have always used metaphors. There's no way to use language. Okay? So, this is a simple metaphor, but I think it's a good metaphor. If you're sitting on a couch watching television, and you've got good access to the snacks, and you're content and comfortable, and you've got your pizza or whatever you like, you know, you've got your drink or whatever, why would you ever go outside and go for a run? Like, why would you put yourself through stress? Why would you do that? Because you strengthen your body, gain health, and when you come back to the couch, you can actually appreciate it. You can appreciate even the snacks in a way that you couldn't before. You see, because now you have a contrast for the couch.<br>The physical experience is like the ultimate contrast. And so, what that means is it's like lifting weights. So, you might say to somebody, "Why the heck would you ever lay down and lift 50 pounds instead of 100 or 20 instead of—or 50 instead of 20? Go the other direction. Why would you ever lift 50 instead of 20 pounds? Why? That doesn't make any sense. Why would you put yourself through that? That doesn't make any sense." Because the greater the contrast, the more the growth potential through it. Now, just like 50 pounds on a bar, it doesn't do it by itself. Like, the weight will not lift itself. It's just weight. And the physical is just dense, dense, super dense, dense, dense, dense form, consistent, persistent, super linear time, super sense of separation, neutral form that we then put meaning on. It's very rigorous, very limiting. That's up. It's just limiting. It's not bad. It's limiting. That level of limitation is like lifting a thousand pounds.<br>Now, how do we actually lift the thousand pounds rather than just get crushed by it to death? You know, we—and this is so hard to describe because what I'm trying—what I want to talk about is quality of intention. Quality of intention means what is the real why you're making the choices you're making. Is it love? And is it from love and authenticity and freedom and creativity and joy? Or is it from fear and protectiveness and ego and rejection and us versus them and "I'm going to make sure I'm safe, and I don't like that. I'm going to run away"? It's not a judgment. It's just what is the quality of your intention? And we have such a limiting situation going on here on Earth, and we've had thousands of years of fear-based intentionality enshrined in our history. Okay? And our whole society is built on us versus them ideas and control of resources. Like, our whole society. So, it's pretty crazy.<br>So, in the midst of all that though, what quality of intention can you wield? Can you actually choose a little bit more love, compassion, kindness, service to others, joy, simple joy? Like, you could sit on your front lawn and appreciate the sunset and accomplish more than making a million dollars. Like, it's not about moving virtual objects around. You don't get to keep the virtual objects. You don't get to keep the money. You don't get to keep the body. But what you keep is you and your quality of intention wielding capability. You see? And if you can wield a quality of intention in dense circumstances, how much more can you do that when it's not dense?<br>So, if you can lift 100 pounds, and you do it every day for a whole lifetime, and by the time you're done, you're pretty strong, and you go to the non-physical, and in that reality, maybe this is a metaphor—things weigh half a pound, and you're like, "This is nothing. I just picked this something, throw this down the street." You know? And they're like, "Wow, how did you do that?" And you're like, "Dude, this is nothing. This is nothing compared to the denseness that I experienced on Earth." You see? And so, then once we've experienced that denseness, we may—we don't have to choose to come back. We may say, "You know what? I there's something about that weight, that denseness, that contrast that is valuable that I would like to re-experience or some new strength I'd like to develop." Right? Because it's not just one strength. You could say this is crude language, and I don't mean this literally, but it's like every virtue is its own strength. Can you learn kindness? Can you learn self-referencing? It's a big spiritual strength we come to learn, which is can you rely on yourself instead of everyone around you? Actually, when you need to, like higher realities, you don't really have to do that. We're all connected. We hold each other up all the time. Like, so to come here though, where you have to rely on yourself, wow, that's like, wow, that's actually a strength.<br><br><br>Or it could be the ability to wield creativity within a certain temperature of context. Like, we don't think of that as a spiritual strength, but to the creative soul, like the ability to even do something creative might be a very meaningful strength to grow. So, when we talk about lessons, it's not intellectual learning lessons. It's being-level experiential growth lessons. It's being-level lessons. It's a change of the quality of being through how we respond to contrast.<br>So, before I pose my more questions, does anybody else want—I don't want to—the question period here.<br>Mark, hi, Christian. Hi, I've really enjoyed what you were saying, and I can identify with a lot of the things you said. One of the questions that I had was you talked about metaphors for everything. Would it help to have a scientific paradigm that could describe the basis or the foundations for a lot of the things you talk about to maybe help give people a sense to where you can wrap everything up in a nice neat package?<br>Yeah, that would be really nice, and there are some who have tried. For instance, Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer, he has a very dry, very clinical but helpful metaphor set. But again, it's metaphors. And the reason it has to be metaphors is because you can't start with the non-fundamentally real local and explain from there. It'd be like going into Minecraft, the video game, where everything is a bunch of blocks, and then trying to explain our world from the only using Minecraft blocks. You just can't do it. It's not built into the Minecraft block. Like, they don't—they can't do it because they're the lower dimension. Like, they are the non-native set of forms. So, the physical is like that, and so we can't start. So, our science right now is very focused on—well, materialism, which eventually we're going to figure out is not correct. Materialism is—it seems like it seems logical on the surface, very in very basic terms, but matter itself only exists as an experience and within consciousness. So, we'll eventually get there, and when we do, there's a great quote from Nikola Tesla. He said something like, "In the decade that the first decade that our science begins to study the non-physical, we will learn more in one decade than in all the previous years of science's existence." And so, I agree 100%. Like, yes, yes, we need to turn our human effort and our study in that direction. I'm just commenting though that it's also that this really cannot be limited to a local set of language. It's really like when you experience it personally, you discover why you can't say it. Like, yeah, I don't know how else to put it.<br>Right, and I think a lot of people have an intellectual understanding of things, but you can't really understand it until you have the experience, until you have the experiential knowledge as well to couple with it or to have it independently of—<br>Agreed. So, there's two levels that I want to point out there. Like, one is the human thinking mind based only on Earth-learned ideas cannot understand. However, that does not mean you can't understand. It's a very important distinction because you are soul. You are consciousness, so you do have the ability to fully comprehend and know. It's just not going to happen by sitting down and playing with local non-fundamental objects as if they were real and looking back up from here. You know, not fully. I mean, we can do it in metaphor set. It's like you actually—"A Walk in the Physical," my book, is an attempt to do that. It's part one of the book is 14 pages where I'm trying to say in 14 pages what is the physical experience, and then those 14 pages point to the rest of the book, and there's a Q&amp;A section organized by topic where I try to speak to every major question because I'm trying to organize it in a way that's more referential even though I say it was more spirit's idea because if I was going to write it, I would just do it much more linearly, but it's much more referential. It's much more nonlinear. It's like this points to this. You can go over here now, go over here now, and then as a total, it hopefully helps start to paint a picture because it can't be done in a set of language.<br>Yeah, well, thank you.<br>Yeah, I have a question on out-of-body experience. Have you read books on the subject? Jurgen Ziewe? Not too much. I've read a little Jurgen Ziewe, and I've read a little bit of Bob Monroe, but not too much. I'm not super interested in reading other people's experiences. I'd rather meditate.<br>So, let me pose a question to you. See if you have a perspective on this. Yeah, I remember which one it was, but in repetitive out-of-body experiences, the idea is that they leave the physical reality behind, and they're now in a non-physical environment. And on some excursions—what's call it, just using a word—into that non-physical, they are in a vibrational state that is fairly low vibration. Yeah, and they meet entities that, for example, don't know how to fly and are just captivated when he shows that they can fly. And forgotten—Bill Buhlman talks about when he doesn't like being in a particular vibratory state, he'll say, "Higher vibration now," and he then—I don't know whether I don't want to use the word "ascend," but he moves into a state where the entities that he meets seem to be more evolved. And I'm wondering—okay, more evolved only from a standpoint of they can do more things. The nature of their interactions with one another are more loving and uplifting. There's less fear. Yeah, let's just say a higher vibrational experience, not more evolved because there are some extremely highly evolved beings here on Earth that are having some extremely low vibration experiences.<br>Yeah, yeah. So, does that resonate with you, the idea that in the non-physical, there can be—I mean, when you talk, you talked about meeting that highly evolved being, and yet you've had multiple life experiences. It tends to indicate that there is a growth that goes on through this experience, and that growth can become evident in the way when you interact with others in a soul environment.<br>So, that's second. I'll speak to the second comment first. So, yes, because in higher environments, we are connected right now too, actually. Like, every one of us is connected to each other. We may not visually see it or feel it or understand it at the human level, but we are connected. If I think about someone in this chat with a focused intention, I will be touching their consciousness even if you can't perceive it. So, in higher systems where we're not limited, we feel and know that connectedness. So, the nature of the other is seen and known.<br>I guess I'll just go on a tangent for a second and just tell a very brief story that I had an out-of-body experience one time. So, okay, so at the time that I had this experience, I was not a fan of my wife's ex-boyfriend at the human level. I had a silly ego thing going on, but I had this out-of-body experience where I felt and saw his soul—who he really was, who he is—and it was so beautiful and so rich and full of color and full of purpose, and I felt how his nature and my wife's nature overlapped in this very beautiful way, and I felt how his nature and my nature overlapped in a completely different but also very beautiful way. The way they overlapped was they shared a—oh, language is so bad—a creative mastery, I'll call it. I mean, we're all creative, but they were both on like creative missions, like that kind of thing. And then he and I shared what I would call a deep ancient honor. Like, we were both beings who valued honor as a concept and as an actualized thing, and I really resonated with him on that, and I could feel what he was doing in this life and how he was like Plato that had been run over by a car tire, and he was squashed. And what that meant was he had experienced no love as a child. Like, he wasn't nurtured, so he was basically handicapped from no love. Like, and he had—and then from that squashed state of being, he was—he is now in this life trying to create from the squashed position.<br>So, I'm just sharing that as an example because I could see and feel and know all that in a second. Like, it wasn't like hard because his nature—his soul and my soul—but we're also the part of the one, and so I could feel from him what I am. Okay? So, in higher systems, yes, when we interact with—so depending on the limitations of the system, okay? So, like here in the physical, we don't typically experience at a conscious level telepathy. That's not typical. Like, most people don't go walking down the street telling each other things in their minds. This is not Earth because the limitations are so high. We just have to talk to each other. We have to make sounds, and like I have to speak into this microphone. It has to catch the vibrations, which are symbols that you know, and then you have to figure like it's so crude. It's ridiculous.<br><br><br>But if you go to systems with less limitation, the less—the higher vibration, which generally is synonymous with less limitation, the higher you go because the limitation is less, the connectedness and the knowing of it is more. And so, because it's more, we absolutely can feel from those beings we interact with who they are, what they're doing, their nature, and we love each other by the way for exactly the unique nature that each one of us is and is offering. And that was one thing I felt at the IONS conference I was to go to—down in Far a path, but the IONS conference at Washington DC felt like a little bit of that where everybody was just celebrating each other, and it was freaking beautiful.<br>Okay, so that was the second part of your comment about interacting with beings. Now, meanwhile, your comment about vibration and lower vibrational non-physical realms—yes, so feel physical when you're there, really physical depending on the system, but like there's a—okay, so Earth is an extremely low vibration place because of the density, but also because of the fear that we all have here. So, we're creating this kind of temperature that is not real high levels. It's pretty mucky. It's like a loud playground where people are throwing mud at each other all day. You know, there are other non-physical layers. I just call it lower astral realms for lack of a better term. I'm not—I don't know much about how to label them all, but there are lower astral realms that are very close vibrationally to Earth but slightly less limiting, but they're still thought-responsive manifestations of the vibrations that we are entertaining here on Earth. So, thought form can be seen and felt and known there, but the astral itself has many layers of vibration. You can go to very high-level, very high vibration realms that are much closer to our true nature.<br>So, I don't know if that speaks to your question.<br>Try to give other—there we are. Apostle, clap. Hello, hello, hello, hello. Good to see you. Hey, brother, how are you? Fine. Just I want to give you a hug. I want to give you a hug, man. I want to give you a hug as well, and that is no lie. I just want to say thank you. I'm about to go in tears. Oh no, it's okay. But I just want to thank you for sharing your experience because it gave so much confirmation to my walk. I've always had this inside of me. I would be in church, and you know, my pastor and all would say, "You know, we were created by God," and all this inside of me saying, "I was never created. I've always been." And I could never ever even to this day—but it's such—words can't do justice to the frequency that I feel when I that statement. But you have just confirmed so much to me, and especially about quality of intention.<br>Oh, oh, oh my. Oh, thank you so much, man. Just thank you for being. Thank you, brother, and our path will cross. That's for sure. I would love to have—beautiful. I can't wait. I can't wait to live. Love to have him on my Facebook live. Oh my God. Okay, let's do it. Let's do it. Oh, I'm sorry, Jim. This—thank you. When I see—kiss you for this night. Awesome. Do it. Let's do it. I'm excited. We're seeing you. I love love. So, I know I'm a normal person too, but I love love. I'll give anybody a hug anytime. I love it. Yes, yes. Come to Phoenix Memorial or Labor Day weekend. Yeah, I'll be—we'll be in Phoenix. Are you going to be there, Jim, this year? I will. I'll be at the conference. Yeah, that's awesome. Cool.<br>Yeah, I would echo what you said earlier. The—I've been to one, two, three IONS conferences now, and it's a fascinating feeling you get when you walk into this thing. There is so much love flowing around. It's true, and it's a—for me, it's a reminder where we all came from. You know, we don't get a chance to experience that depth of respect and love for one another in our normal lives, but when I go to that conference because the majority of people have had a near-death experience and have traveled back to our native realms, and what the stories they bring back—you know, it's there's some interesting research that shows—it was referenced in Bruce Greyson's book after—they did some research in some universities where students who get exposed to near-death experiences have shifts in their attitudes and values. And I think that in some ways, that's what we're trying to do with Consciousness Cafe, inviting people like you to speak. It's inspirational, and the more comfortable people get with understanding who they are and being able to talk about that, it just builds.<br>I have a person close to me who had psychic abilities but didn't understand what they were until she came to a Consciousness Cafe gathering. She thought it was a—she had a mental health problem, and when she talked to others, they said, "No, you know, you're just empathic like me. Let me give you some tips on how to control that." I mean, the quality of her life is significantly better because of that sharing. And my hope is that more of us will get comfortable and talk about what you heard tonight. I met this—I heard this guy, Christian Sundberg, talk about his decision to come in and have a physical experience. Yeah, a lot of people say, "What are you talking about?" I know. Well, the more comfortable we get talking about those things, I also have talked with many people here about after-death communications. There's some that came out in the Journal of Near-Death Studies that maybe 30% of our population has had an after-death communication, but we don't talk about it because we have a culture that says that's not real. Yeah, but I found that when I talk to people about it and I give them safe space, then these stories come out, and people are thankful to be sharing in that. So, absolutely, here, take what Christian talked about and feel free to talk about this stuff. The more open we are, the greater this awakening, the faster the pace of this awakening that I think we're working towards.<br>Yeah, I agree with that 100%. I'm very passionate about normalizing it because it's real. Like, this is not like just a religious thing or a woo-woo, like new age or whatever. Like, it's—we are multi-dimensional beings. Like, it really is real. So, like, I'm a very down-to-earth type person. I'm a project manager by trade. I use my left brain all day. You know, I'm logical. I'm down-to-earth, and I feel like we can share these things with each other in a very non-judgmental, open, vulnerable way. Like, yes, absolutely. And one of the greatest blessings I've experienced personally is after sharing, so many people have reached out who have had experiences that are similar—some very similar to mine—and they're not alone. Like, I mean, I've probably met 50 other pre-birth experiencers by now. That's a lot, and every one of them thinks they're the only one on the planet. You know what I mean? And I'm like, "No, you're normal. You're fine. Like, this is real, and we can normalize that and take the stigma away." It's like we can get closer to communicating in that way and connecting in that way. That's why I love that IONS conference so much. It was just—I mean, I couldn't get 10 feet without a hug or someone giving a—not a reading, but just like sharing energy with each other. And oh, it was amazing.<br>Anyway, so I applaud that. My kids—they're 14 and 12 now. Last year when we went—I guess they were 14 and 12 both still when we went last year—and did they get—they get something out of participating? I mean, I don't know that to my surprise, they did. I say that because I thought that they would not enjoy it as much as they did. Yeah, they did enjoy it. They're coming this year too.<br>Better understanding of who you are as a result of hearing—I think so. I do think so. I mean, in my house, it's kind of a normal conversation topic. They're teenagers, so they're kind of sick of hearing about it kind of thing. You know, "Okay, we know we're not human, and Dad, I'm going to go play with my friends now." That's totally fine. Like, we're here to do that. That's fine.<br>Yeah, yeah. I have a—my just turned 95 yesterday, and it's interesting to compare the generation differences. You know, oh yes. There are so many constraints on her generation about what was acceptable to the point where I remember her telling me her parents would be aghast if she dated an Italian man. Yeah, you think about how constraining that is. Oh my gosh, we have so much convention. Yeah, so I'm excited about how—you know, if you look at the trajectory of things, I think young people today are coming in more aware or a greater maybe set a greater potential for awareness, and what we have to do is help them understand that all the negative things you see around you—the things we need to work on, the environment, political discourse, a lot of—but if that's all you think that your life is about, you know, how depressing that is. And I think we can open them up to something more, and there's a purpose to this. Then you start accepting you have a role in this. You can—if you want to change it, then you can change it.<br>Absolutely. There was another topic you mentioned before tonight that I thought I'd jump to because you had asked before that we touch on it, and that is how do we process fear? So, I'll jump right over to that just for the sake of time. So, we're here to grow in love, simply put, and processing our fear is synonymous with growing in love. So, it's very important that we do it because that quality of intention that we talk about—when we have fear, we end up making a lot of choices from the fear, from ego, and rejection that just rises from fear. So, fear is the real problem. You know, people say, "Well, anger is the problem or hatred is the problem." Not really. I mean, like, those are surface manifestations. At the root of it, there's fear. Like, if you look deep enough, you'll find you're afraid. Okay? So, that's like a huge topic, and I don't mean to just make a super casual comment to it, but I just lift up one idea that I thought I would share tonight.<br>Okay, so fear always arises when we buy into a negative self-perception or a negative perception about the world that is not in alignment with the truth. So, if I perceive I am powerless, the truth is I'm a powerful being. Like, that's what I really am. But if I fall asleep into actually perceiving, "Wow, this circumstance is super proving to me that I'm powerless," that might provoke fear because now I'm buying into a perception that is vibrationally not what I really am. Then what happens is when we have those fears, we don't like that, and the ego does its number one job, which is to avoid it, cover it up, justify it away, you know, come up with some new thing, new strategy, new belief, new substance, new person, new activity, new distraction—something just as long as I don't look at that fear that's down there. And then we double down on that 700 times, you know, and by the time we get to be adults, we're like so fearful and ego-ridden, we don't know what to do.<br><br><br>Okay, so the thing is that this sounds backwards, okay, but the way then to process fear is not to avoid it but to go into it, towards it. That doesn't mean you have to go looking for it. Life is going to lift stuff up to you, and like if you're here to process something, you will get a chance. Don't worry. Like, you don't have to be a masochist about it. But when something happens and it provokes fear, okay, be very alert and allow yourself to actually go into the fear and feel it and not reject it. Don't reject the feeling. Don't reject the sensation. Your mind will immediately come up with stories. Oh, but the story, stories. I'm actually not talking about the stories. Put the stories away for a minute. Just put them on the shelf. The feeling itself—what am I rejecting? Where is my rejection? What is the really, really, really terrifying negative self-perception because it's down there somewhere? I'm powerless, or I'm unworthy of love, shame—that's another huge one on Earth—or I'm not free. Those are some of the really big perceptions.<br>When those get triggered, allow ourselves to fully feel the present moment, and then what happens is when you allow it and fully feel it, feel it to heal it. The light of your awareness automatically—because now you're choosing your intention is no longer to run away. So, your intention changes. When your intention is to say yes to it and to feel it, it automatically processes it. Fear's like a messenger arriving to your front door, and the messenger is like wrapping at your door, "Hey, you have this negative self-perception. Boo." And you're like, "No, go away. I don't like that." And you shut the door. It comes back, and it wraps a little harder, and it wraps a little harder. Getting rid of fear is not about getting rid of it like it's not about like, "Oh, I don't like you, messenger, so in order to get rid of you, I'm going to listen to what you have to say." That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about actually let that guy in for long, sit in my living room. Would you like some tea and biscuits? Tell me what you're here to tell me. Like, deliver what is the negative actual feeling of rejected my whole life. And when you're honest and genuine about actually feeling that crap like all the way, it will process. It will heal. It may feel like it will destroy you, but it won't. It will not destroy you. It's about having such willingness that you're even willing to potentially be destroyed where you won't. That's how much willingness it might take to face our deepest fears.<br>So, I'm sharing that because my physical journey in this life is about facing fear, and I had post-traumatic stress in my 20s. I processed a huge amount of that. I no longer have the symptomology of that, and I just know that like there was this clever phrase written on the chalkboard of my counselor in my 20s that I thought was just insult at the time and just stimulated my ego the wrong way, and I thought it was BS, but it turns out to be quite literally true. And the sentence is, "Power lies in accepting powerlessness." So, when the powerlessness arises in your life in whatever form, can you accept it? Can you say yes to this moment anyway? Can you keep your eyes open, feel it all the way? Man, that willingness is the active ingredient that I want to lift up. I mean, this topic is a big topic. We could talk about this topic for 10 hours, but just in five minutes, I'm just lifting up this idea that when fear arises, it's okay if we don't run away from it, and if we actually allow this moment to show us what we're believing about it.<br>Like, if five weeks ago, I was in a car accident. Somebody hit me from behind and totaled my car, and I had minor injury. I went to the ER. I couldn't focus my eyes at first, had a headache. So, I'm in the ER, and I'm feeling very shocked, and I can't think quite clearly, and they're about to do a bunch of tests on me, which in the past is something I haven't really enjoyed. When you're in an experience that like you just got hit by a car, it's violent. You know, it's loud. It's very, very visceral, very deep. It doesn't feel light. And so, because that's the level of the rigor of the physical stimulus we might receive, it might be pain. It might be—maybe you're vomiting when you have the flu. Maybe you have a chronic illness, and you have pain every day. Maybe you're wrestling with the idea of chronic illness that you can't escape. That's its own hell. Whatever it is, how do we handle that object? And meditation, by the way, can be extremely helpful and empowering because it separately allows us to develop a space from which we can see these very important thoughts more clearly.<br>So, like, you know, in the ER, like, "Okay, I feel shocked. I'm about to get some tests. It's okay. I feel very strongly right now. That's okay. That's okay. I feel strongly. You know, I can't think right now. That seems like a problem. That's okay. If I can't think, why is that? Why does that mean? Why does the meaning have to be a problem? If I can't think, why? That doesn't have to be a problem." You see, we are always assigning the meaning. We're always doing something. The ego wants to do something with the object and the story and the sense and fix it somehow. Can we shift and allow and say, "You know what? I'm not going to make an enemy of this moment because, like Cliff Notes ending here again, the universe is not your enemy. Life is not your enemy. I know that here in the physical, we see blood and death, trauma, lack, violence, ubiquitous misunderstanding, ubiquitous ego activities. I know that's what we see on the surface, but what meaning are we applying? We are the authors. Like, what are we doing with it?"<br>Yeah, anyway, I just want to lift that up because you mentioned that before our conversation today that it would be good to touch on.<br>Yeah, let's see if anybody else has any questions. I'd like to explore—we're an hour and 15 minutes into this almost.<br>Where can I get this book at? It's available for free online at the third link down on my website. It's called "A Walk in the Physical." So, that's if you want to read it online. It's also on Amazon in print and Kindle, and I did record the audiobook. That was fun, but I got it to pass, so it's on Audible too. "A Walk in the Physical." I'll put it in the chat, but yeah, it's available to be read online for free. It's not about money. I don't care about the money. I just want to share. There's the website. I just typed it. I think that went to everybody. Yeah, yep.<br>Well, if we don't have more questions—oh, we do have one. Go ahead, Sharon. Thanks for raising your hand.<br>You have to unmute yourself.<br>Hello, is that better? Yeah, there you go. Ah, thank you. I'm fascinated by this whole subject. I watch a lot of NDEs, and I watched a video of Christian earlier, so I'm just really into this, and I'm curious about what are some of the other lessons we come here to learn?<br>Yes, so that there's such a high quantity of answers possible that I couldn't even start because the soul is extremely vast in its qualities and knowing. And so, because the soul is so vast, there are so many different angles of experience we might come to learn or even just services we might come to perform. We might come to be physical just to like be friends with someone for 10 minutes they really need it that we love them, and we know that we could be there for them in a unique way that they really need. Like, we could do just that, or it could be a multitude of things. I mean, like, life is not just one thing. It's a complex, rich experience. So, boy, there's so many different things we can learn. We could basically say that any virtue is worth exploring. Any creative power is worth exploring. Our native qualities like freedom, love, joy—all the many aspects of freedom, love, and joy are worth exploring and understanding. So, boy, it could be so many different things.<br>I'll just say one thing though. Like, the soul—when the soul has a goal, it might not make a super lot of sense to the human personality because we tend to think, "Oh, I want these big, broad, really cool, you know, easy-to-understand goals." But our nature is very unique and very specific, and like something that you come to experience and learn might be such a specific angle of something that like I couldn't even conceive of it. You see? Oh, how important is it to be active in the world? It's very important to be active in the world, but it's also—but okay, so our effect on the world is not entirely dependent on our activity though. Like, we affect the world just by what's going on in our own consciousness because consciousness is affect. So, we're all one part of one pond. So, when you shift your consciousness, you are affecting the whole pond. So, I'm encouraging that first because it's not like you need—like, we don't have to—okay, like this is a double-edged sword here, but I'm saying you don't have to do anything. Like, consciousness, nothing is actually required of consciousness at the deepest level. At the same time, as we seek to actualize and express love and overcome fear, like when we really know that we are unconditionally loved—unconditionally bold, italicized, underline the "un" part—unconditionally loved, that means also like and there's nothing required of us there. In that, there is total freedom.<br><br><br>Okay, so in that freedom, when we find that love, then loving intention means action. So, a loving intention means we will take some action to those around us. Like, if you intend to do something, you will do it. So, but that doesn't have to be big either. Like, it doesn't have to be you have to like save a thousand people in a crash or something. Like, if you smile at the person in the grocery store or just are genuine in some small way, like the size is actually not what's critical. What's key is the quality of the intention itself. You see? It's not the size. Like, we're so focused on doing here on Earth. Like, we're so focused on the money and who's got what objects and where the objects are today and who's wielding what force. Dude, all of that is temporary and virtual. Like, the thing that's real is quality of intention.<br>There's one near-death experience I read that I really love. I forget the name of this person every time, and I apologize, but this person had a life review, and in their life review, they saw that the most celebrated moment of their life was when they were a child, and their family stopped at a rest area, and their family asked this person to fill up this bucket of water at a stream for their family. So, they went down to a stream, and they filled up this bucket of water, and they were carrying this heavy bucket, and they saw a dry tree over on the side a little bit out of the way, and the person went out of their way and went and watered that dry tree and then continued on their way, never thought about it again. But because—but that act, they did it completely just from unconditional love. There was no benefit. It wasn't about size. It was just quality. It was just this tree needs water. You see? And they didn't even think about it again. They never even remembered that they took that action, but it was so celebrated because the purity of that of their intention in that moment. We all can do that. Like, we don't have to go and solve all the problems in the world. If we just bring love to bear and joy to bear in whatever small way, the small stuff is the big stuff. It's one of the names of the one of the essays in my book is called "The Small Stuff is the Big Stuff." That's what I mean is like those small actions—even if there's they could be big actions too, of course—but I just mean actions that are motivated by love are valuable for their own sake, and those are of course important.<br>Hope that speaks to your question.<br>Oh, yes, absolutely. Thank you. Thank you.<br>Rita, oh, Jim, you're on mute. There's a question in chat. Sorry, my phone went off. I silenced myself. No problem. Should I go to Rita or BNA? Okay, yeah, then we'll come in Rita. Okay, so BNA wrote, "In your opinion, if it is the soul's intention to evolve, why don't we remember our lessons more easily?"<br>So, evolution—I know what it sounds like we're talking about behavior, but we're actually not exactly talking about behavior, and we're not actually even talking about understanding in the intellectual sense. We're talking about quality of being. So, the evolution that is occurring is a quality of the being by being something. It's an integration of experience, and in order to have the human experience, that means forgetting. So, it is in the forgetting. It is in the immersion—it's a good word. It is in the complete and total immersion into the obscured, veiled perspective. It is precisely in that that the opportunity lies. Now, we may remember it. It's possible, you know, because we can let go and stop watching the movie so deeply, or we can evolve and integrate experience such that our deeper nature rises back up to us. But is it necessary that we remember all of who we are? Actually, no, because you're still you. You're still having the experience, and you do retain all of your experience.<br>And actually, there are some—a couple of other practical reasons just very quickly. The veil is actually really necessary for a couple of other reasons. One is it protects us from homesickness because otherwise, we'd be so darn homesick, and we won't be able to get up in the morning. Like, it's ridiculous how high vibration and beautiful our higher nature is. If you want to be the human, you got to—you know, not get distracted. You got to have some veiling. And the second thing is it really allows you to focus on just this activity and just this story without the—I was going to say pollution—it's a bad word—the influence of old ego patterns and previous experiences. So, you get a fresh slate. So, you're still you, and then in this life, you might develop patterns, but you're still you, and it's actually a good thing that that experience is independent. It's a little bit like if you go do one thing on Monday night like go to the movies, and then on Tuesday night, you go play golf. You don't really want to be watching the movie while you're playing golf or playing golf while you're watching the movie. That's a bad metaphor. Like, you want to just be doing that thing that you're doing because it's in that activity of being you the human that you can really learn experientially.<br>I hope that speaks to your question.<br>Yes, thank you. I do enjoy the metaphors. It's very relatable. Thank you.<br>Sure. Sorry, one other thing that came to mind is also I re-read your question, and you said "more easily." So, one other just very technical reason, just totally neutral technical consequence—the deeper we are associated into form, the harder it is to see clearly or remember. So, that is like the more that we really are focused on the thoughts and really focused on the sense data and really focused on the pain, it gets really hard because the veil is just obscuring it. It doesn't actually—it can't actually change that we're connected to everything. All it can do is kind of put like a foggy cloak down so that you can get lost focusing into the form. And then once you get lost focusing into the form, you know, you're not going to see past the fog practically speaking. But if you let go of the form, we can remember more easily.<br>Yeah.<br>There. Yes, thank you for time and sharing your experience. It's so fascinating. I've always felt like I didn't belong here. I always—since very as long as I can remember—and I want to touch on the subject of spirit guides. I've always had the knowing of a spirit guide or a guide, someone guiding me that I would always ask questions, and they would always give me the answers. Can you touch on that subject?<br><br><br>Yeah, we—yeah, we so there are actually more players participating that are not physical than there are physical players. I was just getting a little ping there making sure that—so yes, there are more non-physical players involved with our simulation than there are actors on stage even. And each of us have guides. So, typically, it could be one or a small number of very guides who personally know you really well and have similar energetic awareness and similar maybe qualities, maybe even similar challenges but have a good vantage point, and they can help you. And then there are guides who are more universal, I guess would be a good word, but basically, they're specialized in certain types of work and vibration, and then they might visit during a period where you need that thing. Like, if you're just as an example, if you're dealing with grief and it's a certain flavor of grief, there might be a guide who really understands that and might show up for like a second even—might for us it might seem like a second—it might nudge us in a way to help us just for that, just as an example. But yeah, we do all have personal guides that watch over us throughout life and know us really well.<br>I always felt that. Okay, it's so funny. Every time I would come up with a question, you or someone else would answer it. That's nice. Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you again.<br>You're welcome. Any other questions? Feel free to raise your hand. We don't have to limit this. We go again, Mr. Clap.<br>Yeah, Christian, can we incarnate at will in our—at will? What do you mean by "at will"? You mean now while we're human, or is it an active will? What do you mean by "at will"? That's a good question. Good question. Can we reincarnate or incarnate?<br>Well, so yeah, so I'll make a comment, and then tell me if I don't speak to your question, please. So, let's not confuse the player sitting at the computer chair with the video game character. So, as the video game character in this case, Mr. Clap, Mr. Clap is not really all that you are. You're you. So, if you think you're the human, can that part of you—well, no, that part of you is doing the human thing right now, of course. But meanwhile, the deeper you, the soul-level you, is already beyond the limitations of the physical. And so, in our metaphor, that bigger you can—I know this sounds strange—but can play more than one video game at once. So, it's not limited in the same way that we are. And so, if you as the non-constrained you would like to sit down and play Zelda at the same time, even if in a local linear time system those appear to be different times, that's no problem. The bigger you can do that.<br>Now, there is such a thing as full progression time, so we're getting into topics that are really hard to talk about because we're in linear time, so we're trying to fit our understanding down into this non-fundamentally real system here. But anyway, we can say there's soul progression time, so that you as a being after you are finished with a given life, you look and you're like, "Wow, oh wow, I really learned some stuff. I really—look at that experience I had." <br>You will then make a choice about what to do next, and you will learn and grow, build upon previous experience. So, there's both—so there's both soul evolution sequence, and there's also the one now. Those are not contradictory or paradoxical even though they sound like it from here. That makes sense. Thank you. Thank you. If I didn't answer your question, please hold me in.<br>You did. Okay.<br>You see Rita's question. Oh, is it true we have several lives simultaneously? Yes, so I think my comment I just made directly speaks to that in the best I can, which is that all is occurring within the one now, and that one now everything is also—there's also soul evolution time, and I don't know how—I can't articulate how the two are at the same time, but they're both true, and they just look—it looks wonky from here because we don't like it one of those two things. They don't look right from here, but yes, we—so like you could just say like you're doing other things right now, actually. You don't even have to think of it as several lives right now. <br>Think of it like this: like even when your body sleeps, you're going off and doing things in other systems whether or not you remember it or not. So, you're in—you are multi—when we say we're multi-dimensional beings, that doesn't mean you're just here and then you're just there. It means no, right now, you are multi-dimensional. Yeah, you're just not aware of it because your focus is on exactly because we're watching the movie really deeply. Yeah, yeah.<br>Susan, unmute yourself and pose your question.<br>Yes, um, I was in another meeting, and there was the lady talking about this, and she said that she had this poster behind her, and it was like a sun with all these rays coming out of it. She said that those rays are like parts of your soul, so it could be in different places at the same time, and that's how she explained it. Cool. <br>So, I thought that was really cool. But also, I feel like I've had a lot of lessons to learn in this life because I am so different, and I've learned and changed so much from the beginning of my life to now. There is an issue where I have to be very careful around other people because they can—I can make other people angry really quickly, and I had a star chart done where they said, "You have to look out for that." I'm like, "Yeah, I'm aware of that." Is there something—are there dark parts of your soul? I mean, is there a—is I mean, you said that we're all love and light and joy, but are there dark parts? I mean, is there something that some that people see in me that's dark?<br>Well, without commenting specifically about you, to your first part of your question, okay, so there's two levels here that may sound paradoxical but again aren't. First of all, the fundamental level is that beingness itself is perfect, and it is already love and peace and joy. That is always our true nature. Then we created something that we're not. That the universe and more than one universe—all the universes of form—and we engage universes of form, and as we do, we are only so good, so evolved at actualizing and knowing our true nature in those realities of form. <br>So, the only—there's not a real problem. The only thing we're striving against is what we would call unevolved this. That's it. Unevolving this is synonymous though with fear, and fear is synonymous with all sorts of ego shenanigans, and we might stimulate in others where our own fear is because that's what we do. Like, in the physical especially, we tend to either get what we fear or create what we fear because we're afraid of it. We're actually actualizing it or drawing it to us in a way because we're trying to process. We're trying to grow through that.<br>So, it's not that there's actual darkness, but there is practical darkness, of course, in that we have fear that can be very, very deep and dark and low vibration. Now, even though it's low vibration, we transcend duality itself. Like, the substance of consciousness gave rise to duality. It's not duality isn't even fundamentally real. So, even as we talk about low vibration, high vibration, the fundamental substrate remains what it is. It remains love and peace and joy. <br>That's why, you know, when you hear experiences where people go to like hellish reality systems and there are beings who might be focused into low vibration, the act that helps is to get them to look up, to focus towards the love and the joy and the peace because it's their own focus, their own stickiness with some lower vibrational aspect, some fear, some ego pattern that is why they're there because they're free-willed. So, if they want us—if we want to stay focused on it, then we will stay focused on it until we choose to grow up. Like, basically, we're here to grow up. So, the only thing that is the any problem is the part of us that's not grown up yet, and that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. There's no—it's not judgment. It's not, you know, what I mean? It's not better or worse. People, it's just—it be like if you know if you compare a grapevine and an oak tree, which one's better? They're not. Oak tree is tall and strong, and grapevine produces grapes. That's how we are. But a grapevine might not be able to withstand the wind in the same way.<br>So, we might come to a life that's tough to and I'm like, "Oh, I can't manage this wind." Well, it's okay right now. You know, your state is more like a grapevine. That's okay. See, it's not about better or worse. It's just we explore the weaker aspects of self. Weaker meaning unevolved. That's all it means. Like, it's really important we recognize that because the fear itself doesn't actually have the power. It feels like it does when we're terrified. It feels like it has all sorts of power. Like, I'm not making light of that at all. Oh my gosh, no. Terror like, oh, but I'm just pointing out that that whole thing, we are deeper than all of that. Consciousness is always deeper. It's always at the root. It's nothing is taking place outside of it, and it's made of bliss and love and joy.<br>Susan, I'll throw a concept out to you. Most of our talk has been about it's a kind of a self-focus. What did I come here to learn? Okay, but earlier Christian made a comment that I fully agree with that sometimes we come here—there are other aspects of why we come, and that's to help others. Let me—can I interrupt real quick? I just want—I'm sorry, interrupt just want to say one important concept. The other is yourself because we are all one thing, but we're here to help one another. It's a collective. So, the point I was going to make to Susan was I'm not saying this is your purpose in life. I'm saying if you create anger in others, it's possible that that was part of who you agreed to come in and be. You could be helping others learn how to deal with anger. That's possible. You're the instrument for creating that anger so other people can grow and evolve. I'm not saying that's what the answer is. I'm just trying to say that the complexity of the options out there—we—I mean, that's part of the veil. I think we're not allowed to know with specificity why things are the way they are because that would compromise the quality of what we learned.<br><br><br>Bill, Mesty, welcome. You have just joined the room, and you got a little question already. Go ahead.<br>Okay, Bill, you there? You may be trying to figure out how to activate his microphone. No problem, but that's one. While waiting for Bill to get active, I want to thank everybody for participating. I mean, it's easy for me to generate questions, but I'm really happy that others that now even at the late hour are getting engaged and showing their thinking and absorbing everything that Christian said today. I'm just happy to have this share the space and have the space. It's real. <br>Like, I think that people—not to put us in a category, okay, but like people like us that mean meaning people who are like aware and searching have some level of awareness tend to feel isolated or alone or overstimulated by the raucous world we live in, but that sensitivity and that love that we have can be a strength too, and we can feel that when we get together as a group and share. There's a resonance that takes place, and that is a beautiful thing. So, I just want to encourage everybody here to feel empowered. It doesn't matter like what age you are or what state your body is in or any of that stuff. Just you know, if we can focus on this together, there is a resonance that takes place in consciousness, and that actually helps the whole world.<br>Bill, have you been able to figure out how to articulate your question? If not, L had one, and we come back to Bill. I'll go ahead and lower Bill's hand for now, and Bill just raise it if you'd like to.<br>Sir, okay, somebody else. Yeah, L.<br>Yeah, I was just having a thought that the lady who was talking earlier—it just came to me that sometimes if you have light and people aren't in the light yet, they're going towards it, there's nothing like you said, there's nothing wrong with them. They just haven't reached that yet. They will perceive it as fear from you if you have a light that's brighter than theirs. So, it's not always that you're projecting something that's not good, and like you said, in the end, we are all one, and we all have the same capabilities. <br>And what I'm feeling here lately is that we're getting really close to the end where everybody—everything like they used to say in the 60s and 70s, "Everything is everything," and all one, and veil is about ready to come down. And I remember in the Bible, it says, "Suddenly, things would happen." So, they may—they may not, but we all know that we're bigger than what we think we are here because this is—it started out as third dimension, hopefully we're in the fourth by now or fifth, and we're going to go higher than that. But when we get to that higher, we'll be what we intended to be when we first started here, which is of one mind. <br>And the way I look at it sometimes is that God is the ocean, and we're just drops of water, and everybody's the same. We have the same qualities and everything, but we're here to help each other. And like Jim was saying before too, I had the thought that maybe she was here or some of us are here to help somebody else. It's not even about us. And I think about little babies who come here, and they're not even here for two or three days. They turn around and go back home. It's not—they signed up for—you know, they could handle it, but they couldn't. So, and that's just the thought.<br>Yeah, thank you.<br>All right, Bill, want to unmute? Looks like you're muted.<br>Bill, if you prefer, you could just type your question in the chat.<br>While we're waiting for Bill, just a brief comment to the last comment. So, yeah, sometimes the light, as you put it, can stimulate someone else who has fear because like one of ego's main activities is to like secure the self through beliefs, and if you say something that challenges beliefs, nothing will trigger fear faster. So, it very much is quite literally a challenge to fear. <br>So, you know, of course, we should try to be judicious about—we don't want to tip over someone's apple cart if we're not ready, but like I have a friend of mine, a non-duality teacher in the UK, who the way he puts it is, "We don't want to pour ice water over somebody if it's not going to be helpful for them." Yeah, so, Bill, it's just up. I'm—what I'm saying is sometimes it's just you being in the space. You don't have to say anything, do anything because energy is there.<br>Yep. Yeah, no, there is also so there's that's a different aspect of it because there's a vibrational—most people are not consciously aware of it. I am energetically sensitive, so I do feel it. There is a difference in vibration with each person and each person's intention, state of being, you name it, and there are vibrations that locally are not resonant. Let's just put it that way.<br>Yeah, thank you.<br>You so Bill typed in chat. He said, "You mentioned that life is like watching a movie. The danger in us thinking this is that we could become too detached from experiences we're having. So, would it not be better to say that if we're watching a movie, it's a very interactive one?"<br>Oh, yes, the movie is a metaphor. It's just a symbol. This is an interactive movie, and the very nature of this movie is that we have to live with the choices that everybody else has made, including ourselves. So, like last—like when I got in that car five weeks ago, the gentleman behind me was probably just looking out his window. He made a choice to get distracted or something. I don't know, and he hit me and destroyed my car and sent me to the ER. Like, I have to now—I just that's okay. <br>That's my circumstance set now. Very much an interactive movie. The interactiveness makes it high stakes, and the high stakes is what gives it such ump—you know, so much experiential learning value. Even so, we can simultaneously be in the world but not of it. That's not a detachment in the dismissal sense. Fear and ego dismiss. Awakened detachment is not dismissal. It is actually full engagement, full awareness, full clarity, full presence, full commitment, full interaction, and yet in that state of full awareness, we just know—feel deeply—we know it like it's not like an idea. It's actually felt in consciousness that we transcend the world and that we're in it but we're not of it.<br>So, hopefully, that speaks to your question. And I have about four minutes, and then I'm going to have to go. Jim, sorry.<br>Yeah, well, it's about time to bring this to a close, I think. Christian, I very much appreciate your willingness, and we missed the first opportunity. I'm happy that we got able to get this together tonight. I think you can tell from the reactions of people that what you had to say touched a lot of folks, prompted some thinking, elevated our vibration. So, I appreciate your participation. <br>That everybody here, it's a collective effort. So, this will get recorded and posted probably within a day on our YouTube channel. Oh, great. Bill, particularly you missed the of this, you'll be able to watch this probably tomorrow or the next day. I'd like to point out that if you're in Greensboro, we have an in-person gathering at the Benjamin Parkway library this Saturday at 10:00 a.m. We're going to do a little meditation, but then we're going to focus on remote viewing and talk about techniques that we can use to bring perceptions to our conscious mind, and we'll get a chance to try a couple remote views. So, bring a pencil and paper and prepare to be surprised at what you are capable of.<br>Proceeding next Tuesday, we have another presentation. My friend Ana is going to be talking about her work with graphology. You probably have received a promotion about this, so I would encourage you to consider attending this.<br>It's amazing all the different ways we have of ascertaining underlying aspects of ourselves. So, again, Christian, I look forward to seeing you on Labor Day weekend out in Phoenix. Excellent. Anybody else wants to experience another level of love in a group setting, you ought to consider coming out to that conference. All right, thank you for being here this evening. We'll bring this—thank you, everybody. Have a wonderful evening experiencing being human. Thank you. It's wonderful. Wonderful. Thank you. Take care. Thank you. Now, must stay awesome. I must stay brother. Good night, all.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2024/a-walk-in-the-physical-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2024/A Walk in the Physical with Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:05:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alchemizing Fear and the Significance of Coming to Earth with Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>8 JUL 2024<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BUy9v0rafs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BUy9v0rafs</a>  <br><br><br>Host: Christian, it’s such an honor to connect with you. Thank you so much for being here.  <br>Christian: Thank you. It’s an honor.  <br>Host: You know, you and I were chatting a little bit before we started recording, and you mentioned the pretenses of being here, being on this Earth plane. I’d love to start our conversation about what we might be forgetting about this human experience. What are we forgetting about it?  <br>Christian: It’s often more what we’ve forgotten. We’ve created so much form, so much belief, so much convention, so much expectation, so much definition that we’ve applied, and then we normalize it. It’s like, “This is the way we do things.” But consciousness itself, spirit itself, transcends all form. We give rise to it. We apply the meaning. So, our true nature is so expansive and so full of love, joy, peace, and freedom. And we often lose sight of that in the convention.  <br>Host: Do you feel we have to lower our vibration to even come into this reality?  <br>Christian: Very much so, yes. In my pre-birth experience, I can’t describe with enough strong language the depth of the vibrational drop that we agree to undertake through veiling to be incarnate, to be physical. It’s very real, very jarring, very visceral. There’s a huge vibrational distance. I don’t want to make it sound like duality, but in simple terms, vibrationally, if our true nature is total connectedness, peace, freedom, joy, knowing, and power, then as we agree to take on the limitations of biology and the physical experience overall, there’s a huge vibrational step down into that experience. It’s like a Grand Canyon-sized vibrational step.  <br>Host: You mentioned all the rules or beliefs that we take on or adapt to being here, and our true nature being so incredibly expansive. What would it be like if we had more of a felt sense of that on a day-to-day basis?  <br><br><br>Christian: It would be love, freedom, and peace. One way we can think about this is that the thing that’s extreme about Earth is the limitation level. It’s not inherently negative; it’s just very limiting—linear time, discrete location, all the limitations of biology, all the physics. It’s a very limiting, well-defined, dense experience. But because it’s so limiting, it has the opportunity to provoke fear or rejection of it. In our fear, ego has arisen, and we’ve created all sorts of layers of convention, us-versus-them thinking, and beliefs that are not in alignment with love.  <br>So, what would it be like if we were more our true selves? We would be letting go of the false, unreal associations and moving closer to our true nature, the nature of consciousness itself, which is total love and freedom. We can actually actualize that here on Earth. If we choose love, freedom, joy, and authenticity more and more, that will become more and more actualized in ways here on Earth because the thing that’s real is consciousness, not even the physical. As consciousness changes, as it chooses love and integrates and processes fear out, as we grow past it and heal past it, the thing that’s real is consciousness. So, its vibration increases. That just means we’ve integrated the low and are moving back towards what we really are.  <br>Host: That’s so beautifully expressed. I want to get into your birth remembrance in a minute, but from your vantage point, do you feel like we’re moving towards an expanded sense of consciousness as a collective?  <br><br><br>Christian: Yes, we definitely are. There are different terms for it, but the “awakening” is an okay term. It just means the human race, as a collective, is going through a great shift right now. We are in the process of working through and integrating a lot of that old garbage, the old fear-based stuff that’s been so deeply rooted. That processing of fear is a growth towards joy, freedom, and an actualization of it.  <br>In my pre-birth experience, I remember knowing—I was born in 1980—and I remember knowing very matter-of-factly that the human race and Earth as a whole were entering what we now call the awakening. It was just seen and known: “Oh, this is the awakening.” We’re really trying to process a lot in one or two or three or five generations. It’s a lot.  <br>Now, the vibration compared to even 10 or 20 years ago, which is a very short amount of time, is significantly different.  <br>Host: Do you feel like that catalyzes greater fear coming to the surface to be looked at, healed, and released?  <br><br><br>Christian: I wouldn’t say greater fear, but yes, it’s true that the higher vibration we go, the more the lower vibrational stuff that’s still in the basement has to be pulled up because it’s dissonant. It doesn’t resonate, so it’s prompted to the surface. That’s one of the reasons we see so much friction on the surface right now. We’re actually in a much more evolved place than we were as a species even 50 or 100 years ago, or even 10 or 20 years ago. But we have so much fear history, so much crap in the basement, that as we raise in vibration, it’s called up to be processed. That means it has to be seen, felt, and faced. This is real experience integration we’re doing here, not just play on the side.<br>
Host: That makes sense. To your point, those memories are so deeply ingrained. The experience of being pregnant right now brings up the idea of how much is imprinted in the womb experience that we’re not fully aware of—emotions, trauma, joy, whatever the case may be. There’s so much picked up in those formative months prior to incarnating. Would you say, from your experience, that has been the case?  <br>Christian: I would differentiate incarnation versus birth. In my case, I incarnated quite a time before birth—a long time before I was born. At least, that’s how it felt. I don’t know how old my body was—maybe 10 or 12 weeks, maybe 14 weeks. I don’t know exactly, but I know I incarnated while the body was still very early in its stages. I felt like I was in the womb for a long time, so I was having conscious experience in the womb before I was born.  <br>Host: Wow. Do you feel like many, if not all, babies incarnate with a remembrance of realities other than the Earth plane and then forget over time?  <br><br><br>Christian: Yes. First of all, we are all on the other side already. At the deepest levels, we already know all of what we are. But practically speaking, the incarnation process itself is a commitment into the limitation set and into the veil. What makes the veil so effective is that we become focused and associated into the forms of life. Young children and babies are not yet deeply associated into form. They’re just getting sensory experience and starting to learn, so they’re much more free to come and go. By the time we’re five or so, we’re focused on the thinking, the story, the bodily experience, and that focus has cemented the experience of being veiled.  <br>Host: I love how you describe that. From that perspective, could we, at any time, widen our awareness, our sense of consciousness, and tap into multiple realities?  <br>Christian: Yes. The metaphor I like to use is that we’re always in the movie theater watching the movie. You might get really lost in the movie, staring at the screen really hard. The screen here—the images on the screen—are all of our thoughts, all the sense data, all the story of who we are. That’s what we get lost in. But if we take time in meditation to return our focus back to what we really are, let go of the thinking, and return to alertness, we may naturally, without even trying, have portions of our larger self rise up because they were always there. It’s more like we put down what we’re not rather than going and getting something new.  <br>Host: It was through a meditative experience that triggered your remembrance of your pre-birth experience and planning, correct?  <br><br><br>Christian: Yes. I had pre-birth memory up until the age of about five or six, and then it left me completely. I had no memory of that for most of my early adult life. I’m 44 now, but when I was 30, I took up a long-term meditation practice. I meditated for maybe 40 or 60 minutes a day every day for years. After a few months, I had my first non-physical experience, and it was super eye-opening. I wasn’t expecting anything, but it was really shocking.  <br>Host: What inspired you to begin your meditation practice at the age of 30?  <br>Christian: I’ve always been a spiritual seeker, but in my early adult life, it took the form of Lutheran Christianity. At the time, I was beginning to watch videos from the consciousness explorer Tom Campbell, a physicist who is also an out-of-body traveler. At first, I was like, “Wow, this is really out there,” but I felt this nudge to keep with it. One of the most important things he said was, “Go investigate your consciousness beneath thought. Be a scientist. Go see.”  <br>The first time I meditated, I remember it was about 10 minutes. I was out on the hammock in my backyard. At first, after 10 minutes of meditating, I felt relief because I didn’t even know how painful and anxiety-provoking being lost in thought all the time could be. I felt a little bit of peace, and that’s how I got started.  <br>Host: Did you discover that was connected to a part of your purpose and intention incarnating here?  <br><br><br>Christian: I feel that I’m not really supposed to talk too much about any connection I might know to what I’m doing here. I just know that I’m excited to be a part of the awakening process in whatever small way. My pre-birth planning was primarily around a personal soul-level interest to process and integrate a certain fear that in the past has been very difficult for me. That’s the primary intention for this life—to experience this one specific fear and really get into it, process it, and heal it.  <br>Host: How much do you feel like themes carry over from lifetime to lifetime?  <br>Christian: They very much can carry over. It depends on the individual and what we’re working through. The simplest way to put it is that you are you. If you go have one experience over here or another experience over there, you’re still you. Of course, you take with you what you are.  <br>Host: Your book is called A Walk in the Physical. Can you share more about it and how people can go deeper with your work?  <br>Christian: Yes, the book is available to be read online for free at the third link down on the book page of my website, awalkinthephysical.com. It’s not primarily about my experience; it’s about trying to help us feel and remember who we really are through an intellectual context. It’s about pointing us back towards what we really are.  <br>Host: Thank you so much, Christian, for sharing your wisdom and transparency. It’s been an incredible conversation.  ]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2024/alchemizing-fear-and-the-significance-of-coming-to-earth-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2024/Alchemizing Fear and the Significance of Coming to Earth with Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:06:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Beyond Conscious A Conversation with Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP2wpla59fo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP2wpla59fo</a><br>14 APR 2024<br><br><br>Well, we'll just dive right in and go for the next hour and see where Spirit leads us. So, welcome to the Beyond Conscious Becoming Multi-Dimensional Podcast—all things multi-dimensional. I think really what we're going to be tapped to visit and share about, for the benefit of anyone who listens now and probably well into the future, because I could feel it before we got on today, is this incredible walk we do here—alchemizing all of the density, all of the lower emotional states back into love. I mean, I love talking about multi-dimensionality, and we can talk about that and inner tech transfer and all that good stuff, and we definitely will. But yeah, my own team is confirming that what people really need help with is this density stuff, right? So, let me go ahead and introduce you to everyone.<br>This is Christian Sundberg, and he has put together this beautiful meditation, reflections, and rememberings—a walk in the physical, understanding the human experience within the larger spiritual context. You existed before your human experience, and you will exist after. Drawing from his unique pre-birth memories, Christian Sundberg provides an encouraging framework for understanding the nature of the human experience within the larger spiritual context. "A Walk in the Physical" is a nonlinear reality model that boils down the very vast into succinct, accessible language. More than a set of ideas, though, it is a tool meant to point you towards the portion of yourself that already exists right now beyond Earth. At the heart of the book is the theme of love, and it describes why authentic love, even in small matters, is so deeply important to our human journey.<br>Thank you so much for putting this out in the world. I use it pretty much daily. I get told to go to a certain page number, and it's always exactly what I need—a little reminder. So, I'm sure we'll be Spirit-led, and they'll tell me what pages to go to today. But I first just want to give you the floor, welcome you, thank you for being here, and let you go ahead and share your story because it is so incredibly powerful. Then we'll have some fun.<br><br><br>Sure. Thank you so much for having me on. When I sensed into the energy of what you're offering, it's so amazing, and I'm just like, "Oh my gosh, how can I even match it and serve it?" I'm honored. So, if there's any way you want to guide me, please let me know. You bet. Yeah, we're both very much in service here today. I can feel it. Yes, it's a great honor to be in service on Earth.<br>So, I'll share my story in brief, with a disclaimer that language cannot possibly speak to it at all. You know, language is words, form, symbols, and that form is specific to our local world and its assumptions, whereas our true nature transcends those assumptions. So, I'll share, but as soon as we open our mouths, we're just butchering it. You know what I mean? There's just no way to really articulate it. So, I just have to say that up front because it's very difficult to speak to, and I know some of this sounds pretty out there. You know, I'm a working professional. I'm a very down-to-earth, rational type of person, so I understand how some of these concepts sound. And I didn't share it for the first eight years after this understanding and awareness came back to me because it's just the kind of thing you don't talk about in the mainstream.<br><br><br>Okay, so I remember long ago, before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical. I guess I should set the stage even a bit more before I go into the detail. So, up until about the age of five or six, I had some pre-birth awareness. As a small child, I remember choosing to come to Earth, and I knew that this was just an experience we're all having together, and it was a neat experience. But nobody else talked about it, so I thought, "Okay, I'll die," you know? And then that memory left me completely by the age of five or six, which is pretty normal here, and I had no recollection of it at all until the age of 30. My body is 44 right now. So, at 30, I took up a long-term meditation practice, and I began to have out-of-body experiences. They were extremely eye-opening and personally paradigm-shifting. I also began to have this pre-birth memory return. So, that's what I'm sharing, as you requested that I share my story.<br>So, I remember coming across a being who had been physical long before I had ever even been physically incarnated. In those reality systems, you can feel and know tangibly the nature of other beings because we're all telepathically connected. We're like one with each other, and you can feel that. You're still individuated, but you can feel that others are connected to you—they're a part of you in a way. <br>So, I could feel from him this incredible power, love, joy, freedom, and just this depth—this quality of essence is the only way I can describe it. It was like, "Oh my gosh, do you feel as much joy and freedom and power as I feel that you feel?" And he said, "Yes." And he shared with me many things, but chief among them was that he had lived a physical lifetime—well, many lifetimes—but one in particular, he had this physical experience where he had suffered a long-term health condition, some kind of pain that lingered with him for a long time. The way that he chose to meet that and process it allowed this refinement of his being. I don't know how to describe it—like he refined through the experience, and it was absolutely amazing and breathtaking. And I was like, "I want to do that. I want to do that." I was so inspired and fired up.<br>And he communicated something to the effect of, "And this is not negative, it's just like, 'Yeah, that's what they all say. You don't know how hard it can be. You're just ignorant to it.'" Nothing negative, it's just you don't know what you're asking, kind of thing. And I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do this." And he said, "Well, go talk to your guides." So, I lived many times since then, and I don't remember, of course, the majority of that, but I remember finding this being again later and showing him I was on the path, and he was encouraging.<br>Okay, so then the majority of this pre-birth experience is of a time somewhat immediately preceding this lifetime, where I had taken a long break in between lifetimes. And I remember this guide coming to me over and over again, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" Not like pestering, but just kind of reminding me of my own intention. You know, and finally being like, "Okay, I'm ready to go back." <br>And then reviewing with this guide what I can only describe as like my state—who I am, who I had been, what I had been and known, and like what I had integrated. You could say maybe like reviewing virtues or something, even. I don't like to put it so dry like that, but it was like I could just review, "Okay, these are all the types of experiences I really understood and qualities that I really knew I had or something." You know, "had" is a bad word—it's not like you have a quality. It was like I had integrated all these experiences to a certain quality of being. But there was this one area that was blatantly obvious—like that was a thing I needed to work on. And I don't like the words "work on" either because that makes it sound like a task or something, but it wasn't hard to identify. It was almost like a big joke. It was like, "Well, that's pretty easy to see what that is."<br>And it was what I can only describe as a really low vibration fear—a fear that had bested me in a previous experience. In a previous physical experience, because of the fear, I had turned into an egoic monster. You know, because ego arises from fear. And so, in that monster, I mean, in that experience, I had become a monster. I became very damaging to other people because this fear was so intense. And so, I was like, "Wow, okay, I was really excited to get in there and really remeet this and integrate it because I could see and feel that if I could do that, it would enable a profound expansion of being, not only for myself but for the whole. It would be like an incredible service for all that is."<br>But I could see even from that point of view, like, "Oh my gosh, this is so low vibration." And so, I asked my guide, "Has any other being ever integrated something this low in this specific way?" And he said, "Yes, and you have all of time available to you to do so. There's no hurry." Like, "Yes." And I just knew, like, if it could be done, then I would do it. Like, if it was at all possible, then I would do it. So, they brought me a lifetime that was a really good match for the intention of meeting and integrating that fear. And it wasn't this lifetime—it was an immediately preceding physical life.<br>I remember reviewing that life in great detail and accepting that life, and then accepting the veil. Okay, so the veil is just a word. It's what I remember most about this, and it's on my mind every day. It's like if you imagine the body of your awareness being connected to all things and being completely full of love and power and totally connected and having access to all knowledge and feeling and knowing everything—everything is within you, a very high vibration state. <br>And then plummeting down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower into an extremely low, dense, cold—just a metaphor—state of being. And it was like having all of my knowing erased and all of my connectedness disappear and being shoved inside of a tiny tunic, you know, is what it felt like—being incarnated into a body. And then, but also feeling very empty, like the vacuum of space or something, like just absent of stuff. It just felt so cold and empty, but yet dense.<br>So, I was in the womb in that life, but I was only there a short time. And I'm like, "I am not doing this. There is no way. I am not going to tolerate this for a lifetime. No, no, no." So, because I was afraid immediately, I summoned my might, my strength, and I fought my way out, back past the veil. I knew I could do that, and I succeeded in doing that. But I immediately had a life review because I had become aware that I had killed the body—I had killed the fetus that was to be mine. <br>And I saw how my fear affected the mother, and not only the mother but hundreds of others that the mother would interact with because I had heaped grief upon her because of my fear and because I had caused a miscarriage. And so, I was like, "I mean, the best word in English is 'responsible' for that." You know, that's the best way I can put it. And you know, from that point of view, it's okay. You know, it's okay. Everything is like this is just a big play. It's okay. There's nothing truly wrong. But I could see very objectively, like, "Oh man, I got a lot of fear. I gotta do something about this. This is a lot of fear."<br>So, and then I spent some time—and I know this sounds really out there too—but in a place that was all I can describe as like a veil acceptance simulator. It was like a room where you practiced surrendering your power, your control, over to a mock veil because I had rejected it the first time. So, now I wanted to be like, "Okay, I'd like to practice so I don't do that again." And then, eventually, sometime later, they brought me this life. And I reviewed this life in incredible detail. <br>I reviewed millions and millions of possibilities of what might unfold in this life. It was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side and started at the roots—you know, the thick part of the trunk—and worked your way out to the branches, it was like reviewing that for millions and millions of potential paths, outcomes, experience paths. And there were events in it, but it wasn't primarily about events or things. It was more about, "What would it be like to be me, you know, to be Christian, the human, at this point or at this moment?" You know, like, "What would the experience feel like?" Basically, in great depth.<br>And I remember asking questions about the life and making certain requests about certain traits. Like, for instance, I asked to be intelligent again because I had known that I had been intelligent the last few lives, and I preferred to do that again. I didn't want to have a non-intelligent life experience. And they said, "Yes, you can do that." And I asked, and I knew that it would be beneficial if I were to be male in this life because it would help in a certain way for me to face this fear. <br>Not that there's, you know, not that either sex is better or worse at facing fear, it's just different qualities of energy. And there's like, you know, being male almost as like a certain obtuse edge or something. So, I knew that was meaningful. And I knew that my father would instill confidence in me when he raised me, and that that confidence would be really important so that I had a rock to stand on when this fear hit me in my early 20s. It was likely to arrive in the form of a biological trauma, a health condition that did happen.<br>So, I reviewed all this, and I remember there having to be a moment to say, "Yes." And I don't remember that moment, but I remember being in this waiting area, and then my guide coming to me like, "Go now. Like, now's the time. You got to go now. Like, Earth time, buddy," kind of thing. You know, like, "Don't wait." I'm like, "Okay, now." And then being in this area that I can only describe like a technician's chamber or like a mechanic's shop—hard to describe. It was like above the Earth, and I could see the Earth below in this—there's like a shaft below me. And there are these beings in this shop—I don't know how to describe—like a space station or something almost—that are very technical in nature. They're like technicians—veil application technicians. Their quality of being is such that they are extremely capable at figuring out organic veil application.<br>So, I remember them asking me one last time, "Are you sure? Like, are you sure? Are you ready to go?" And I'm like, "Yeah," because I knew once I said yes here, I was in for the ride. Like, there's no going back. You know, it's like getting on a roller coaster. You know, like, once the roller coaster starts, you can't get off until the roller coaster comes to a complete stop. That felt like that. And saying yes, and then once again feeling the veil come over me and plummeting down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower in vibration all the way down to being bodily. And this time, just trying not to fight it because I knew that I had rejected it before. <br>And I was just, "Okay, just surrender." Like, basically just surrendering my control to whatever it would do to me. That was my intention—like, let the veil grab and take hold and sink in. And I did that for a while, and eventually, I sent one message back to the technicians, "Did it take? Like, did I make it to the physical?" And they sent one message back, "Yes." And actually, I remember feeling accomplished because even making it to the physical is one heck of an accomplishment vibrationally because it's such a low vibration point of being. To even be physical is like, "Whoa, this is pretty awesome."<br>So, I was there for a while, and then after a while, I'm like, "I'm not doing this. There's just no way." Like, once again, I began to have fear. I'm like, "I've lost everything that I am. I've forgotten everything that I am. I'm not doing this." So, once again, I began to summon my might to fight my way out. And when I did that, I had the most holy experience of this physical life. It's so personal, but I felt the Great I Am presence of Source—God, what we call God—come to me and expand me back out. <br><br><br>And I felt all the universe within me, and I felt all the stars. I felt our sun. I felt its life. It was alive. Like, our sun is conscious. You know, it sounds wild, but I experienced it. I experienced that the consciousness of our sun was in me, and it was churning with bliss. And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And so, I was like, "Oh, okay. Then I don't need to fight." You know, really, because that was what it was about. I was fighting because I had lost what I was. And so, then I relaxed and let go back into the simple existence of being in the womb.<br>And I was there for a while, and then it seemed like a long time later, I remember being born. I remember the shock, the sight, the sound. I remember looking up at the nurses and not having any idea what was going on, just seeing these beings and being like, "What is happening? Like, who are these beings?" And feeling love for them, actually, and being super curious. And it's funny because I shared this with my father years later, and he said, "Oh, you had the most curious look I've ever seen on a baby's face." He said, "You were just had such an intense curiosity." <br>I remember looking up at everything and being like, "What is happening? Where am I? What is this place?" You know, so, and then a couple of weeks later, when I was two weeks old, my body almost died because I got sick. And my parents had to have me baptized in the hospital. And so, I don't know if somehow that has something to do with what I've shared, but anyway, so that's like a short summary. There's a lot connected to it.<br>I used to think back on the flowchart when I was getting older, like when I was three and four, maybe five, I used to like cheat, like just be like, "Okay, what's going to happen tomorrow?" Like, just for simple stuff, like nothing earth-shattering to the human, but as a kid, I'm like, "Are we going to go to the store tomorrow? Are we going to go to the zoo? Is my neighbor going to come over?" And just like checking the database. And eventually, as I got older, that ability diminished significantly until I couldn't cue the database anymore. <br><br><br>But I assumed certain things that were true in our higher systems would still be true here, and they weren't. And so, that was very surprising to me, like when I realized that we can't feel each other's emotions here. And when I realized, as I got older, that people in positions of authority and leadership were not necessarily loving and wise. You know, on Earth, that's pretty common, actually. The higher you go, the people in positions of authority often have to fight hard to get there. You know, dog-eat-dog world kind of thing. That's not the way of the higher realms where love and wisdom is the power. You know, so anyway, I feel like my whole life I've kind of been trying to come to terms with the alienness of the human experience.<br>And I'm a fully participative, functional adult. I'm a project manager for an insurance company now, and I've worked hard. I have two kids. I raise a family, and I've been very productive in all that, but I have never felt fully fooled, you know, by what's going on here. And yeah, so that's just a quick summary.<br>That's beautiful and opens up so many different conversation points. First of all, I just want to give you the disclaimer: you can't say anything too weird on this channel. Okay? Fact: probably the weirder, the better for this audience. They're pretty primed. I'll just say, I started this channel in 2017 after vowing I would never, ever, ever do a YouTube video. I get on, and what do I do? I start talking about aliens. So, there you go. So, I had an adult-onset awakening in my early 30s with a shared NDE with my father. They gave me information that he would be leaving. Everybody thought he was going to be the cancer. He had an underlying condition nobody knew about. <br>The day he left, his childhood friend, who had passed six months before him, was behind him in the hospital. I could see him, right? And I knew he was there for my dad, helped my dad leave. And then my father just kept showing up. I should say, I had an entire movie reel of shared lifetime experiences with my father as he left. Wow, beautiful parting gift. And then he just kept showing up, and I thought, "Oh, I must miss him, so I'm making this up." <br>But then other spirits started to show up, and then it kind of was a fast-moving train. Pandora's box got opened. Yeah, it was like spirit medium to then channeling spirit guides and then ET contact and then beyond form and then really getting to this place where many of us are converging, which is remembering that everything—the foundation of reality—is love. And this is a grand experiment to see what we can alchemize back into.<br><br><br>And I'm really curious about your take. It does appear that we are in some fairly special times in this kind of physical, planetary, bipedal experience that is unlike potentially other experiences, right? I've heard you in other interviews talk about wanting to pass out flyers: "You are a multi-dimensional being." I did. I wanted to do that. Yeah, we can do the inner tech transfer, and that's kind of where I started. Like, well, we have an oversoul, and we have these higher structures, and then we can do inner tech transfer. And so, I've brought in some amazing healing abilities from other aspects and other star systems this way, and it's really exciting. You know, human evolution has been my jam since I was 15. But as my awakening continued—I don't know that it ever stops, right?—I just kind of realized where we're at now is the beginning of this amazing healing renaissance and taking all this density and alchemizing it, finding wound motivation.<br>I feel like many of us are first-generation healers, like we're taking thousands of years of ancestral trauma, and it feels like we're the ones getting off the bullet train and being like, "Stop. Exactly. Slow this thing down." But yeah, your take—the first question that came to mind as you were talking was seeing a being like that—feeling more than seeing, understanding, right? Yeah, language kind of falls short. And then recognizing that some part of you is meant for that, or is the term that's coming—that's somehow part of what your soul wants to contribute. <br>So, I talk a lot about templates, like we're taking the templates here that may have errors, omissions, distortions, and we're kind of getting things a little bit like the C-shifting it. So, when you think about when you understood that you would be integrating this fear, this particular nuanced situation for the all—yes, that's that. I mean, I could talk at length and go really deep. I'm really curious about your understanding of what does that mean, especially for you once you've wrapped this one and you've done what you set out to do. What does that—I'm trying not to put qualifiers on it—what does that mean?<br><br><br>Yeah, so first, I really like the word "alchemy" in this context because you really could say that the human experience is a process of alchemy. And what are we alchemizing? Contrast. Okay, so the physical experience is actually not negative innately. I mean, we make it—we apply a lot of negative meaning. It's actually there's only one thing that is very extreme about the physical experience, and that is its limitation. Like, it's like wearing being physical is like wearing a very extreme set of limitations. <br>Okay, so then once we're engaging this extremely challenging set of limitations potentially, then that has the opportunity to provoke our unevolved—so what I mean is like our fear, the ways that we haven't come to terms with it yet. So, how do we react when we feel separate or when we feel powerless or when we feel we don't have freedom or when we feel we're not worthy? You know, there's some of the really big ones on Earth that have thousands of variations. How do we respond when those are the perceptions that get prompted because those aren't in alignment with the truth?<br>See, the truth is that we are loved, we are free, we are powerful, but here in this great set of limitations, we can actually experience—I mean, go as far as we can push the envelope—experience separation. Separation is like the big unique limitation to this universe. Like, if we say what makes our universe so unique, separation—that is the unique extreme, unusual, off-the-charts limitation that is unique to the universe. Like, we're taking it—what if we feel completely separate from each other as much as we can? Now, we can't actually be separate, so we're only like pushing the envelope 99% or something towards separation. But now that we've done that, what do we do with it? Okay, so alchemy—alchemizing—it's just a word for how do we process the experience? How do we integrate all of the experiences we have in the human condition—all of the challenges, all the pains, all the limitations, all the contexts, all the roles, all the history?<br><br><br>So, we come into a lifetime, and we might receive—I love how you mentioned that we pass down in a chain through the generations this pain, this trauma. We've traumatized the crap out of each other, and then we pass it down generation to generation. Just slowing or stopping that is such a huge service. And like you said, then we are the ones who, on behalf of not just our family and not just ourselves but the whole, take on the role of actually facing this crap and actually processing it. I mean, it's very hard to describe that word "process," but it has to do with a quality of intention that we bring into it. So, can we meet it with love and acceptance and vulnerability and humility? <br>Can we feel it instead of reject it? That quality of intention that we bring into that is what alchemizes it because what is the thing that ultimately is actually changing? You could say "changing" is not a good word, but alchemizing, altering, evolving consciousness itself. The spirit itself is learning, growing through how it integrates these experiences and grows back towards love because love is its true nature. So, how does it, even in the limitations, wield love? That's the simplest way to put it. How does it? So, can we choose to wield love and freedom and joy and peace even with a thousand pounds on our back? That is alchemy.<br>Now, that can mean a million things practically speaking. It can mean so many different things to so many different people, and each of our intuition will guide us. It might mean willingness to feel, willingness to serve, willingness to actually do something, take some action, stop some action, take ownership in some way that hasn't been done before, have compassion for ourselves whereas nobody else taught us to. What it can mean so many different things. And as we do that, we are integrating. We're coming to terms with these experiences for ourselves and for the whole. And that is such a valuable process. And the human race, like you said, is at an interesting point in history. I don't mean to go too far forward in this because, like you said, we're going through this what we call the awakening, which is just a term, but it's basically the act of the play where the consciousness of Earth—the collective consciousness of humanity and the whole system—is starting to wake up and process all that old crap in an extremely accelerated way.<br><br><br>Now, it may look on the surface like there's all sorts of friction because guess what? We have a ton of fear in the basement. Our basement load, our garbage load, is extreme. So, when we start bringing that crap out of the basement and putting it out on the surface to be seen, it's ugly. Okay? But we are removing it from the basement and beginning to process it. And the whole human race is going through this great shift right now where we're trying to alchemize, process a huge amount of that old fear-based thinking—all sorts of us-versus-them patterns and all sorts of unworthiness and lack of freedom and lack of empowerment. Oh my gosh, like the human race for thousands of years has believed in powerlessness, but we are powerful multi-dimensional beings. Are we? So, we are rediscovering that slowly. I say "slowly" because the human personality looks slow, but from the spiritual perspective, we're doing it very quickly, right? It's so accelerated.<br>You know, I talk an awful lot about getting stuck in victim—like the victim and that kind of loop that we can get stuck in. I, at one point, should back up in just the humor. At 19, I had this moment where the veil obviously was doing its job, but I had a moment of just looking around in college and going, "I don't think I was supposed to get off here. I think I missed my stop on the intergalactic tramway. Like, what is this place, and how did I get here?" Right? There was that kind of feeling out of step. Yes, but this thing that I'm always working with people on—getting out of old loops—so when you said this experience had bested you in a prior life, I mean, this is what I think is most helpful for people of understanding how do I evolve? <br>How do I move out of this? Right? My motivation came kind of early on in my awakening where I just had some sort of remembering of, "Oh no, I'm not getting to this life review and saying, 'I biffed it.' Not doing that. I've done it too many times. I don't care what it takes. I'll talk about aliens on YouTube. I don't care. Whatever. I'll just do it." Amen. Right? But I realize it's not necessarily so straightforward for people—that getting stuck in those loops is a very real almost like hazard built into this video game, if that makes sense. So, I would just love for you to give a quick comment on that. What pops to mind?<br><br><br>The only hazard isn't actually technically built into the game. The only hazard is fear. So, that's the only thing that's the only problem. Like, I don't mean to oversimplify because it's not easy. It's incredibly not easy at times, but I'm just pointing out it's because all like believing that the video game itself—the physical reality itself—has a built-in level of it's going to screw you, that's already wrong. What I mean is, it's all it is is limiting. It all it is is well-defined. It's very consistent. <br>I don't know why this comes to mind, but like when you're a little kid and you watch a little kid, and you put like a knife in a drawer and you close the drawer, and then you open up the drawer again, and the knife is still there, and they get this look like, "Oh my gosh, they get it." They get that the reality remained consistent, and the knife is still in there, and they have this—I don't know if you've seen this, but like—I just mean our reality is very persistent and consistent to the point where even within very challenging circumstances, it will remain persistent and consistent. Someone physically dies—they don't come back physically. <br>Or if you get injured, your body will remember for the rest of your life. You know what I mean? Like, that is the great limitation of the physical. That's the offering of it is it doesn't yield to you. Like, higher realities yield to us immediately because our intention, our thought, is effective. It changes reality instantaneously. Our very focus—we can see how it affects reality systems in higher systems. But here on Earth, this is the reality world. It looks like actually it is responding to us all the time, but on the surface, it looks like, "I'm not moving." You know, this car's coming at you—get in the way, it's going to hit you. You know, right? Anyway, so I'm just putting all that in context because really, that's not the problem though. The problem is simply that when we pit ourselves against or into—not against—when we put ourselves through it's a better way to put it—that much limitation and density and consistency, we may experience very deep fear. And victimhood is one of the main very challenging cycles that is difficult to get out of.<br><br><br>I mean, I have a very close friend of mine who comes to mind with this that I've been witnessing what could be really an unfolding of personal strength and freedom, but this person happens to be going through a gender identity shift, and the victimization portion of it has been the overwhelming focus. So, I don't make light of that. I don't like when I mean—I've had so many health conditions that when you're in the middle of them, they hurt so bad, or you know, whatever, depending on what it is, it can be difficult to not associate with the victimhood mentality. <br>But if you feel like a victim, what part of you is saying no? I know this is like so big and hard potentially, where in all the trauma—yes, you have been traumatized. Yes, you've been wounded by the world or others or both or the body or something. You may have a whole lifetime of pain and trauma. That victimhood is all you've known, maybe. It's a long, deep history. Okay, okay. Where is your rejection of that? And where are you then? Where can you then choose a new thing now? Because we are applying the meaning. You can choose one step—one powerful step closer towards an interpretation and meaning of freedom, joy, willingness to feel. Know like, "Okay, I feel traumatized. I'm going to feel it now. <br>How do I—where—what—who am I really?" Like, find your authentic self. Your deepest, deepest authentic self is not a victim. Your deepest authentic self is not a victim. So, if you really can locate even a small way—I'm trying to lift up the smallness is okay. It's not about big immediate—okay, in five minutes, I got to fix all my trauma. No. How do you meet this moment authentically? How do you honor what you actually feel? How do you honor what your body feels like? How do you honor what you want to do now or what you feel called to do or what your intuition is guiding you to do? How do you love the person next to you in a genuine way—not like a conditioned way? How can you actually be there for that person? That choice is what this is all about. This is all about the quality of intention that we wield, not primarily the physical itself.<br><br><br>Yeah, that's powerful. I've used the analogy, if you're a Harry Potter fan, of Devil's Snare—the harder you resist or reject, you're aiding it. Yeah, that's right. Ironically, or I should say paradoxically, it's the surrender kind of what you described in the womb—of allowing and surrendering. Yeah, it's like rejection is like putting a dam in the river of life. And then when you do that, the water piles up behind the dam, and more and more and more pressure builds up, and guess what? It doesn't feel good. And so, often the portions of our lives where we have a consistent problem or challenge that keeps arising, yeah, usually there's a rejection somewhere down there that we think is bigger than us. That's why we've closed it off. But when you turn around and say, "You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of being afraid. I honor myself enough to go look into the scary closet and pull that dam out of the river, and it can flow again." That's it.<br>You know, I just drove back from a family gathering in Fort Worth. It's only about five hours from here, and I just knew the first hour—no radio, nothing, quiet—and I needed to be in, I guess what the ancients would have put themselves in a cave by themselves, just to be with their fear because there have been fears that have just been chronically cycling back through. And I was like, "You just have to really sit with us and bring it in close. Stop trying to get away from it." Yep. Let's go ahead and just be with it and integrate it or, as we've been talking about, alchemize it. And then it doesn't have the same hold. At least this has been my experience and refinement. Like, it'll come back around, but each time it's not quite as intense as what I've discovered. Right?<br><br><br>Yeah. One thought that comes to mind there is so sometimes this is about the quality of actual intention. So, when it comes to fear, a game we may then play after what we just said is, "Oh, maybe now, okay, I want to integrate it and alchemize it because I want to get rid of it because I hate it." Okay, but then that's not necessarily to alchemize it. Then your intention is to escape it again in a new way. That's a good nuance. Yeah, very clever. So, I'm just pointing that out because facing fear is about acceptance. What does acceptance mean? It means willingness to feel whatever you weren't willing to feel before. Okay, so now the thing is though, the ego has usually covered that up with a thousand layers of distractions and stories. You know, usually we can't even locate the root fear because it's so deep. Okay, so there's a kind of a magic door though—the current moment. <br>So, what I mean is, whatever you are experiencing right now, just fully alertly feel now what's here now. Allow it. Feel it all the way. Maybe it's a sensation in your body. Maybe you find, "I have a little negative sensation in my diaphragm." Okay, feel that. And then that might prompt a thought. It might not seem relevant. It's probably relevant. You know, if you put your intention on it, and then that might connect to something else, and 3,000 layers down, it is connected. So, I'm just saying that the deeper portion of yourself—guess what? It wants you to succeed. The whole system wants you to succeed. It's all helping you. So, when you're actually finally willing because the universe is listening to your actual intention—when you're actually willing to face your crap and take ownership for real and meet what's in this moment, things will be lifted up that you might not understand the connection, but if you just pay attention and remain alert and feel what is arisen now, what is arisen now, and then maybe the next moment will arise. It's extremely painful. Maybe a depression arises. Maybe a bipolar low arises. <br>Maybe you get sick. That's okay. That's okay. Feel that. That's the new now. That's okay. Feel that now. Don't resist that. And as we practice this non-resistance to just this now moment, the doors open all the way down eventually to the root now—the root fear. That root thing that's there to be alchemized usually feels so darn big. It feels like it will destroy us if I look at it and feel it. That's the ultimate challenge then because guess what? It's not going to destroy you. Cliff notes: it's not going to destroy you. But you have to be willing. I mean, you don't have to. You can make whatever choice you like, but if you really want to face it, it is about the willingness to even let it destroy you. It won't.<br><br><br>This is intense stuff we're talking. This is true alchemy. This is what I'm talking about. This is intense. Like, this fear that I came to process—I had post-traumatic stress for a number of years. I couldn't even remember up until the age of 22. For about six or seven years, I went through five years of EMDR therapy every week. So, I probably went through two or three hundred sessions of EMDR therapy till I found lower layer, lower layer of pain, lower layer of fear, lower layer of connected negative self-perception. All this kid picked on me in seventh grade, and that really hurt. And oh, I had this experience, and you know, on and on and on, all the way down. And I kept thinking, "I think that was the root. It was so powerful and negative. <br>Oh, I thought that was the root. No, no, no." One day, I found the root. This moment that I was in a hospital bed in Chongqing, China, and I had a full knowing of this negative self-perception of being completely powerless to escape agony. And this was the fear that I came to process. But it was so deep and dark, it felt like it would absolutely destroy me. So, it's like, in order to get rid of the tornado, you have to let the tornado pick you up and fling you around and tell you its message because all the fear is is a big—all it is is trying to deliver to you a negative self-perception that's actually not true that you're resisting. That's all. And once you actually allow it and feel it, the tornado dissipates, and all that's left is what you always were, which is love and joy, except now it's way deeper because now you allowed all the way all the way down.<br><br><br>And I'm reminded of a TikToker named Emerald Sage that my wife follows. I watched a video of hers recently, and she said something like, "Spirituality, spiritual growth is not about just focusing on these few really good vibrations and ignoring everything else." True. The true spiritual walk is an acceptance of all the vibrations, all the frequencies of life, so much so that you get more of the frequencies, including even higher dimensional experiences. <br>That sounds crazy, but out-of-body experiences just started happening for me at least when I said yes to everything here. You see, like when I stop saying no and open the doors, there are blissful realms available to us that are just thousands and thousands, millions of times more radiant and beautiful than anything we could experience on Earth. They're there. They're real right now. But by rejecting anything, we're saying no to life. My team just highlighted that that was the main message that wants to get through to humanity—what Christian just said—is the rejection of the negative self-perception that isn't true. If everybody's got their cosmic highlighter out, that's the one you want to highlight and really just take to heart for the rest of this incarnation. That's the work right there. That's it.<br>Yeah, Nirvana, I was told, is all of it because you can't be in bliss if you can't experience the contrast. So, it's being able to hold all those states but with equanimity instead of the—to your point about—yeah, let's just make it all go away and let's focus on love and light. Love and light. So, I've been joking it's important to do shadow work like three curtains back, but I feel like I want to say 3,000 curtains back now after speaking with you. It's like, right, there's just always one of my clients said it. She said, "Because I said peel the onion," she said, "Oh, you mean the whole bag of onions?" Like, it's a little bag of onions. Yeah, yeah.<br><br><br>I can feel the collective being like, "Oh my gosh, talk to him about all the timeline stuff." So, okay, when you're talking about all the different branches, you know, I don't know if that's lifting at this time because they've been having me talk about exploring other timelines that we've done and weaving them in and kind of trying to bring all those composites together in interesting ways. And you can do that within just this human experience and then, of course, across your whole suite of your known aspects. <br>But you know, I get that not remembering, losing access to those data points as you spoke to earlier, helps to create the experience of limitation that we have here. Yes, anything that you can speak to about that because I could just feel everyone wondering more about that because that is the relationship most of us have. We want psychic safety, so we want certainty. We want the known. We want to be able to put things in boxes and say, "Okay, that's what I'm going to be." And I mean, I know people aren't going to want to hear this, but I've experienced we really need to be able to embrace the opposite of the undefined, the unknown, being surrendered to, as you say, the present moment and what is arising constantly here rather than trying to grasp for certainty. But I don't know, maybe changing, you know?<br>Yeah, the ego grasps for certainty because the ego just means the part of us that's responding in fear because the ego's like, "Oh my God, I don't have any power. I can't see. I can't see. Okay, let's grab something. Please, please give me a belief. Give me an understanding. Oh, now I feel better." That's okay. That's okay. We're blind. Like, this is like playing blind. You know, okay, so then the ego is just like, "Okay, I feel powerless, so I'm going to hurt the person next to me. Now I feel better." Or, "I don't have worth. Oh, but look, now I have money in my bank account. Now I have worth." See? You know, it doesn't really work. Or, "I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't know that I'm going to survive death. Tell me about what I can grab on to with the different aspects of the self or timelines." You know, the irony of course is that the opposite is the true way. Like, what I mean is, the full acceptance of not knowing is how you discover the truth.<br>Like, I don't claim to anything, but like the book "A Walk in the Physical," it was deeply the result of me surrendering to the fact I knew nothing. I had nothing. Right? All my previous beliefs were not helpful. I knew very little. I was terrified. That's okay. You see, because once you fully allow and accept that, it's like the vine that you mentioned in Harry Potter. You let go once you stop fighting, and you let go, and you get released to the chamber below the vine in Harry Potter. Like, you just—the way I would put it is, the larger portions of yourself bubble up because now you're not putting up a boundary anymore. So, timelines—okay, so I don't know too much about the mechanics of time. I mean, the way I understand it is there's—okay, so there's a lot of different universes. So, talking about just ours, I like the way Tom Campbell, the physicist, describes timelines. He describes how there are many trillions of units of time per second, and each unit of time, the simulation is calculating all the possibilities and predicting outcomes many, many, many possible avenues. <br>And that's what I experienced pre-life. Like, the system could see there were all these potentials, but I didn't know which was going to actualize. See, there's novelty in the system. That's what makes this universe so valuable actually is the system doesn't know exactly what's going to happen. It can predict it pretty darn well because it knows us really well. It knows all the rules. Spirit knows all the rules. It knows all the virtual reality rules and knows physics and knows all the made-up physics. Okay, it made it up. It created the rules. It knows you. It knows me. So, it's pretty darn good at predicting outcomes. So, most people, when they ping into the records or check psychically, they usually get pretty good results. <br>You know, but so okay, so then but every unit of time, every one of us is making choices. That's the unknown—what intention will we actually wield? What choices will we actually make? And then that allows one actualized thread to develop through the timelines and many trillions of unactualized threads. And so, some who explore the akashic records may get a full-blown real visual, sight, sound of—the example Tom Campbell uses is, "Show me New York City 50 years after the Nazis won World War II." You know, if they won World War II, what would New York City look like? <br>The database will show you this is the most likely outcome for what would have happened if that happened. And it's all there. You can see it. You can taste it. You could touch it. But it's just a recording. It's not a novel unfolding simulation anymore, whereas the thread that we're on is novel. It's the actual—what choices were actually made. You see? And then in our post-life review, we can actually review what would have happened if I made this choice. And the system is pretty good for your benefit of showing, "This probably what would have happened." But you know, we didn't make every choice. We made the choices we made, and that thread is the life thread that we're on now for this given personality portion of the self.<br>Yeah, thank you for that. And I know my viewers will be like, "Well, you got to ask him about multi-dimensionality." In your recollection, if that's part of your pre-birth memories, do you have memories of other systems in which you just are like, "Now that one," and then how does that—you know, is it part of your composite that you're drawing from in this experience?<br><br><br>Yeah, so now I interpret that question to be less about multi-dimensionality itself and more about the other personality portions of my own soul and my connection to them. It's almost kind of like, I guess, if just like—what are some of your favorite experiences in the all that is and why? Oh, what as Christian or not as Christian? Any, I guess, all. I guess it's like a little further afield, you know? So, well, I'll just say a couple of things. So, like, first of all, I know that I've had non-human intelligent life experience. So, I've had at least one experience in what we would call an alien civilization, but that's not like a big deal to Spirit, right? It's not weird at all. Like, I know to us it's like, "Oh my gosh, aliens. Now we're being super woo-woo." Well, I mean, the universe is a super, super big place. If you just—I mean, come on, it's ridiculously large, and life is working with all of it. Okay? <br>So, there's more than just Earth going on here, but Earth is extremely unique and precious. And Earth is like—I know this is a tangent from your question, but Earth is like a bunch of sixth graders or fourth graders maybe out on a playground playing very loudly and not being super respectful to each other and kind of making a mess and trying to get to college in like one year. You know what I mean? Like, that's and that is vibrationally really obvious in the universe. Like, it's really unique. So, to get to play a human on Earth is like winning the lottery. Anyway, but specifically to your question about other experiences, so I mean, gosh, I've had experiences in this life that even just some that are brief, but I've had out-of-body experiences that are so beautiful and so blissful. <br><br><br>Like, I remember having one out-of-body experience where I was just looking at this incredible landscape, I guess, with a sky and trees and grass, and the grass was so green that it was alive. The grass was alive, and I felt like the grass was so beautiful that I could spend all day looking at the grass, and I would be overjoyed just by the grass—just one blade of grass. That is how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful high realm experiences can be. And the colors there are more rich and alive—vibrant beyond like this is like a black-and-white movie by comparison. You know? <br>And so, even just one—I just, you know, I think a one experience there, I maybe, you know, two minutes in that place in what we would perceive to be time—oh my gosh, it's heavenly. Now, the thing is, that can be very distracting. So, in my own case, because I was like, "Oh, now I want to do that all the time because that's like way better than this." So, but then my intuitive guidance is, "No, no, you need to focus. <br>This is your here to do this. So, let's use the human experience while I'm here," kind of thing. So, I try not to, you know, focus too much in that direction. Non-physical experiences may arise. Like, one time I was out of body, all of a sudden my body was sleeping, and I was in this realm of light that was so beautiful and so blissful and so high vibration, and I did this thing where like, "Oh my gosh, I'm here." And then I thought, "Oh my God, I could feel my body like way down vibrationally like this tiny, dense point of existence way down," and I was like, "Oh, this is an opportunity for me to see if I can straddle that whole vibration at once." <br>So, I tried to—this is hard to describe—I tried to like step all the way down into the body vibration and feel the whole—like, can I be so big that I can even feel that? Like, so those kinds of experiences—just a couple like super quick, simple, I guess, examples, but they're very impactful. <br><br><br>I mean, I, after I started having non-physical experiences, I came back like I said, like you said in the beginning, I just wanted to tell people. You know, I just wanted to—I said to my wife, I mean, I only considered this for like two minutes or something because I know it's ridiculous, but I was so excited. I said, "I'm going to make flyers and put them in people's mailboxes. I'm going to say, 'You're a multi-dimensional being having a human experience. You have nothing to fear.'" You know? And she's like, "Yeah, you're going to be that guy if you do that." <br>I was like, "Yeah, I that's not going to work." It's that effect. I tend to have either people are really riveted, or they're running for the door, or they're running for—I understand. You know, I'm a really down-to-earth, rational person too. Like, I have a—I mean, I seek to kind of bridge the two worlds actually because this is a real thing. Okay? This is not just woo-woo. It's real. So, it does stand up to the greatest intellectual rigor. It's just that human understanding is very limited and very form-based. Materialism is—materialism itself is wrong. Like, it's just wrong. The idea that material is the base foundation of reality—no, right? It's not. Like, it's just wrong. So, like, everything we build on top of that is wrong. Like, we have to get deeper than that, and we can. You know?<br>Yeah, I mean, that's the biggest resistance I see, and I had to go through it initially myself, was that you're asking for a complete worldview shift, and nothing disrupts psychic safety like a complete worldview shift. You got it. You got it. Well, I mean, that's my book. That is the thing about it. It's a worldview shift, but I felt guided by Spirit that like—okay, okay, so like, I'll just say at least this that like I feel like my book is like my life's work, okay, in the sense that I learned—I'm historically an intellectual, so I learned an intellectual framework, and then I had these experiences, and then I realized my intellect means nothing. <br>My intellectual understanding meant like zilch except that at least it's a lens through which I was able to put into words a framework. That's really what "A Walk in the Physical" is. It's a framework for the thinking mind of the spiritually seeking intellect here, whether you're intellectual or not. It's a framework through which to try to approach those portions of us that transcend the form of Earth, including our thoughts, our Earth-based thoughts. That's a big step, but that is what I feel called to do, and I'm very passionate about it.<br><br><br>Well, and you've done such a beautiful job, and in this case, your intellect then becomes the tool to be able to do that effectively and bridge the science and spirituality. The page they had me go to is 49: "Don't take life so seriously. No one makes it out alive." Right? So, yes, it's so beautiful because a lot of the density that we've taken on—laughter—I've been coached to use laughter a lot as a way to break up density because sometimes we can't go straight to happiness. We have to find a way there, you know, that absolutely circumvents old patterns. <br>Yeah, yeah. So, it's a dense playground. So, what part can you play with that will give laughter and that you enjoy? What do you enjoy here? Well, what if I enjoy Netflix? Go watch Netflix. That's fine. You know what I'm saying? It's part of the playground. Yeah, I used to say watching videos of kittens helps you be happier. Just do that. Whatever reality—whatever you personally, genuinely, authentically enjoy.<br>You said something really interesting—being here at this time, it's like fourth or sixth graders trying to get to college in a year. It's like winning the lottery. I think I understand what you mean about that—about the growth opportunity. But I think that might be worth just exploring a little bit more here in our remaining time.<br>Sure. So, this dense alchemizing that we're talking about—oh man, what kind of a metaphor can I use? I mean, what comes to mind is like someone swinging a sword and trying to learn how to, I don't know, cut targets in half or something. The environment that we're at right now—we are trying to swing a sword that's most usually made out of wood with a thousand pounds on our back, with a blindfold on, and there's like 67 targets around us, and they're constantly moving. You know what I mean? <br>And then we can't hit a thing, and then we hit one, and we're like, "I got one," but like it almost looks like nothing happened. You know? I'm just saying that. Oh, the metaphor that Natalie Sudbon, the near-death experiencer, used is she said that we're seeing like heroes—like superheroes on the other side because we're like fighter jet pilots who are flying our jets upside down 20 feet off the ground. So, that's what I mean is that this level of rigor—so because it's not only the physical limitations being high, it's also that the human race is kind of a big mess. So, you combine those two things, and you've got a raucous, complex, chaotic, loud situation in which you're trying to wield love and authenticity. <br>That's tricky. That's really tricky. It's not just tricky; it's really hard. You know, it's like climbing Mount Everest is a metaphor I've used before. So, then you might say, "Well, why is climbing Mount Everest hard?" Well, because it's like cold, and there's no air up there, and you have to practice even just to get to base camp. It's like a big accomplishment. <br>That's like being human. Like, it takes a lot of soul experience even just to get to base camp, man, let alone climb the mountain and try to actually be loving and joyful in the midst of a society where, you know, all of our intentionality that's aligned with fear—like all the control of resources, we've normalized us-versus-them thinking everywhere. We've normalized fear-based patterns, victimization, powerlessness all over the place. How do you still choose to be you in the midst of that? <br>And then, in so doing, and in unlocking yourself, contribute to the growth and freedom of the whole? Because, by the way, you don't have to fix the whole. Don't worry about the whole. Just live your own life to the fullest and most authentic way. That's it. Because even a small shift in you, in your mind, in your heart, the whole consciousness sees it and hears it. Right?<br><br><br>So, what we're here to do is the way that we swing the sword, hit the targets, is find the love and the peace and the freedom and the joy in your life in whatever small way and actually do it. And it's okay if it's small. It's okay. It doesn't matter how big it is. It's fine. Quality of intention is what we're here to do, not size. The whole physical is a play anyway. That's not even real. But what's real is you—your consciousness, which wields intention of love or fear. That's it. That's the name of the game. So, that's why this is so valuable because we're in the midst of—maybe another metaphor might be like I lived in Beijing, China, for a while. <br>Trying to cross a street in Beijing, at least 24 years ago, it's a dangerous activity. You know, you could die just crossing the street because there's like cars and motorcycles—can relate. Yeah, we called it Frogger. I lived in Vietnam. We called it Frogger—trying to get Frogger. Yeah, exactly. We called it Frogger too. We would try to get in a group and wait until there's enough people, and then we would push our way through all the vehicles and hope none of us got killed. So, I would measure everywhere I had to walk by like how many streets can I cross—minimize the number of streets. Anyway, it's like that. It's crazy. The human experience is like bikes and motorcycles and cars, and it's total chaos. Now, how in the middle of that do you find your peace? How do you find true friendship, true love, true expression of creativity? <br>How do you be yourself when there are motorcycles clipping you metaphorically—whatever that means in your life? That is the opportunity. It's incredible. That's the alchemy. That is the alchemy. That is the alchemy. Like, how do you meet the cacophony—cacophony is a great word for the energetic environment of Earth. How do you meet the cacophony of fear-based intentionality that we have enshrined for all these years and change it? And changing it just means how do you live in joy where you are? How do you have compassion for someone next to you where you are? How do you be yourself—your real self, not the fake self, not the conditioned self, not the thing I was told for 30, 50, 60, 100 years? I mean, you can do that if you want.<br>I'm talking about the real you, man, like whoever you are, even if it's weak, even if it's painful, even if it's whatever. How do you—can you be you—the real you? That's the alchemy, man, right there. Because then, when you shift your intention with how you relate to it, it doesn't matter if the form itself doesn't immediately change. It will change. Actually, the physical universe can't help but respond to us in consciousness. But even putting that aside, even if you can't see the physical change, it doesn't matter. Your spirit is what's real. Your consciousness is what is real. Is your consciousness changing how it relates to the circumstance? That's the playing field—not the object, not the money. I mean, we have to work with money. You know, we have to work in the context that we're in. We have to do our best. But how are you—like, who are you basically in this context?<br><br><br>Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like the great inner disarmament. And that's like the only stuff. What do you mean by disarmament? Inner disarmament. So, like all the wounded motivation and the, you know, meeting the moment instead of anger, and, you know, you feel shame, for example. Shame bubbles up or gets triggered, and do you go for the jugular out of anger, or do you inner disarm? So, that brings up something. The reason I asked is you're commonly aligned with what I was thinking, so I just want to point something out. <br>The ego's pattern of going in anger for the jugular or in wielding even victimization—man, there's like, "Oh, I'm a victim, so look, I'm righteous now," or something. You know, yeah, all of those patterns—that's not real power. It's fake power. It's like a wooden sword that's not sharp or something. It doesn't actually work. Now, so that's why I'm lifting it up because when you say disarmament, what you're disarming yourself from is the fake power. Yeah, not the real. The real power is the love, acceptance, joy, freedom, openness. That's the real power. The real power is the space in this room doesn't care what I put in it. It will be okay. <br>It will exist unto itself. Consciousness is like that. That's why meditation can be so helpful, by the way—not to go too big of a tangent. How do we relate to our own thoughts? How do you relate to your inner dialogue? Do you know that that's not you? You're the consciousness. You're not the thoughts. How do you relate to that? Do you free yourself? Do you say, "Oh, I'm going to change that belief"? You can. No, flexibility. It's a thing. Yes, incredible flexibility. Yes, because the body will change. Like, we wear neural pathways. The body can't help but respond to you. It has no choice. So, like, you pick a new path, and it will start to create that path. It has no choice. You have the power right now. The change of momentum. Yeah, absolutely.<br>Well, and I mean, it seemed pretty apparent to me just in my own soul remembering that the only thing we take out of here is how we met the moment. It is. Amen. But yeah, I would say as we close out here, any of your thoughts on, you know, life review—kind of what's waiting for us as we shift out and then we take composite experience with us?<br><br><br>So, speaking to the alchemy, I don't know, I kind of joke like, "Sure, we have to have money here and all that. That's great stuff, and we can use it to expand as part of our expression and bust out of old ancestral limiting beliefs." I love all of that stuff. But at the end of the day, the only asset, if you will, we're taking with us is that who we are. Yeah, exactly. It's the consciousness and how the consciousness has learned and grown and all of that, you know, and affected others. Yeah, because the others are a part of you. Like, you know, they say life review—like, you experience how you affected other people from their perspective. That's because they are you. Like, love is not just like a nice thing. It's logical. It's the right way because the other is you. <br>So, you can take with you—was I able to actualize the celebration of the other as a part of myself? Even was I able—like when Jesus says, "Do unto others as you would do unto yourself," that's the most natural, of course, spiritual law because the other is yourself. So, we take that with us. So, when we have a life review, we look back. We don't get to take the things. There's no things. There's no objects. There's no bowling balls. There's no money. There's none of that. You're not in your body. It's like taking off a shirt. You can fight real hard to keep that shirt, man. You can, you know, you're not going to keep it. It's going away. But you are you. <br>The quality of your intention gets to keep the evolution. You get to keep. So, like, metaphorically, if being physical is like laying on a weight bench, and then throughout your life, people put different amounts of weight on the bar, and then sometimes it's harder to lift, and sometimes it's easier to lift, and sometimes it's really hard to lift. Lifting means choosing love and peace and joy. Lifting means acceptance. Lifting means taking ownership. Lifting the weight means, "Wow, I will be authentic even here," or, "I will face my fear in this circumstance that just arose. I will face my grief." Maybe grief is a heavy weight. "I will face and feel my grief, and I will learn and grow." Now, that's all the weight. You know, the weight is like the circumstance, the Earth, all the things. We put the weight back when we're done. We get off the bench, and metaphorically, we keep the muscle. Now, in this case, muscle means the evolution of your being—your who you are, your nature, your intention, your ability to respond to that heavy of a weight. <br>Okay, so then, not to be too tantalizing to the ego, but this is meaningful. Let's say on Earth, you learn how to lift 100 pounds. Let's say somebody was—I don't know, let's say you had a sickness like the being that I experienced, and you learned how to function through it. You learned how to keep perseverance. You learned how to find joy even with pain present. Okay, then physical life ends. No more pain. Pain's gone. You're still you, though. You learned how to lift 100 pounds of weight, and then you go to a reality system that's just—I'm just using numbers for the sake of numbers—but one one-hundredth the density. Okay, so now somebody hands you one pound. You can throw that thing down the street because that's not hard for you now because you did the 100 pounds. One pound is nothing. <br>And so, that's why when Bob Monroe, the out-of-body explorer, I heard him say this years after I shared my experience because what he said is exactly what I experienced. He said that beings who had graduated the physical were like gods in higher systems. They had so much ability and power and depth of knowing and depth of feeling. They could do things with their intent, with their thought alone, that was like a godlike amount of influence because we have pushed against the ultimate density, and in so doing, we seek to enhance and grow the ultimate strength. You see, the spiritual strength, which is love and pure intention and the integration of experience itself, is like a refinement of the quality of being that we then get to apply in higher systems. You know?<br>Yeah, yeah. Back to your opening story of the being that you encountered must have had some of these qualities that you're just—yes, absolutely. He was a master in this certain quality. It was like he could feel things and do things that I was not even remotely capable of. I couldn't even perceive them. Yeah, yeah. But you know, that's what we're doing. We're growing up. Yeah, yeah. It's beautiful. It's so beautiful. I know that this is going to help so many people who hear it because, you know, this is a dense place, as you said. <br>This is no joke—not for newbies, not for the light, not for the faint of heart. No, right? Exactly. And people have different levels of it too. Some people are on level 20 difficulty, and some are on level 50. Right? You know, it's always impressed me even once you're here—the vibrational divide that exists is huge. Once you're here, what's possible? Yeah, yeah. So, I really—I'm just so grateful for your time and your energy. It comes through in volumes, and I know people will be able to feel that. So, thank you for all of that.<br>Thank you. My wife has the stomach flu right now, and I felt queasy all day, so this hopefully it'll be okay, but like this is like, "Okay, I'm just going to choose to be present anyway." Yeah, we'll see what the body does. Awalkinthephysical.com—is that the best for people to go find your book and more information about you? Yeah, awalkinthephysical.com. The book is available online for free to be read online for free. It's a PDF on Google Books that you can just click on the link and read it. Or it's on Amazon in print or Kindle or on audiobook on Audible. And the website also has a bunch of talks and, you know, other places I've shared. And I'm also happy to try to respond by email if people reach out, though lately I have not been able to keep up. I'm receiving too many emails, but I do try to respond when I can. It's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com</a>.<br>Yeah, thank you for that. I think the last thing that is being invited in is what's so wonderful is, you know, like you said in the beginning, you're you know, you're a guy walking the Earth walk too. You got your bills to pay and all of that. So, it's really nice to hear from someone who's in the trenches. And I guess it's just what's being invited in is just any sort of daily kind of—I don't know if it's a mantra or a reflection that you have that just really helps you navigate everything there is to navigate being human at this time.<br>So, yeah, so I remind myself this is an illusion. And when I mean that, this is a playground. Like, because I find myself falling into seriousness sometimes, like at work, you know, or an illness or something, you know, or a social interaction that's less than pleasant or something, you know, and then I fall into seriousness. So, I try to pause. Eckhart Tolle talks about having one breath of presence throughout the day. Just turn your attention—because here's the thing, okay, this is the little cheat, okay, this is what pops to mind. I discovered this is so simple, but it's so powerful. My thoughts aren't that important. And so, what I mean is, every time I sit down to meditate, I typically end up feeling, "Oh, I've been thinking my thoughts are really important. I got this thing I got to do. I got this bill I got to pay. I got this really everything is important." I try to meditate, and it's like, "Nope, boss, we got thoughts. <br>These are really important." Guess what? They're not. So, I tell myself every time, "No, no, no, remember, it's okay. Like, none of the thoughts are so important that you can't put them down and be present." Love that. And be alert. Yeah, and put your attention on awareness itself. There's no form that is more important than spirit itself, which gives rise to form. So, I try to remind myself of that throughout my day. Like, don't take it so seriously. Yeah, basically, don't take it so seriously, man. It's okay. Like, it's—I'm reminded one last comment of there's a near-death experiencer named Amy Call, and when she came back from her NDE, she was still seeing through the God lens, through the high spirit lens. And these two cable guys came to her front door, and they said, "We're here to fix your cable." <br>And she said she couldn't stop laughing the whole time they were there. She was like dying because it was the funniest thing that these powerful multi-dimensional beings were taking it so seriously that they needed to fix her cable. But we all do that, man. Like, I do that. Like, sometimes I look at myself, and I go, "Oh wow, I'm really taking this seriously today." You know, like, it's okay. I'm not really a cable guy. I'm not really a human, actually. You know, that sounds crazy. You're not actually a human. Whoever you are listening today, you're you having the experience of humanhood, creaturehood, the body. That's all. You're actually not the human. That's it. Exactly.<br>Well, and no coincidence that was a theme today in calls was reintroducing playfulness as a balance to a system out of balance. And I think it really is the next leading edge. I think we'll see a lot more of that introduced in leadership development and human resource development. It's a big missing component. There's a Seth quote that I love that I put in the book too. It's, "On one hand, you take life too seriously. On the other hand, you don't take play seriously enough." I love it. What a perfect, perfect note to end on. Thank you so much, Christian. Thank you so much. I'm honored to be here. When I feel into the energy of what you're offering, I'm just so honored to meet you in the physical. It's an honor. So, thank you for the work you're doing. Likewise, thank you. Take care, and I'm sending you all wonderful energy for a quick template shift and recovery. Thank you. Thank you very much. Take care. Thank you. Have a great day. Thank you.]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2024/beyond-conscious-a-conversation-with-christian-sundberg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2024/Beyond Conscious A Conversation with Christian Sundberg.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:06:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[GOOD VIBRATIONS PODCAST.

 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=oClZ7s0uz6A<br>19 FEB 2024<br><br><br>Good Vibrations<br>
Welcome to episode 247, and my guest today is Christian Sundberg. Welcome on, brother.  <br>Christian: Thank you very much, Mark. Thanks for having me.  <br>Mark: Well, I thought now could be a good time to have this conversation, as I've been going through a bit of a spiritual crisis of faith of late, you might say. As my regular viewers of my videos will know, just to fill you in, I've been through various different phases in my life. I went through a childhood where I was raised in a Christian Church of England school. I didn't really think much of it beyond that. In my early 20s, I felt differently about the world, and it felt like something had happened. <br>I just didn't know what, and I allowed myself to be guided into a Christian Evangelical Church, where I stayed for four years. I left that after that period, feeling somewhat disillusioned and jaded by the whole experience. I became an atheist for about 15 years, then I shook myself out of that and came to accept that, of course, there is a supreme creative force behind all things. I went through a spiritual phase, which lasted another best part of 15 years. But just recently, I've been really starting to question the true nature of what we refer to as God. <br>In a video that I put out the other week, I was questioning whether God is a benevolent, loving being or force which wants the best for us, as we prefer to think, or whether it could actually be the opposite—some kind of demonic force, some kind of demiurge, a lesser god. Because there's all kinds of evidence to suggest that this is a realm specially constructed for pain, suffering, and fear. So maybe you can help me out with that.  <br>Just for the listeners, perhaps you'd like to get into what you generally talk about in your interviews and broadcasts, and some of the interesting experiences that have happened to you in this lifetime. We'll just sort of set the scene there and see where it takes us.  <br>Christian: Yeah, sure. Thank you, Mark. So, I am coming from a place where I have had a pre-birth experience and also out-of-body experiences. Pre-birth experience meaning, at the age of 30, I spontaneously had memory of the incarnation process returned to me. I remember existing in the state prior to the human experience, and I remember choosing this life and why. So, that's the main context. <br>But it's broader than that. That's just the part that people tend to focus on. I've also had out-of-body experiences, and now our higher nature is very normal to me. The human experience is arising, and it's a highly strange and limiting experience, but it is non-native, and it's not what we really are. I kind of see through that and feel through that. I've had some energetic sense that has arisen since my awakening about 13 years ago.  <br>I wrote a book called A Walk in the Physical. It's available for free on my website. It's not about money. Through it, I wish to share what we are doing here on Earth, what is the meaning and value of the human experience. Those have been my questions. That's my main passion—sharing what is the value of this experience, why are we here.  <br>Your question that you kicked off the discussion about, regarding whether God is a benevolent force or the opposite—yeah, wow, okay. So, very much unconditionally loving is the nature of the source from which we come. So loving that we have the choice to engage in deep contrast for the purposes of the expansion of what we are, if we so choose. We do choose to come; it's not forced upon us.  <br>The problem is, there are only really two major issues: one is ignorance, which just means we don't remember what we are, and the other is fear. Fear just means that we have yet to evolve this. There's some aspect of these extreme constraints that we yet reject and push away and have a problem with. When fear is there, ego arises, and all sorts of shenanigans arise out of ego and fear—all sorts of nastiness. But that's just our own fear giving rise to that because of the extremeness of the constraints that we've agreed to come experience here on Earth.  <br>I touched on a lot there, but just at a very high level, we can kick off the conversation with that.  <br><br><br>Mark: Sure. Well, that sets the scene nicely. So, what happened to you at age 30 to spark that experience? Was that a singular moment of epiphany, a singular event?  <br>Christian: Not so much. I had some pre-birth memory up until the age of five when I was a kid, but I forgot it by five or six. So, in my early adult life, I had no awareness of it at all. Then, at age 30, I took up a long-term meditation practice, and after a few months, I had my first non-physical experience. It was so eye-opening. It was like, "What the heck? Something's really going on here.<br>I've got to keep going." So, I continued meditating, and one day, it was just there. It wasn't like a big epiphany. It was like there was just so much I was aware of, I guess is the best way you could put it. I could see and remember things I hadn't been aware of or seen before. It was like someone had just blown leaves off the ground, and there was the grass. It was the most normal thing in the world.  <br>In fact, when the pre-birth awareness returned, I didn't think of it as strange at all. I was sharing it with somebody one day, and they said, "You know, that's really extraordinary. You should share that." It hadn't even occurred to me that it was extraordinary because, when you are at that level of awareness, the higher context that we've experienced is very normal. It's not strange. It's not unusual. The human experience is the strange thing, actually—these extreme constraints that we've agreed to experience for a while on Earth. That's the strange thing.  <br><br><br>Mark: Why is it that some, such as yourself, have the ability to remember past lives, but the vast overwhelming majority don't?  <br>Christian: Yeah, so I'm not special in some way. It's not like that. In part, I did ask in my pre-birth experience to have a small amount of memory this time, to not forget everything. The veil—the constraints that are in consciousness that go along with being physical and not remembering—that's just part of the game here. Not remembering is built in, you could say, to the simulation. Like, if you really want to be a human, you've got to be the human. You can't be all the experiences of the whole universe. You need to be just you. Like, if you want to experience getting up and eating your breakfast, then you need to be the human that gets up and eats the breakfast.  <br>But I did remember asking for a small amount of memory. It still did lead me by five or six, even though that's true. I know that I'm not special or unique in some way. We all have access to our deeper selves when we are willing to let go enough of everything that we're not. Right now, what happens is we get really lost into identification with form—form meaning sensory data, thoughts, stories, the world, the objects, the places, all the stuff that's arisen that the mind is so focused on. That's not really what we are. Even the thoughts that arise in our minds are like little dreams. Each thought is like a little dream. It's not really the full you.  <br>So, it's a matter of taking the time and the focus to return your awareness to what you really are, very objectively. Not trying to make anything up. This is not about a new story or a new neat thing. No, this is about a personal experience of what you really are—turning your awareness back towards your awareness and exploring it very objectively and with great alertness. In that, non-physical experiences can very naturally arise, kind of on their own. It seems like on their own because it's not the doing human portion of us that's doing things on Earth. It's not really who we are anyway. It's really just that we're looking away from the movie screen such that we spontaneously become aware that we were always in the movie theater. That's a metaphor, of course, but it's the best way I can think to put that.  <br><br><br>Mark: Okay. So, what I was most interested in was whether, in the spirit realm before we incarnate into these meat-suit bodies, there is consent. You've already answered that by saying there is, so we fully agree to come into these lives. Do we know exactly what we're letting ourselves in for—the challenges that we're experiencing?  <br>Christian: Actually, we do. First of all, let me speak to the consent part here. The soul is a part of God. So, what I mean is, you are a drop in the ocean. You're like a piece of God. You could think of it that way at the soul level, at the deepest level. So, what has greater authority than that? Nothing. There's no such thing as something that has greater authority than that which is the fundamental substrate of what is. It's the ultimate authority. It doesn't have a greater thing.  <br>The only way that it can seem to be so deeply veiled to itself is to surrender itself. The primary portion of my pre-birth experience that is on my mind commonly, and that I've shared about, is that I remember so vividly actually for two lives—this one and a preceding one—the acceptance of the veil. The process of surrendering my control, surrendering my power to a cloak, or something. I don't know how to articulate it, but it's a surrendering of oneself to the limitations, a giving over of oneself to the limitations.  <br>In a previous experience, I had actually accepted the veil, but then when I got here, I was like, "I'm not doing this. This is not happening." I had so much fear rise up as soon as I was bodily, even though I was still in the womb. In that experience, I rejected the veil because I thought, "I'm not doing this. I know that I'm stronger than the veil. I'm going to fight my way back out." And I did, but in doing so, I killed the fetus that was to be my body.  <br>I'm just lifting that up because I experienced fear upon arriving, even though I had positive intentions for that life, because I personally wasn't fully prepared for the level of challenge that this level of constraint offers. The veil is like a plummeting in vibration of one's being from being all that is and connected in the most blissful, ecstatic, fully knowledgeable way, down, down, lower, lower. I could say the word "lower" a hundred times, and it would not do justice to the ridiculous plummet in vibration that one feels in the body of one's awareness down into these ridiculously extreme constraints that we experience here on Earth. Being bodily is like being shoved inside of a tiny tuna can. It's really uncomfortable, but that can only happen in a surrendering to the constraints, to the veil.  <br>We do that because, pre-life, we see the amazing opportunity. Now, the ego does not like that, of course, because we've got all sorts of pain and all sorts of rejection where we reject and have pain, which means we have fear. We don't want to hear that. No, we don't like it. We just don't like this. But the thing is, we have actually chosen to be engaged in something that can challenge us. What else can challenge God, you could say, other than to create something so dense that we are trying?  <br>Here we are. I'm not making light of the difficulties of the world. I'm really not. I've suffered a lot of trauma and pain and sickness in this life, and I knew that I would pre-life. But I knew then, and I know now, that the great limitations, the great constraints, the great pain—it actually has an incredible opportunity that it presents to us. It's not that pain is good. It's not what I'm saying. <br>Pain is not like that at all. It's just that, as a metaphor, because we have to rely on metaphors because this is so hard to describe in earthly language, it's like, why would you lay down on a weight bench and actually push up 200 lbs rather than 10? Why would you ever do that? That's hard. It's heavy. It could crush you. Yes, it could. It's very heavy. But we do that because, man, you can grow in ways that are just not possible with less constraints.  <br>We see that opportunity, so we agree to dive in and get our hands really dirty. And here we are.  <br><br><br>Mark: Right. I mean, people will ask, why would anyone choose to come in as a sexually abused child, or a torture victim, or to be blind, or to spend their life in pain in a wheelchair, or die of cancer at a young age? These sorts of things, when others choose to come in as millionaires and live lives of luxury and wealth and great pleasure. It seems to be unfairly skewed.  <br>Christian: It's important to keep in mind that a given earthly circumstance is not already charged. It's not like a millionaire is always being better than being a non-millionaire. That's not how it works. Consciousness has to apply the meaning to the context and then work with it. For some people, even being a millionaire and having very few health challenges, for example, that might be a very challenging life for them, for whatever reason. Whereas someone else might choose to engage a circumstance which, to another person, might seem unfathomable, but they're strong, and they can process it, and they can really learn something through it.  <br>Now, when I say "learn," I don't mean intellectual learning. I mean there's intellectual learning that happens, of course, here on Earth. I'm talking about a learning of the being by being something—by actually experiencing some perspective. It's often in the opposite perspectives of some spectrum that we learn the most and that we can grow the most.  <br>As an example, let's say that you, as a soul, forever want to know what it's like to be powerful and to really enjoy the power that we really are. You might choose a life of great powerlessness. Perhaps that helps you understand power. Perhaps it's an aspect of a long pattern. There's a lot of different avenues it could go down, but it could be a way for you to integrate some experience and even grow some quality through it. Perhaps you're trying to really evolve a certain kind of fortitude, for instance.  <br>Now, that's very difficult for the ego to understand because it's just upset. It's just pissed. I experienced trauma when I was 22. I had a health condition in Chongqing, China. My nervous system was burned out by a potassium overdose, and I was in neurological agony for months. I did nothing but cry and shake back and forth. I had no memory up until the age of 22 for about five or six years. I was very traumatized, went through years of counseling, and found this incredible fear at the bottom of it.  <br>I know now that that fear is what I came to process. I came to process that fear. I came to experience that because the opportunity to serve the whole by integrating that—by really coming all the way down into that very low vibration and to really actually integrate it and not reject it, to actually feel it, to actually face the darkness all the way, man, all the way, with vulnerability, with humility, with patience, with willingness to feel—it's about the quality of intention that we bring into these things. It's not about the circumstances. It's all about quality of intent.  <br>The contexts change. The physical changes. The body changes. Like, your 5-year-old body is gone. You're still here. It's not who you are. You're not this body either. When this body's over, you'll still be you. But what you always are is you—your consciousness. And consciousness, what does it do? It wields intention. It makes choices.  <br>So, what we're here to do is to refine and grow our ability to wield a quality of intention, which means, can we really choose love rather than fear, even when it's hard, man? Even when the constraints are off the charts. It's one thing to be on the other side and say, "Oh, I'm kind. I can be kind in any circumstance." It's another thing to be here and have someone flick you off on the street after you've had a long day, and then you see that. That's the value.  <br>So, it's not just that the circumstances themselves, we apply the meaning to it all. Also, part of what we're learning to do is, how do I frame what I've experienced? How do I use it? How do I realize and feel and know that I'm deeper than the constraints and the circumstances that have arisen? That's a very personal process.  <br><br><br>Mark: Right. So, when you abandoned the new life that had been lined up for you, and you caused your mother to have a miscarriage, and you went back to the spirit world, could you have called it a day there if you'd chosen and just said, "I'm never going back"? You obviously chose to come back, but could you have made the decision to not incarnate into this world anymore?  <br>Christian: Yes, but the thing is, this is hard to describe. The answer is yes. We never have to continue. It's like going to college. It's like, you don't have to go if you go Monday, Tuesday, this week, next week, the month after. You could just stop on any given day. I mean, you don't have to go back. No one's really making you, except in this metaphor, it's pretty bad because you're not taking out a bunch of money to go to college. You can just stop when you like.  <br>But the thing is, you know who you are now, and we call that karma. Karma just means you are who you are. From that side, you can see, "Oh, wow. I am the certain person in these circumstances. Wow, I chose that. I chose this certain thing. Hmm, wow. I could really grow and balance out, might be a good way to put it. If I could reface that and reintegrate that, that would be a great service to the whole." And then, you know, that would be helpful.  <br>We make the choices from love, not from "must do." There's no "must do." There's nothing, in fact. Right now, no matter who you are listening, no matter what's going on in your life, at the deepest level, there is nothing you need to do. Nothing. The need to do something doesn't feel good because it's not the truth. The truth is, you're completely free. You're completely free, and you're completely understood. You're completely loved. Totally loved. That's the starting point.  <br>From there, we may choose even to do something as crazy and extreme as committing ourselves into a veil where we don't remember who we really are, to see what we choose, how we do now that we're here. We upset most of us because, what the heck, this world can be pretty dark at times. But that is just an indicator that we have yet to grow. We have yet to learn. We have yet to actualize our true loving nature, even when the constraints are this high. It's about love, you know?  <br><br><br>Mark: Right. So, there's no judgment waiting for us when we exit these lives. I mean, I've heard David Icke express it as, "There's no God with a machine gun saying, 'Get into that body, or else.'" So, we are choosing, right? We are choosing ourselves to come here. And if there is any kind of judgment, it's us effectively judging ourselves from a higher state of consciousness.  <br>Christian: Yes, that's exactly right. We judge ourselves. It's all understood. Not only do we judge ourselves, but when we have our life review and we review a life, we are often offered huge amounts of love and comfort and caring and comforting because they know that we're going to see we made some fearful choices and hurt other people. It might be hard for us to see who we've really been. That's how much we're loved.  <br>It's not like you're punished because you made some choice. It's like, no, you just see who you were, but you also see the entire context. So often, when you see, okay, so from the other side, if someone else hurt you, you also see their full context. So many times, we hurt others because we've been hurt. From that point of view, you can see, "Oh my gosh, they hurt me because they were hurt by all these other people in this chain." And not only were they hurt, but, "Oh my, they are such brave and strong, you know, they're brave and strong themselves." And you see their qualities and how they're doing their best with what's been given to them.  <br>That's how we see each other, and that's how spirit sees us. But then, when we look at ourselves, it's not that wisdom is automatic either. We look back, and we feel exactly how we affected others. We feel exactly who we are. We know who we are. We still have to make a decision about how to use that information—if we choose to come back and do something about it or not, or whatever. It's all about free will choice.  <br><br><br>Mark: Eric Dubay put out a brilliant video just the other week, likening this life experience to a boat at sea. The analogy was, there's a bunch of people on this boat. Nobody on the boat knows where they came from. They don't know where the boat's headed. They've got no recollection of how they got there, and nobody seems to have all the answers for anything. All they can see around them is just endless ocean—no land in sight. There's no guidebook, there's no charts or maps. And I thought, that's a pretty good metaphor for these lives.  <br>So, what is the point of the memory wipe? What's the point of us coming in and forgetting everything that we previously learned in prior incarnations? Because while you seem to have some recollection of your previous lives, most evidently don't. So, people will ask, how are we supposed to grow and evolve if that's what these lives are for, if we can't remember what we previously did and learned? Wouldn't it make more sense for us to be able to pull that accumulated knowledge in with us with each new life?  <br>Christian: So, let's not call it knowledge because if you're thinking that the learning is behavioral or intellectual, then yeah, you would need the knowledge. But that's not the type of learning that we're doing. It's a learning—a growth of the being by being something. A growth of the being means a refinement of its quality of intent, and that you do keep. Your quality, your virtues, you could say, you keep. <br>You grow in that way. You might have to relearn new context, but if you want to be sailing on the ocean out in the middle of nowhere, and you want to see how you do, you've got to be sailing on the ocean. You've got to be out on the ocean. You've got to have no guidebook. That's the name of the game. That's what makes it like that. That's going to be scary, right?  <br>Well, now that it's prompting fear, that is the opportunity. You see, the fact that now you're on an ocean, you have to decide what to do. That is the offering. I don't want to use the word "excitement" because I don't want to make it sound like some masochistic thing. It's not masochism, but that is the offering—that you don't know.  <br>And then, from life to life, you do keep what you've learned at the being level. It's not about intellectual learning, though intellectual learning might occur. It might reoccur. You might be back in a human context and relearn things, and you might actually learn them faster because you've actually done this before, even if you don't remember it. Your being knows.  <br>So, that growth of the being is definitely retained. It's just that that doesn't require the content in the game to be updated. So, metaphorically, if you go into a video game, let's say you reload and start over, your character doesn't have anything when you start over. It starts at blank, but you, the player, actually are better at playing the game now. So, in our case, that's true, even if that means you don't remember.  <br><br><br>Mark: Okay. So, we're going to be surrounded by people who have potentially been here hundreds of times before, and others who've been here just a handful of times before, and presumably some that are here for the first time, right? And we're sort of mingling with these people at different stages of development and experience.  <br>Christian: Definitely. Absolutely. So, when we see, and then we have to be subject to—I'm not differentiating between a person with one experience or a thousand lifetimes. But I'm just saying that this is kind of like an equalizing context. And that now, if some person makes some decision to harm you physically, now you have to deal with it. You see, so even because the reason I say that is because, in higher realms, there is like a vibrational geography going on—a geography that's based on nature of being and quality of intention and focus of purpose.  <br>It's very much like we basically go where we resonate. That's a simple way to put that. Whereas, on Earth, this is the place we come if you want to shove a bunch of people that might not resonate together and see what happens.  <br>Mark: Right. Might that explain the concept of what people refer to as NPCs—non-player characters, or normies? You know, regular members of society who just go along to get along, and they behave the same as most other people, and go shopping, and watch TV, and eat junk food, and all this. Would those be people who might be early on in their developmental stages, and maybe they've not had that many previous lives, and they're learning their lessons that they came for slowly and gradually, versus those who seem to have more meaningful lives who perhaps are more advanced on the scale?  <br>Christian: Well, we can't judge. Yeah, it does make sense. We can't judge the meaning of a life based on whether someone did this thing or not that other thing. But I will say that, when you use the term NPC—non-player character—in the truest sense, the way I interpret that term would be, is there anybody walking around that's an avatar that no soul is playing? Right? So, part of the simulation.  <br>I think that actually does happen, but I think it's very rare. But anyway, to your question about normies, many people that are less awake is just because, in many times, where fear is greater, which means, in general, experience is less in a given area. I'm not judging and making this a new duality because we transcend all duality. But where experience is less, then there may be less awakeness, and less awakeness tends to yield a conventional, non-alert lifestyle.  <br>But that's not judging. I'm just saying that level of experience does impact how someone is going to react to the societal norms and what their soul is calling them to do. As we awaken and grow, awakening and spiritual growth tend to be synonymous. As that occurs, we tend to have increased awareness about possible decisions we could make, and we tend to make those decisions in the direction of love, in whatever that means for the individual. And that can mean many different things. So, I'm trying not to be too specific because I'm not judging a given lifestyle.  <br><br><br>Mark: But yeah, so you mentioned the simulation just there. Do you place any stock in this idea, which is becoming ever more popular, it seems, that this may not be original creation? This might be some kind of overlay or copy of what was there before.  <br>Christian: What do you mean by overlay or copy?  <br>Mark: So, the idea is that we might not be living in God's, if you want to use that term, original creation, but that it was somehow hijacked by some other kind of entity, which people often refer to as a demiurge, which might have steered it off in other directions. And so, we're living in a sort of virtual reality copy of what was there previously. This is not our natural state. It's bastardized and unnatural in some way.  <br>Christian: Well, yeah, that makes sense. So, I've heard that. To me, that starts to fall into the soul trap category.  <br>Mark: Yeah, exactly. It goes hand in hand with the idea that our souls have been tricked into this trap.  <br>Christian: Yeah, right. I very much do not agree with that, and I think that's a really good example of how we take earthly learned patterns like deception, entrapment, and then, because we are afraid of deception and afraid of entrapment, and because we experience it from each other here, boy, we'll impose that right up the chain. And now we're afraid that that's happening to us at a larger spiritual level.  <br>Oh my gosh, it's kind of like the idea of hell. It's like, we're already feeling separate from the whole, so let's create an idea that you can be tormented forever if you don't pick the right belief. Oh my gosh, it's just not the truth. The fundamental truth is unconditional love and absolute freedom and love and joy and peace. It's just that's the truth. And from that deepest layer, there's no deception. In fact, there's no separation.  <br>So, your question kind of implies that there's such a thing as this original universe, and now there's a new one, and that this second one has got all messed up. There is no separation at all. There is no distance. What I mean is, there's only the experience of a virtual set of form—locations, ideas, objects, sensory data, sight, sound, touch—arising within consciousness. And consciousness is already one. It's already whole. It's already perfect, you could say, even though we're simultaneously growing. It's already the one thing. It doesn't need anything.  <br>So, I'm lifting that up because, yeah, as soon as we start falling into an idea of, "Oh, now I'm in a new well," we feel like we're in a prison here, so we create another idea for a prison. And it's actually doing us ourselves a great disservice because we are powerful creative beings, and what we believe is what we tend to create.  <br>So, in the astral, for instance, people who believe in imprisonment, they're going to experience some kind of exemplification, actualization of imprisonment. And so, now we're kind of sharing these scary ideas with each other. We're all running around like, "Oh my God," like a big fear orgy. That's irresponsible to have. I'm just saying, at a large level, for the powers that be to share fear all the time, like on mainstream news, for instance, it's not very responsible to fill our mind space and our focus with the negative when we are powerful creative beings who are giving rise not only to our world but to other non-physical reality systems as well.  <br>Mark: Right. Yeah, that's the whole thing about that soul trap, tricked by the light idea. I think we spend our lives being deceived and lied to here, as you say. It's tempting for some to imagine that that continues beyond this realm, back into the spirit world, which is a horrific thought. That's absolutely nightmarish—that even when these lives are done, we can still face monumental deception and duplicity.  <br>Christian: Yeah, it's not the case. So, like, there's a simple—I don't mean to oversimplify this, but this is a pretty good litmus test: if you consider an idea, and deep down in your bones, it doesn't feel good, it's not the truth. I mean, honestly, does it feel good, the idea that if you die, you're going to get stuck in an incarnation trap? If that doesn't feel good, it's because you're buying into a perception that is not in alignment with the truth. The truth feels good. The truth is unconditional love and total freedom and total joy and total peace.  <br>So, when you are in alignment—when your perception, your alignment, your identification is in alignment with the truth—you feel good. Whereas, when we make up scary ideas and then scare the crap out of each other, it doesn't feel good. And that's a really clear gauge. Like, yeah, you're buying into a perception that is not in alignment with the truth.  <br>Mark: The idea of reincarnation really does not appeal to me. The idea of coming back to this place and going through all this stuff all over again really is not of great appeal. I find the concept of reincarnation to be quite horrific myself.  <br>Christian: If I may, it's probably because you find this life to be horrific.  <br>Mark: Yes, I do.  <br>Christian: So, that's the issue, right? It's not that reincarnation is horrific. It's that this life is horrific.  <br>Mark: I find this world to be hell—a living hell.  <br>Christian: Yeah, so I'm not making light of that, and I'm not speaking for any other person. I am not making light of it at all. But I will say simply this—and this is not a challenge—it's just that fear is what's hell. Fear meaning our rejection of the circumstances that have arisen—rejection of the pain, rejection of not being understood, rejection of a society that doesn't understand us, or having to work all the time, or having a disease, or having to suffer. The rejection itself is the suffering. The vast majority of the suffering is our rejection.  <br>Now, we don't typically take ownership for that because that's very hard. The ego's first job is to blame the world. So, I'm not making light of the comment at all, even as I say that, because I've gone through incredible amounts of pain, and I'm not making light of that. I'm really not. And I know that that might scratch someone's ego the wrong way, and that's okay. You know, if it happens, it's fine. It's okay.  <br>I'm just lifting up that we actually have the power. This is like the world is like Earth is like a big mirror that's very, very dense. It's like a very challenging mirror, but it's neutral. But it's very high constraint. And so, now you're looking in the mirror. What do we see in the mirror? We see only how we are relating to the world. Like, if you look at your own face in the mirror, you can't make the mirror smile. You have to smile. The mirror can't do anything but be there.  <br>It's kind of like how the physical is. Consciousness is first. So, we have a lot more authority and a lot more sovereignty and a lot more power than we typically believe. And the claim of the ego of rejection is like a temporary false power. True power is actually an acceptance. And I know that's very hard. I'm not making light of it.  <br>Mark: Okay. Well, your answers are very similar to ones that I got from a dude that I interviewed many years ago by the name of Dannion Brinkley. You know about him?  <br>Christian: Yes.  <br>Mark: He was a guy who, if I recall correctly, was struck by lightning, and he says he clinically died for a few minutes. He's got memories of going outside of his body and looking back down and seeing himself on a hospital stretcher and such. And then, in the spirit realm, he made the decision to go back into his body and continue his life. His name's quite interesting—Brinkley—because he was like on the brink.  <br>Christian: Oh, was that the name of his book? Back from the Brink or something?  <br>Mark: Maybe. I don't remember.  <br>Christian: It could be.  <br>Mark: So, his response was very similar to what you've said there. So, you know, he claims to have had similar experiences.  <br>Christian: So, let me just give a brief example. Okay, so my gallbladder collapsed—failed—a few years ago. I had a lung collapse when I was 26, and I had 10 days in the hospital with a tube in my chest. That was very painful. And then, my gallbladder failed a few years ago. That was very physically painful. These are just some examples of very high pain experiences.  <br>There's a profound difference between the two, though, because I rejected the lung collapse. And when my gallbladder was failing, I spent six weeks doing nothing but crying all day. It hurt so bad, and it took a long time to get into surgery. But the thing is, that wasn't automatically charged. Like, pain arises within consciousness. We still get to decide what to do with it.  <br>Now, I know that it's very alarming to the body, but the thing is, consciousness is always first. There's nothing that takes place outside of consciousness. And consciousness is the author, the experiencer. It has the ultimate power. So, we can actually use the challenging circumstances that arise to see how we are relating to them. Can we accept them rather than reject them? What meaning are we putting on them?  <br>And even then, you know, we can find that our consciousness is actually deeper than all that crap. It's not necessarily easy to find when we're in rejection. This is the place that tests us to that extreme where we get traumatized, man. We get hurt to high heck, and we have so much fear and rejection. Trauma is the key. Trauma is just happening an awful lot because fear is trauma, and we have a lot of fear.  <br><br><br>Mark: Are there consequences for taking the option of suicide?  <br>Christian: So, every choice has a consequence. Every choice, every thought, every intention. And we are responsible for every single one of them. What I mean by that is not judgment. It's that there's a perfect cause and effect balance going on. So, we can call that karma. It's a simple word that simply means you are who you are, like I said, and you are responsible for exactly who you are.  <br>Suicide tends to be very damaging for oneself and others, of course. One's own body, by definition, it's a killing of one's own body. And so, that is like not an automatic escape. Some individuals may actually have that as an exit point, maybe even in the plan, potentially.  <br>I'm reminded of the book The Afterlife of Billy Fingers. Maybe that was—I don't remember exactly, but something I remember him sharing something in that book about how the way that he died was planned. Anyway, so I'm just saying that we can't judge it based on the action itself. It's again the intention—the quality of the intention. Why are we choosing what we're choosing?  <br>And often, suicide is done out of incredible fear that has our decision space—a Tom Campbell term—getting smaller and smaller and smaller. We feel more and more and more limited. We feel more controlled. We feel more depressed. It keeps getting worse and worse to the point where we see no other way out. Or, you know, the decision space has gotten so small because that's the nature of fear. It's reductive, contractive, rejecting. And in the end, wow, we'll even reject life itself.  <br>That's as extreme as it can get. When you've reached that point, you're all out of other options.  <br><br><br>Mark: Yeah, I mean, I can't judge based on a given circumstance, but generally speaking, yes.  <br>Christian: It's just I'm saying that because the extremeness of one being's experience is not known by another. Some people here are experiencing some ridiculously difficult challenges that other people might not even be able to conceive of.  <br>Mark: So, would you say that there's an interplay between pre-planned circumstances in life—so, before we come in, we have a loose idea of who we're going to be, what part of the world we're going to be born into, who our parents and family are going to be, what kind of thing we're going to do for a living—and free will? So, free will is at play in terms of the individual decisions we make on a day-to-day basis, but the basic framework of what we're going to do is already decided. Is that correct?  <br>Christian: Yeah, right. We sign up for the context, and then we make choices, and then we see. Like, in my pre-birth experience, I reviewed a huge—I can only describe it like a flowchart—starting at the time of my incarnation and working out all the way to possible exit points. It was like laying a tree on its side and starting at the trunk, and the tree expanded out into the branches.  <br>So, what was the thing that decided which branch of the tree would actualize? My free will choice-making and the free will choice-making of every other player in the game. So, that wasn't certain, but there was a very clear knowing of the probabilities—actually like a probability tree, you could say—where certain branches were very thick and likely, and others were less thick and less likely.  <br>And that was not only the context, which includes the body, all its biological constraints, all the societal constraints, all the context is seen and known and understood, but then also the choice-making for myself and others that would guide which path I would actualize.  <br><br><br>Mark: Okay. What happens to us between lives? Because I've heard you say that you've got some memory of this.  <br>Christian: So, it's difficult to comment categorically because it's a little like if you asked a video game character in a video game what happens on Earth. Well, there's a lot of stuff that can happen on Earth that a character in Minecraft couldn't possibly even conceive of. Right? Like, if you tell a character in Minecraft, "After this game, I'm going to go get a burger," they don't know what that might mean.  <br>I'm just framing it that way first because we're talking about a huge multi-dimensional creation, and the soul already transcends that creation. So, the way I interpret your question is, what does the personality portion of the self do after physical death? And that is a very personal question. It's unique to each individual, depending on their nature, where they are in evolution, what forms they're associated with.  <br>Like, someone who is very deeply associated with some form—like, say, going to work—they might choose, whether they know that they're making the choice or not, to temporarily experience a thought-responsive reality system in a lower astral realm or something, where they go to work for a while until they're ready to realize, "Oh, there's a much bigger picture going on here."  <br>But some people don't need that. Some will go directly into much higher levels that vastly transcend this local context. I can say at least that I experienced a realm of golden light that was blissful, and I could travel at will across our universe and beyond. And that I was super full of freedom. I don't know how to articulate this. It's like frolicking—just expressing one's being in a movement of consciousness that has outcomes or activities that you couldn't possibly even describe here on Earth.  <br>Mark: A big part of this sort of "tricked by the light," soul trap idea, which is really popular right now in conspiracy circles, it seems, is people say that they go through this tunnel of white light or towards this tunnel of white light, with loved ones beckoning them in. Is that something of which you've got any conception or memory or experience?  <br>Christian: I only have one memory of seeing the light after a death, and there were no loved ones for me at that time in my experience. But my general comment would be, don't avoid the light. Like, why are we scaring ourselves? The light is a representation of the source of all love and beauty and joy that we are being vibrationally beckoned back towards because it's who we really are.  <br>So, it's good. I mean, our true nature is so freaking good and so free and powerful and loved and loving and joyful. I mean, eventually, we're all going to get back there. There's no way to avoid it forever. We will find our way back to the wholeness of what we are, no matter what we choose for a time. That's because that's just what we are. We can't avoid it. It's our birthright to end up back into the wholeness of the bliss and joy of being. That's just where we all will end up, one way or the other.  <br><br><br>Mark: Another thing which many will ask is why there's so much pain and suffering in this realm, and why so many bad things tend to happen to good people. Because there seems to be a direct correlation between the amount of good that you try and do and the amount of suffering that you reap as a result. And that really seems to be ramping up in these times. So, to many, this kind of reinforces the notion of a malevolent god. But it does seem as if things are unfairly skewed in this realm towards pain and suffering and hardship, rather than joy and happiness and bliss, despite, in many cases, people's best efforts. So, what's that all about?  <br>Christian: So, there's only one way this reality is skewed, and that's towards limitation. It's not skewed towards pain and misery. Fear, rejection, ego—that's pain. Now, if you go to a thought-responsive reality system and you have fear, you might create a fearful, hellish reality for a time. If you come to Earth and you have a lot of fear and rejection, you may create a pretty hellish experience for yourself too. And then, of course, the ego will blame the world because that's what ego does. That's what fear does.  <br>I don't agree with the statement that the more good we do, the more pain we experience. Actually, the more we act from love—loving intention—the more joy we experience. It's not about action. Action occurs. Intention means action. We will take action based on our intention. But it's not specific to action. It's specific to our intention.  <br>Are we choosing freedom? Are we choosing love? Are we choosing compassion to the person next to us? Are we choosing kindness? Or are we choosing rejection, self-service, running away? The universe hears exactly what our actual intention is. Like, one of the essays in my book is called You Can't Trick Your Intent. What I mean is, you can tell yourself on the mental layer anything you want. Your actual reason for why you're doing what you're doing is what will yield either bliss or misery, in general.  <br>I mean, there's certainly physical pain that will happen no matter what in the earthly experience. But I'm identifying that the physical pain is a very small portion of the negative that we experience here. The vast majority of our negative is suffering, which is our association with negative self-perceptions, the negative meaning we put on the world.  <br>Like, two people could see the same circumstance and see something very different, experience it very differently, maybe even react differently, maybe wield different intentions. And maybe the one who acts in love still experiences the bliss and love and peace of being, even in a difficult circumstance.  <br>See, consciousness is always first. As soon as we lose ourselves in the idea that there's this all-powerful external world, we have already misunderstood because that's not how it works. Consciousness is first. The world can't exist without consciousness.  <br><br><br>Mark: Yeah, I mean, I was just going by the experiences of many people that I know who I would describe as good people with good intentions. They're trying to stand in right action and trying to bring something beneficial for others and for creation itself, and they just seem to be reaping a whole load of suffering and hardship in their personal circumstances as a result. And the more good they try and do, the tougher things seem to get for them. So, that's where that question was coming from.  <br>I've got another one for you, which I'm not sure you'll be able to answer, but I'm interested in everyone's viewpoint on this. And this is, why is the natural world so brutal and horrifying in terms of the food chain in the animal kingdom? So, you know, you have creatures who are dependent on murdering other creatures every single day to the tune of several billion, just in order to survive. And if there really were a benevolent, loving God, couldn't it have designed a realm without this amount of suffering, pain, and death being necessary every day?  <br>Christian: Yeah, so to your last comment, it's not like there's a great judge sitting down at the table, rolling up their sleeves, and rubbing their hands together, saying, "Let's come up with something really horrifying here." That's not it. It's more, how much limitation can we engage and still shine and grow through it?  <br>Now, the limitations of the physical mean that, on our world at least—and this is not always the case—actually, I know this sounds crazy, but in our universe, it's actually not even always the case that animals need to eat each other's bodies to sustain physical energy. But that's how it works on Earth, and probably on other systems in the universe too, that there's a transference of physical energy from one body to the next. That's a part of the limitation set.  <br>Even that is to start neutral. So, like, as an example, we say, "Okay, but that's horrifying for the zebra, right? The zebra gets eaten by the lion." In the Seth books, Seth talks about how, on the psychic level, on the consciousness level, there is actually a loving relationship between even the zebra and the lion. And the zebra knows, in some way, it even gives itself, you could say, so that the lion may continue its existence another day.  <br>You see, it's an act of love. How can we—the ego does not like that, right? We only see pain and suffering and death. But when we accept even the great limitations, and even a system where energy seems to constantly deplete physically, you know, and we have this predatory environment that our species has grown up in over thousands and thousands of years—I mean, you're right to point out that very much that, man, we've evolved in a predatory world. We have so many "us versus them" systems that have arisen because, in part, this is a predatory world, and we've normalized predation.  <br>Well, guess what? Predation is not native to the spirit. In the sense, it's not serving of the other. It's not the ultimate. It's not the optimum way. So, the question is, now we, as spirit, what do we do now?  <br>I'm reminded of a documentary I watched about breatharianism, where they did some medical examinations of some gentlemen who basically don't eat at all—eat or drink. I guess there's a few thousand of them in the world. They did studies of at least a couple of them where they confirmed these people do not eat a single thing or drink a single thing for like weeks, and they're fine. They apparently don't eat for years at a time.  <br>I couldn't do that, but I'm just saying that the limitations can be surpassed because consciousness is deeper than the limitations. So, again, it's what does consciousness do with the context? Like, even how do we eat? How do we give thanks for or how do we honor even that passing of physical energy? Like, what do we do with it? It's the what and the why and the how. It's not automatically charged.  <br>Even death—oh, we do not like death, man. We don't like dead bodies. We don't like it when our loved ones die. They don't die. It's an illusion. It's not even real. So, you know what I mean? It's hard to see that clearly when we're really, again, like I said in the beginning, when we're form-associated, when we associate into the form and we lose ourselves in the scary story, that's already the mistake. It's not even fundamentally real. It's like a huge, rich virtual illusion that we've then had the opportunity to lose ourselves in. And that illusion includes a context of predation.  <br>Mark: Even yeah, I mean, we just hear that our natural state is that of love and goodness. That's where we come from, and that's the true nature of God, quote-unquote. But I just can't see why it would have been necessary to design a realm where that daily bloodbath is a necessity. It just seems like it would have been quite simple to have designed an alternative where that kind of experience just would not be necessary for all those creatures that undergo it every day.  <br>Christian: So, it's not necessary to design a system of this high constraint any more than it's necessary for someone to go to Mount Everest and climb Mount Everest. Now, metaphorically, you're on Mount Everest right now, and it's really cold. And why on Earth would we have Mount Everest, you proclaim?  <br>I mean, I'm not saying it's not cold, and I'm not saying there's no air up here. I get it. It's crazy. But the thing is, that's not why we go to Mount Everest. We don't go because we want to create cruelty. We go because we want to climb the mountain, and we want to be more, and we want to come down off the mountain because we know our higher natures. We know that we aren't just a world of eating and a world of pain. We aren't. We know that we're more. So, we know that we can take from that experience something that lasts—a new perspective, a new quality, a new creativity, a new way of being.  <br>You know, we don't judge somebody for climbing halfway up Mount Everest and saying they fail. No one here fails either, even if they die in one day or less before they're even born. That's not how it works. It's not a failure.  <br>So, it's just important for us to recognize that because, again, it's precisely losing ourselves in the illusion—the identification with the thing that we're not—that hurts. Like, Everest is a gift. Everest is not meant to be cruel. And yeah, only like a—I don't know what percentage climb Mount Everest—probably a 10,000th of a percent or less. Like, a millionth of a percent or something of the human race. A very small percentage of souls will come all the way down into this great experience of limitation to experience this much separation, this much darkness.  <br>This is extreme sports we're doing here. And now that we're here, we're ticked because it's too extreme, right? But we signed up for it because, basically, unconditional love is so loving, it will even let us choose this if we wish. It's always with us. We can't actually fail. It's with us throughout the entire journey. We may, and you know what, it even understands that we're upset, that we're raging against the machine. It even understands that.  <br>But here, this opportunity has been given to us, and it's up to us to decide what to do with it.  <br><br><br>Mark: Right. Various teachers and scholars will tell us it's necessary to attain some kind of enlightenment or spiritual advancement in order to transcend physicality. Or they'll say, if you don't meditate enough or develop this practice or whatever, you're never going to earn your way out of here. But your message is that you can check out anytime you like. It's a voluntary procedure.  <br>Christian: So, it is a voluntary procedure at the deepest level. But what happens at a practical level is that the given personality might seem to get stuck in orbit for a time because it gets very form-associated. So, what I mean is, you go around the Earth once in this orbit—metaphorically, it's one lifetime—and the form density in your association with it has pulled you in because you haven't fully integrated it all the way. And you go around again real quick.  <br>And that's why some people may seem, at the personality level of the self, to not have a choice about returning. There's always a choice at the soul level—always, always, always. But at the personality level, where there is still something—still some horse we want to ride, still some itch we need to scratch—until we realize we don't need to scratch any more itches, we don't actually need to ride any more horses. It's actually cold on Mount Everest. I think I'll go back down now.  <br>Until we reach really, really know that experientially, we might continue to choose to come back.  <br>Mark: I don't know if that speaks to your comment.  <br>Christian: Sure.  <br><br><br>Mark: Yeah, I've heard people who have had near-death experiences say that they didn't even realize that they died. They've said things like, in that Dannion Brinkley example, you know, he's floating above his body, looking at this meat suit on a stretcher in the hospital, thinking, "Well, what's going on here?" Because it's seamless. You're just going from one form of consciousness to another. So, you could be on your deathbed, and your family sees you slip away, and then they just see a dead body on the deathbed. But you yourself, as the spirit concerned, have just moved on to whatever lies beyond. So, it's like a seamless process. There's no such thing as death in that regard.  <br>Christian: Absolutely. Yeah, it's very seamless. I once had an out-of-body experience where I was walking down the steps in my house, and I thought I was awake. It was so normal. It was so lucid. It was just completely normal, like a completely normal morning. And then, I was getting towards the bottom of the stairs, and I noticed the quality of the light was blue-gray, a little bit, in a way that it's not normally.  <br>And I asked myself, "Am I out of body?" So, I started feeling the carpet underneath my toes. Yes, I had toes. I started feeling the crack in the wall next to my hand. I got to the bottom of the stairs, and I concluded incorrectly that I was not out of body. And then, I felt stupid for questioning whether I was out of body. But then again, it still was just a little bit off. So, I said, "All right, what the heck? If I'm out of body, I'll be able to walk through my front wall."  <br>So, I walked through the front wall of my house, and I was in my front lawn. I could see the sun rising, and I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm out of body." And I suddenly was in my bed. Now, it wasn't like waking up in my bed was more real. It was the same level of realness in the front lawn with that astral body as it was in my bed. It was very seamless. I couldn't even tell the difference.  <br>So, like you describe, many people who die, they don't even realize they've died, right? Because it's such a seamless transition. They just are suddenly looking down at this body and thinking, "That can't be me because I'm standing right here." We're not used to being the body over here and I'm over here. We're not used to two things. We're used to one—I'm in the body.  <br>Mark: Right. I've also heard people that have been in a lot of physical pain, and then they pass over, and suddenly the pain's gone, and they don't realize they've died. But they're like, "Wait, where's the pain gone? I'm not in pain anymore."  <br>Christian: Exactly. Yeah, exactly.  <br><br><br>Mark: So, have you got any conception of where you might be going next? This life is complete?  <br>Christian: No, I wouldn't dare to try to understand from this level of perception. I'm just interested in fully experiencing this human condition all that I can. I know that I'll have a much better vantage point then. So, I don't like—there's no reason for me to worry because that's not like—if I can meet this experience, this is the hard thing. Being human is the hard thing, man.  <br>If I can fully be here and accept this, that's mastery. Like, what else is there that can challenge you then, if you can fully accept being here? You see, so this is the opportunity.  <br>Mark: All right, then, Christian. Well, we'll start to wrap up there. Is there a parting message that you'd like to leave listeners with, just in summing up?  <br>Christian: Yeah, no. So, I would just say, no one's probably ever thanked you for being human before, but thank you for being human today. And also, please be reminded, there's nothing to be afraid of. There's actually no real reason to fear. Fear only arises out of the negative self-perceptions that we think the world is proving to us have to be real.  <br>Actually, we are multi-dimensional beings of love, and there's nothing to fear. And that's true even today, if you're listening to this on a Tuesday or a Saturday. It doesn't matter what day it is. You are a multi-dimensional being of love, and you can make decisions today—choices that are of love and freedom and joy. Like, you can dare even to do that. And even a small choice in that direction here on Earth is so powerful. It's so important that we do that.  <br>So, that would be my closing message.  <br>Mark: Okay, cool. Well, I'm really glad we had the conversation today. I think it's very worthwhile. So, you've got your book, A Walk in the Physical. Are there any other books out there of yours? Are there any podcasts or interviews or lectures or anything of that nature that you'd like to tell the listeners about?  <br>Christian: Yeah, thanks. My website is awalkinthephysical.com. There are many talks and interviews listed on that website, and you can copy the book online. Also, there's links to the print, ebook, or audiobook for the book. I'm just happy to share with everybody. You know, I'm passionate about us reminding each other of who we are. That's it. It's all about that. So, yeah, I hope that can be helpful to someone. And reach out with any questions.  <br>Mark: Sure. And you've been pretty busy as well. I think you do a whole ton of interviews because I reached out to you quite a few months ago to get this date in the diary, and it's kind of like that for me because I talk about the shenanigans of the music industry, and I get a lot of requests to do interviews and podcasts and stuff. And you know, I'm booking sort of six to eight months ahead. So, you're pretty busy with all this stuff, right?  <br>Christian: Yeah, no, that's true. I definitely have probably 50 requests right now, but I just try to stagger it as possible to respect my own bandwidth and try to follow the spirit. And you know, I don't give precedence to channel size or who somebody is. I'm really passionate about sharing this because this is what we really are. And if one person can feel more light and more empowered, then that's awesome. That's all I want because, when this is all over and we look back, the love is what matters.  <br>You know, I'm happy. I mean, I have my own stamina issues. I work full-time at a challenging job. I have kids. I'm engaged in some community activities. And I also get a lot of emails, and I do one-on-ones with people on the spiritual content. So, I am very busy, but it's my passion. It's my love. You know, if you do what you love, that energy just arises. It comes from somewhere.  <br>Mark: Yeah, it's important we do that. Well, that's how I view this conversation today. It would have been a wasted opportunity to get to the end of my life and not have had this chat. So, we've done it now. So, appreciate you coming on today. Thanks for that.  <br>Christian: Thank you so much, Mark. I appreciate the opportunity. Have a great day being human today.  <br>Mark: I'm picking up vibration. I'm picking up vibration. I'm picking up vibration.  ]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2024/good-vibrations-podcast-vol-247-christian-sundberg-life-between-lives.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2024/GOOD VIBRATIONS PODCAST VOL 247 CHRISTIAN SUNDBERG - LIFE BETWEEN LIVES.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:06:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[HE REMEMBERS BEING WITH GOD AND SAYS, “GOD IS UNSPEAKABLY LOVING” – Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUYLj9XJaak" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUYLj9XJaak</a>  <br>22 SEP 2024<br><br><br>Okay, awesome. All right, so we’ll jump into the Q&amp;A now. I think we’re really good here because I usually have 40 questions—I’m not joking—and I only see like maybe 15. Okay, we’ll see. We’ll be good with time. But I want to first say that you were referred to me. Somebody was looking at Aaron Green’s interview with me because, obviously, pre-birth stuff. And they said, “Please do a Q&amp;A with Christian Sundberg.” So I want to say a big shout-out to Archaic St3 for making this happen.  <br>I also want to say to people, because my channel is so small, when people like you—who are basically like a celebrity in regards to this world, the spiritual world—when you say yes to me, I know that you’re the real deal. So I just want to thank you so much for taking time out to have this discussion so I can fully understand.  <br>So, you had these memories up until the age of five, which is pretty—not to say normal, but I just did a whole thing with pre-birth, and yes, up until about four or five, before you start going to school and getting acclimated, we tend to hold on to these memories. But they diminished, and then you started meditation and were able to recollect all of this information. Is that correct?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yes, yeah, that’s true. But I’m careful with the word usage though. I wouldn’t say that I meditated and therefore I was able to recollect it. It’s more like, as I meditated—meditation is just a word for the deep investigation of what you really are, what consciousness really is beneath all thought—so it was more like I gained more and more familiarity with what I really am. And then, once I knew experientially and was in touch with what I really am, the pre-birth memories were just there. They were so normal. In fact, the human thing, the human experience, is like the strange thing, you know?  <br><br><br>Interviewer: Okay, and did they come all at once or just gradually?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Basically all at once. I’ve had other pieces open up here and there, but it was basically all just there at once, and it was very normal. I just started talking about it to a few people, but it didn’t seem strange to me. It was just like, “Oh yeah, that’s who I am. That’s cool.” And then I mentioned it a couple of times, and someone said, “That’s extraordinary.” And I said, “It didn’t even occur to me.” I was like, “Oh, I guess it is from the human point of view.” But it was very normal. It would just be like someone saying the sky is blue. It’s like, “Okay, I know.”  <br>Interviewer: Awesome, awesome. And before we get into the meaty questions, what type of meditation were you doing? I’m sure people want to know.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so we tend to get hung up on categorizing. I guess the closest term would be Transcendental Meditation. That’s probably the closest term. But I feel like we want activity, we want process, we want form. So, which form did you do? Really, it’s a consistent investigation of your consciousness of self beneath all thought and all emotion. And that starts as being able to choose something to focus on. So that’s why Transcendental Meditation can be important—picking a mantra or a shape or something in your mind and just focusing on only that, putting all your attention on it.  <br>You’ll find that thoughts come right away. When you haven’t practiced meditation, you don’t have control over what you’re thinking because you’re just thinking about lunch, and now you’re thinking about work, and you’re thinking about this person who insulted you or something. The thoughts just keep coming. But if you practice choosing your focus, without knowing it, you’re actually slowing the thought momentum. You’re reclaiming conscious control and awareness. It’s like becoming awake, actually.  <br>And then, eventually, not too soon, you can drop the form of focus—whether it’s a mantra or a shape or whatever—and just focus on awareness itself. Your awareness itself. Don’t make up anything. Just deeply look there and feel it and know it in a non-thinking but deeply full, active, present way.  <br>So, I don’t know what word you put on that. I do recommend a meditation exercise in my book that’s very similar to the one recommended by Tom Campbell, who is the consciousness explorer whose work kind of started me down this path. He recommended a meditation exercise, and that’s kind of what started me down the path.  <br>But I highly recommend it because it’s one thing to think about spirituality and to read the books. It’s okay to do that, but there’s nothing like actually discovering, even in a tiny way, who you really are. It’s such a deep well and has such a reward to it. So, I highly recommend it as a form of investigation, actually, not just as a practice.  <br>Interviewer: I like that. And there’s a similar form of meditation that’s mentioned in the Ra Material, the Law of One, just FYI for people. So, I think there clearly is something to having that mantra or that focused image that you pay attention to. So, I think there is something there.  <br>All right, so you had all these remembrances, and maybe say downloads to some extent. Have you experienced other realms and dimensions?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, I know it sounds really strange to say that because as soon as you say that, it’s like, “Oh wow, that’s looney bin stuff.” But strange to me, just FYI.  <br>So, I have, and it’s very normal now. Out-of-body experiences can be at least as real as fully lucid human earthly waking life, which is pretty darn real. And even far more real. It’s not like a shady dream or something. When you’re in those environments, the realness, the lucidity, the veracity of it is completely self-evident.  <br>So, I’ve experienced other realms, and they are very real. And afterwards, when you kind of come back, so to speak, to Earth, this is like a black-and-white movie by comparison. So, then people are like, “Oh, is that real? Is this real?” Man, this is like the more dead state, actually. We talk about dead people being off, and this is alive, but this is actually the more dead state in the sense that the amount of limitation that we experience while human is huge.  <br>So, this is the much more limited state of being, and our spirit naturally engages systems with much less limitation and therefore knows much more of itself. And yes, that’s real.  <br>Interviewer: Okay, and did you get to these states through meditation as well, or something different?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, I mean, once again, it’s okay to say through meditation if we’re thinking of action leads to result. But I don’t like drawing a parallel because the thing is, the human wants to think, “Do A to get B,” like go from point A to B by doing something. That local causality type action is not really what we’re talking about. We’re actually talking about a move towards consciousness itself, which transcends the local.  <br>And in that, yes, the soul engages many reality systems naturally. So, I’m putting it that way only because I’m hesitant about saying, “Do this thing, and then you get to leave your body.” Well, your body is just an experience occurring within you. So, deeply explore yourself, and then you may find spontaneously—or even in small amounts at first—that you are already engaged outside of the veil right now.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: Yeah, so I asked that question, and I guess it’s good that we reiterate that because some people are actually using processes, whether it be binaural beats, and that’s okay.  <br>Christian Sundberg: And I don’t mean to say that we shouldn’t use processes. I’m only very sensitive to the language because there’s already a built-in misassumption when we think, “Oh, I need to do this action and get this result.” I’m just trying to lift that up because the shift in consciousness, the shift in your mind, actually, of just knowing that this is very close to you—this is not far, it’s not hard to get, you don’t actually have to do the thing—it’s actually more like look away from this thing.  <br>And so, I’m lifting that up because then that is the way you see it. It’s like if you’re watching a movie in the movie theater, you don’t really do something in the movie. You instead return to seeing that, “Oh, you’re sitting in the seat. You weren’t actually in the movie. Oh, it’s just a movie. Oh, I see.” And then once you’re in the seat, then you have much freedom that’s just naturally available to you.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. Okay, and do you think this is something that most people who are in this Earth game or play or whatever you call this experience—do you feel like most, if not all, people should be working on understanding what’s outside of this experience? Or is the whole purpose to experience and to just be in it? Or is it dependent on the person?  <br>Christian Sundberg: I can’t—yeah, it’s dependent because I can’t—there’s no categorical answer in the sense that each soul is unique, and their journey is unique. And I think both are important. So, I’ll start with the second one first because we’re here to be human. Like, we’re here to be veiled. We’re here to go eat our food and go to the store and pay the bills and put on clothes and stuff. You know, that’s like what we do. That’s what we’re here to experience, and that’s good.  <br>In fact, I’ll just make a comment here really quickly that this whole pursuit of spirituality is not about going and getting something else that’s not here. It’s actually about accepting what’s here so deeply and accepting yourself so deeply—which is very alert, non-rejecting—that you widen yourself to even more.  <br>In fact, there’s a TikToker named Yesui who I think is quite amazing, and she said something like, “You don’t leave this bandwidth and go to that bandwidth, the spiritual. No, rather, you accept all bandwidths.” And as you do that, the amount of bandwidths you get increases.  <br>So, I think that’s important to say because these two things are not contradictory. We can be fully present and fully experience the human experience, and yet, to your first one, it is valuable indeed for sure to investigate your consciousness itself.  <br>And I’ll just say one thing like why that’s so valuable. Yes, we’re here to be human, but here’s the thing: our true nature is love and peace and joy and freedom. And that’s good. That’s really good. So, it’s a bit like asking, “Can we benefit from more peace and love and joy and freedom?” Yes, we can.  <br>And meditation is simply the word we use to describe getting back in touch with that native love and peace and joy and freedom. So, yeah, that’s very powerful. It’s very freeing and empowering.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: And that ties to two different questions. So, from your vantage point of what you’ve learned of reality, do you believe that we have higher aspects? Like, is there maybe the oversoul, and then there are different levels of us? Some of us are just extremely advanced but at higher levels, but at the same time, we’re here in this low realm. So, do you feel like we are just this individual soul or spirit in this space, or do we have this multi-dimensional aspect where we have higher levels of ourselves?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so we do have—okay, we call it an oversoul. Let’s just call that your higher self for simple terms. So, yeah, we have a higher self. But the higher self is not some other being. It’s you. This is really important because then we tend to think, “Oh, well, I’m just this upset human here who’s got bills to pay, and I just have a headache. I’m not the soul. Can’t my soul see I’m pissed?”  <br>But the thing is, you are your soul. You are your soul seeing out the eyes of this thing that we’re doing here, this human thing, and seeing through the limitations. And yes, that soul, that higher you, has much more to it than just your human character. It just means that you have done and are doing other things too. But it’s you. It’s still you.  <br>So, yes, the human character is just one small piece of the much larger multi-dimensional whole. Absolutely. But I also think it’s important not to divorce the human personality, which feels separate—of course, I know it feels separate—but I think it’s important not to divorce that separate-feeling human personality from the whole. It’s still the you that feels like you to you.  <br>And that’s one of the things that’s so empowering about meditation. When you investigate the real you, you’re not making up anything. You’re going and seeing, “Who am I?” And as you do that, that’s a very deep well, and there is a lot there that you may not see at first because of how deeply we are veiled here. And that’s okay. It’s not multiple things. It’s just all one you.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: Like, I don’t have a lot of questions, but I want to ask you five questions at once. It’s very difficult right now for me. I understand that.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Oh my God.  <br>Interviewer: So, hopefully, I don’t forget any of these. But okay, just jumping into something that’s been—because I realized that nothing is by coincidence—so I’ve been talking on some of the NDE forums, and I came upon somebody who had a very intricate NDE, and their downloads are off the charts with what they understand about reality. But they feel very much so that they should not be sharing this information with others. Like, they really just feel like it’s for their own growth, and it’s kind of like, “I’ll stay in my lane, and good luck to the rest of you.”  <br>And I think they use the analogy of like a monkey pulling a fish out of the water so that it can breathe, and ultimately, the fish will die because it can’t breathe air. But on the other hand, you have the Bodhisattva Vow, where somebody who is enlightened decides to go back and help others to become enlightened.  <br>And I’ve heard you in previous interviews mention that—well, not even well, in this one, you mentioned that we are in an awakening cycle. Yes. And I’m assuming that you mean like the Kali Yuga, like we went—I don’t know if that’s a big assumption, so you could let me know if that’s—I don’t know what you mean by Kali Yuga.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Sorry, okay, so this is gonna have to be another question.  <br>Interviewer: Okay, but you’re saying we’re in a waking cycle, and clearly, by you being in all these interviews, it shows that you’re trying to share and to uplift, right? So, do you—and I guess it’s kind of tied to the previous questions—do you feel as if there is the need for a greater awakening for more people to either hear these—not to push it on them and kind of just say, “Here, take this or die”—we’re not doing the whole Crusades or that kind of thing—but just trying to uplift the all? Like, what do you think in regards to either keeping information for yourself, worrying about your own enlightenment, or helping the collective of Earth?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yes, that’s a really good question and something that I have personally navigated very carefully over the last six years because there are definitely times when it’s not appropriate to share for whatever reason. And I tend to be very—I try to be very true to how I’m intuitively led. Like, there are some aspects of my experience I’ve been nudged not to share, so I just don’t share it. It’s okay.  <br>However, I like the metaphor of the monkey pulling the fish out of water. It’s not helpful for the fish. It’s not helpful for some people to turn over their worldview and dump it upside down. They are a loving brother and sister. Why would we need to do that to them?  <br>So, I acknowledge that. But meanwhile, however, our true nature is love and peace and freedom and joy, and that is what we’re moving towards. And Earth has a long history of fear, which is, you know, painful. It’s an ego. So, the ego rises out of fear, and we have enshrined egoic process in our institutions for thousands of years.  <br>And fear hurts. Fear is insane. Let’s just put it that way. Whether it’s small fear or large fear, it’s insane, partly because it’s based in a perception that’s not even fundamentally true. It’s always based in some negative perception like, “I’m powerless,” or “I’m not worthy of love,” or “There’s something.” And those are not true.  <br>So, fear is based in something untrue. It has no true foundation. It has no foundation. But here we are, for thousands of years, running around fear-driven. Which, by the way, just as a tangent—I’m getting down another tangent here—but like, the main thing we’re here to do is to evolve the quality of our intention choice-making towards love, real love, and past fear.  <br><br><br>See, because the fear is not even real. So, to your question, is it beneficial to—let’s call it—intelligently, carefully help others to see where fear is not necessary and to empower them? Because that’s what this is about. And I would say yes. I feel that it is important that we remind each other of who we really are because there is so much power in that.  <br>Now, I know that it can stimulate fear. In fact, right now, we are going through this awakening process, and it’s high friction because fear wants to hold on. Ego wants to hold on to the beliefs. That’s what ego does. “Don’t threaten my beliefs. I believe that. Nope, you go away, or I’m gonna bonk you over the head.” You know, that’s how ego thinks.  <br>And right now, there’s a lot of new ideas flooding the collective consciousness, and for some, ideas like this are not helpful. What comes to mind for me is a very personal story, actually. The short version is that when I went through my awakening at the age of 30, and over the next eight years, it was very personal. I didn’t share it, but I began to feel called to share it. I began to write the book, and I knew that I needed to share eventually.  <br>And like I said, at age 38, I did share. But at the time, my wife’s parents—even now—are not of the same mindset, and I respect their religious beliefs. However, they have—I have unintentionally caused them, in quotes, a huge amount of discomfort and pain because they believe that by my sharing this message, I am threatening the souls of my children. You know, because they don’t believe—you know, the way they believe in Jesus Christ—and they think, “There must be demons involved. There must be demons involved.” You know, always, that’s the thing.  <br>But the thing is, I had to make a decision. Like, am I gonna let—because it’s not me causing it, actually. And I know that it’s actually more that I am simply presenting something that catalyzes friction. It stimulates opposition, unapparent opposition. But it helps others.  <br>So, I had to make this decision, and in fact, when I made the decision, I had no thought about the number of people or anything like that. I only felt the quality of intention. I felt spirit, and I felt the nudge like, “This is a message of love. This is a message of love.”  <br>And when you experience this and you feel our multi-dimensional nature of love, you just want to grab everybody by the shoulders and say, “We are multi-dimensional beings of love, and you have nothing to fear. Like, nothing. Nothing to fear.” I wanted to shout that from the rooftops.  <br>And so, finally, when I made the decision to share, I thought, “Okay, maybe five people will hear this, and that would have been enough.” That would have been enough because it was about the quality of intention, the desire to actually help. And I deeply feel that I feel called in my bones to share the message of love and freedom and to give power back to others.  <br>Because the thing is, right now, we all think all this power is out in our systems—our governments, our society, our beliefs, or religious institutions, or governmental institutions, or companies, or money, or whatever. Okay, guys, like, the power is yours. And you have nothing to fear. Like, that’s what I want to share. That is the most important message.  <br>This has nothing to do with me. It has everything to do with who we all really are and what our true nature of love really is. And so, to your question, all the way back around in a big circle, yes, I feel that’s valuable to do, even as I acknowledge the importance of discernment with how we do it because I know that it affects certain people in ways that are not helpful.  <br>And if someone’s not ready, that’s okay. That’s totally fine. Like, I don’t have an agenda. I’m not selling anything. And love does not require the other person to change. You see, love does not bonk them over the head. It doesn’t need to make the fish breathe air. It loves the fish.  <br>And the thing is, though, if we love the fish, the fish is made of love too. So, what happens is the other tends to feel it, whether they can consciously identify it or not. And they might rise up out of the water a little bit on their own. They might grow little legs, you know, turn into one of those little cute little mud creek guys—mudskippers or whatever—because love calls us.  <br>We’re all called by that freedom and that love, whether we consciously identify it or not. And it’s okay that we are deeply wrapped into form here, into thoughts and beliefs and identities. That’s the name of the game. It’s okay. It’s okay if it’s not received when there’s some form association. That’s fine.  <br>But meanwhile, I do feel that it’s very valuable to share. 100%. And like I said, you’re helping me even now because I’m in that zone. Like, I go back and forth, and I’m definitely right now where I’m like, “I went off this planet. I’m done with this game.” It’s okay. I’m running out here. A lot of us feel that way.  <br>It’s ironic because pre-life, we see what an absolutely incredible opportunity this is. And to put it in Earthly metaphor, it’s like there’s a huge line to get in here. A huge line. There are only a very small number of slots, and you say, “Oh, there’s billions of us.” That’s a very small number compared to the size of the multiverse and all the souls that exist.  <br>And to be given the chance to play a human life is like winning the freaking lottery. I’m not kidding. You feel like all that chose you out of everybody, and that you are given the honor to go down into the deep muck and to actually be and love and shine and be your authentic self. And to grow. You’re given the opportunity to grow in incredible ways.  <br>I can’t stress this enough. The value of the human experience is so huge. So, it’s ironic that so many of us that are here, especially the more sensitive among us, we just want to get out sometimes because, look, this is kind of a mess.  <br>Well, it’s okay that you feel that way. Where is your resistance? Where are you saying no to this limitation set where you’re not being yourself, which is joy and love and peace? And it’s okay if you choose more of that joy and love and peace.  <br>“Oh, but I have good reasons. I can’t.” Okay, do you really? Like, you know, we can look at our reasons and the things that we think are such good reasons to not be ourselves. Like, I’m saying, if we align with who we really are and we be ourselves, life is no longer this horror show anymore because it doesn’t even really super matter what’s happening outside in the sense that you are yourself anyway, and you’re shining with joy and freedom anyway.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. So, it can be done. I’m not making light of the feeling, though.  <br>Christian Sundberg: No, no. And I mean, I’ve heard this. I do a lot of research, a lot of reading on NDEs and all these different experiences people have, and you are not the first one to say that Earth is like—you know, like people in line to try to get on this hell planet. And it’s just—it’s like you said, it’s—I wouldn’t call it a hell planet. Let’s call it a highly limiting simulation.  <br>It’s actually not—oh, I like the look on your face. But so, because it’s not actually charged—let me just comment on this because the thing that makes it a hell planet—there’s only one thing that makes it a hell planet: fear. Is the planet’s fear or is it ours?  <br>Well, it’s not the planet. It’s not the context. It’s ours. It’s our—to put it in a more direct way, it’s our unevolvedness that makes this hell. Not the planet.  <br>Interviewer: Okay, explain to me.  <br>Christian Sundberg: All right, so you say that we are all love, like on the other side, complete love. And it’s good that I’m asking these questions because people are gonna be thinking, “Where does all the fear, the darkness, the evil come from? Where does it all come from?”  <br>It’s not a separate thing. It’s not a fundamental thing. The fundamental thing is love and peace and joy. If you look at consciousness deeply, you find that it’s made of love and peace and joy and freedom. And consciousness, spirit, is the fundamental substrate.  <br>I’m gonna pause there because that’s super important. Okay, then something happens. Consciousness falls asleep into something else that it’s not. So, we come here to be something that we’re not, which is what the veil permits. And it permits a set of limitations to be imposed upon consciousness such that consciousness has the potential to buy into a perception that isn’t true. And that causes fear.  <br>And fear gives rise to all the thousands of manifestations of ego, darkness. So, fear is just a simple word, but what I mean by fear is that part of us that is unevolved, that rejects, that says no. Just like I did a few seconds into my life before I even had—nobody taught me anything. I was in the womb. I didn’t know anything. I just felt, and a perception rose up: “I am not the whole anymore. I have no power.” And fear rose immediately in that.  <br>But that perception wasn’t true. You see, in my second experience, it was what God showed me—that that was not true. It was like a deep illusion that I was entertaining. So, where does it come from? It comes from being something we’re not and buying into that.  <br>And then, once we buy into it, now the small self is desperate to fix this huge problem. Now we have this huge problem. Now we’re separate from each other. We’re separate from the whole. We’re not loved. We’re not free. Now there’s a huge problem.  <br>And so, what happens? The ego rises up. That’s just a part of us that says, “I’ll fix the problem here. You’re powerless here. Now you have power. Look, because you can—I don’t know—hurt the person next to you. Don’t you feel better now? Because look, now you have this proof that you can hurt this person next to you, so that means you have power.”  <br>Or, “You don’t have value, but hey, look, now you have money in your bank account. Doesn’t that make you feel—see, now you have value.” Or, “You’re afraid that you don’t know that you’re going to actually exist past the end of physical death, so here—oh, here’s a religious belief. Now, if you believe this, you’re taken care of. Don’t you feel better now that you believe that?”  <br>See, that’s what we do inside instantly, so quick. This is not a slow, necessarily slow process. Very quick, as the ego portion of us rises up and tries to grab onto something made out of straw to cover up that fear.  <br>But what we’re here to do then is to see through that, work through that experientially, and to discover there actually was nothing to be afraid of. And our true nature remained what it is, except now we’ve known that, and we’ve experienced the opposite of what we are. And through that, we’ve expanded that far.  <br>We’ve—you could say that duality carves out the cave so that there’s space for us to grow into. But the true nature, the true substance, can’t be anything else. Another metaphor might be, you know, water is always water, even if you freeze it down into an ice cube. You lower its vibration, you lower its temperature, now it’s changed form. Now it’s become dense. It’s crystallized.  <br>That’s what consciousness does here. We crystallize down into this thing. And then you say, “Well, how is there something other than water?” Well, there actually isn’t. It’s just that its temperature changed, its vibration shifted. That’s all. It’s still water. And we are still water. We’re like ice cubes within the larger ocean. We didn’t actually go anywhere anyway.  <br>So, I hope that kind of speaks to your question, like, where did it come from? Because it’s not like a sub—here in duality, we like to think there’s hot and there’s cold, there’s light and there’s dark. Light and dark is not a terrible metaphor because darkness is not a thing. Darkness is just where there’s no light. Similarly, fear is not really a thing. It’s just when we’ve looked away from love towards a perception that’s not true.  <br>And then, that is part of the game. That this illusion or this challenge or catalyst is part of the game. It’s written into this Earth. The limitation is written into the game. The fear is not the—well, but it’s seen that the fear could happen for sure.  <br><br><br>I mean, okay, I’m saying that it’s not like we come to be afraid. We come to face the limitation and see if we can not be afraid. See if we can know our true selves and choose the loving choice even in the great limitation. That’s what we’re here to do.  <br>Because the fear is not a real thing. It’s kind of like if you—let’s say you go into an amusement park. There’s this amusement park near my house that has like one of those walk-through scary houses where there’s dark tunnels. Yeah, I haven’t done it in a long time. When I was a kid, I loved it. You walk through these little tunnels, and there’s little thingies grabbing you, and there’s lights, and there’s angled rooms, and you know, and when you’re seeing it, you feel fear.  <br>And it’s actually exciting because you know it can’t actually hurt you. But in this reality, you think it can hurt you because you can get stabbed, you can die. It’s pretty—it looks pretty serious. Like, the fun house, though, eventually through integration of that experience, through experience itself, through growing up—you could say, which is evolution—through growing up, now if I go back into—I went back into that house a couple of years ago with one of my kids, it was not scary.  <br>Obviously, it doesn’t need it. I don’t need to tell somebody why. If they say, “Where did the fear exit from this house? Show me where the fear exited.” There was no fear in the house. The fear was mine. You see, the house was just janky and slanted and dark and full of weird things that can touch you.  <br>Here, in this context, we’re wearing a body, and we’re in a society that is not understanding very much of what we really are, and we have a lot of “us versus them” mentality. We’ve normalized predatory economic behaviors and all these things. That’s now our context. We made it, by the way. We, the players, made it. Not some other being. With the billions of players who have played this game, this is what we’ve built.  <br>It’s just what we’ve done with it. It doesn’t have an inherent badness to it. It’s just what we built. And now that we’re here, can we see more clearly? That’s the question.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: So, again, three questions that you asked. But I do want to mention because we did mention it—so, you said the awakening process. When I mentioned the Kali Yuga, I don’t know much about it. I just hear it a lot, and it’s apparently in Hinduism. It’s the different stages or world stages. There are four different ones, and that the Kali Yuga was the horrible one, the one that was just full of fear and corruption and all that kind of stuff.  <br>And that supposedly, eventually—the date keeps changing, it depends on who you talk to—we’re going back into a positive, so it’s kind of like an up-and-down kind of cycle, and that we’re going back into the positive golden age where things get better, and we’re more awakened and conscious of who we really are.  <br>So, with that said, it kind of sounds like what you’re saying—the awakening process—that maybe that’s why we’re doing that. We’re trying to pull ourselves back into what we truly are and remember, at least.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yes, and okay, yeah. We are trying to do that because ultimately, all of this journey through the worlds of form is back to love. Like, we wouldn’t—it feels like we left love when we’re here. But in the big picture sense, it doesn’t make any sense to leave love unless you can come back.  <br>That’s a very crude way to put it, but I’m saying it that way because it is an absolutely 100% false assumption to think that we are stuck outside of love. We can’t be. It’s our true nature. So, then, the reason I’m saying it in the context of your comment is we may dive deeply into worlds of form for hundreds or thousands of years, but that is about returning.  <br>It’s about the journey of digging out that cavern so deeply that we then integrate the whole thing and return to what we are in an even bigger way. You could say it’s a little bit like saying, you know, like doing a pull-up or something. Like, well, are we pulling ourselves up? Well, yeah, that’s what you do during a pull-up exercise.  <br>You may be hanging there, and your body may be heavy, but you try to pull yourself up. Like, that’s the natural direction. That’s the natural thing to do with a pull-up. Here, the natural thing for us to do is to integrate all of this, to heal all the fear, to allow love and peace and joy and freedom to be more fully actualized here, and to return to it as what we already are, even through this place.  <br>Like, we can’t actually lose it anyway. It’s just a big simulation.  <br>Interviewer: Are we gaining in love? And because I want to bring it back to an analogy that you mentioned before in regards to weightlifting that I thought was amazing. I love that idea that we’re putting on this extra weight, which is this world, this very dense world, in order to try to—I guess lift up the love, like to show, “Okay, no, I really am love. Like, I’m proving that I’m really love,” right? To get past that challenge.  <br>But so, the question to me is, is it like the coal that becomes the diamond? Are we here to become better or more improved or more enlightened with this love light?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yes, or okay, yeah. The short version is yes. So, there are two things to this though. First is, water can’t actually be more wet. So, what I mean is, consciousness is already love and peace and joy and freedom, and it doesn’t need to do anything. There’s nothing required of you. There’s absolutely nothing required of you. You’re totally free.  <br>Okay, then, subsequent to that, out of curiosity and out of the sheer joy of who we are and out of our creative natures, we may create entire universes of form and work through them. And through doing so, expand what is possible, expand what we could know, expand what we can feel, expand what we can do, what we can be.  <br>That’s what we’re doing. That expansion is happening through this experience. Like, the being I saw on the other side, his nature was so overwhelmingly beautiful and full of freedom and power, and I was like, “I want to be that. I want to do that. That’s amazing.” That is amazing.  <br>So, when you ask that question, because it feels like when you look at a being like that in the non-physical, it feels like they were given that state of being. But it’s not that they were handed the state of being. It was that they were handed the weight. Like, you know what I mean?  <br>Like, if you saw an Olympian who’s strong—physically strong—and you say, “Who gave that to you?” Well, nobody gave it to them. What they were given was the opportunity to exercise, to lift a weight, to go running. And then, because they did that, they grew. They became stronger. And that is how it is spiritually.  <br>So, the body of the spirit, the body of awareness—you put it this way—the soul has qualities. It has capability and knowing and wisdom and abilities, I guess would be a crude word. And so, through pitting itself into something potentially challenging—oh, that’s the most tasty type of exercise possible because now you’ve challenged that thing, which is like—you could say the soul is beyond challenge, actually, in a way.  <br>So, it’s so precious to be given an actual challenge. You put it that way. Like, you’re because the soul is a part of the whole. It’s a part of God. Like, what can challenge God? Nothing. It has no opposition. It has no enemy. It has no adversity. It has no need. No need at all.  <br>So, then, how does it grow if it wants to within itself? By creating a system of duality that it integrates through. And that is what we are doing through this experience. And that’s one of the reasons why the human experience is so valuable because the limitations are so high.  <br>So, it’s like lifting a thousand pounds on the bench, and then you go to a thought-responsive reality system like the astral or something, where a thought becomes a thing instantly, and you’re able to wield certain intentionality, certain quality of being, that no one who has not been physical can wield because you’ve done the hard stuff.  <br>Maybe like throwing one pound when you used to throw a thousand. It’s not hard. It’s not hard for you because you threw the thousand pounds, you know? So, being human is like being offered a thousand pounds instead of ten. And only those of us who are very bold and very brave and very—the word “warriors” pops into my mind—we are the warriors who decide to come down here and do this.  <br>I’ve heard Suzanne Giesemann in her NDE say we’re like fighter jet pilots flying our jets 20 feet up off the ground, upside down. That’s true. It’s like that. I mean, I’ve heard where souls return from Earth, and they see an arena that’s full of people applauding them. And I always wonder, like, why are they applauding them? So, that could explain that.  <br>Interviewer: But so, this—I have three questions that came just out of that. So, one, are we growing God? Are we expanding God in some kind of way? And which sounds very blasphemous. I’m even surprised I’m saying the word, but yeah.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Well, so I think that boils—I think so. I have to say two things at once again. God can’t—so, God—we are—say, okay, the water is the ocean. When we talk about God, we’re talking about the ocean. Every soul is a drop of water in the ocean. We’re talking about the entire ocean.  <br>We are pieces of it. On one hand, water doesn’t get more wet. It’s just what it is. It’s already perfect. On the other hand, yes, as pieces of the whole, as we grow, more is expanded and added to the ocean too. So, we are participating in an expansive process that contributes to the whole. Yes.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: Okay, and in regards to regressive souls, I’ve heard this before as well. You know, talk about dark spirits or demons or people who just really let the ego bring them to the lowest of lows. And people have experienced this. I’ve felt this. I mean, thankfully, not as much as maybe others, but I know that there are dark energies out there or dark souls out there.  <br>Where’s my question here? Can I pause you real quick?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so it’s not—let’s just—I want to be careful. It’s not that souls are dark. It’s that souls may be unevolved, and they might then have a lot of fear. And a lot of fear might mean a lot of ego and a lot of hatred and a lot of anger and a lot of all that nasty, gunky stuff that we call darkness.  <br>So, the nature of the soul is always love and peace and freedom and joy. That’s true no matter what. No matter what fear, no matter what creature you meet, what being—whether physical or non-physical—that may have fear, depending on the system they’re operating in. No matter if that’s true.  <br>And by the way, the fear is commensurate with the level of limitation. So, high limitation environments like ours have high opportunity to provoke fear because there’s so much limitation, so much pain.  <br>Okay, fear is not integral to that person. It’s not native to them. It’s not native to them. But it is insane, and it can get very asleep. Ego is very asleep, and it falls into these patterns of anger and hurtfulness. But I don’t personally draw a huge distinction between small fear and big fear. It’s all insane.  <br>So, my fear—where I might feel anger at somebody if somebody does something to me—maybe if I feel a glimmer of anger, I’ve actually fallen asleep into insaneness, even though that may seem different than, like, Hitler killing millions of people. It’s still ego trying to do its best with what it’s been given out of fear.  <br>Now, we like to call that force evil. And I understand, in our duality, sometimes that’s useful to identify the light and the dark. Of course, I don’t mean to say it’s not useful. However, I think we’re doing each other and all that a disservice by inappropriately assigning fundamental realness to the evil and to the darkness. It’s not fundamental.  <br>It does happen because we have a high system of limitation and because we have a lot of fear. It happens. It rises up.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, so for the soul that fell into that and is, you know, as opposed to evolving, is devolving—do you feel like, on the other side, they are still at the same level of love? Or do you feel like it’s possible, on the other side, that they may have actually gone backwards in some ways, like the water evaporating?  <br>Christian Sundberg: No, no, no. The water can’t evaporate. But the thing is, okay, so over a certain period of time, devolution may seem to happen. We tend to be sensitive to time. So, if we see someone who is evil their whole lives, that’s a long time, right? Not really. It’s actually a pretty short jaunt. It’s a short walk in the park.  <br>So, I’m just lifting up that, always, one way or the other, this is the key: one way or another, whether it be one minute, one day, or 100 lifetimes, we all will evolve back up and find ourselves back. But even more now.  <br>Like, all processes of form cannot help but serve the expansion of love in the end. This is so, so, so important. There’s no such thing as a process within form that doesn’t ultimately serve love. It can’t. Nothing can escape the use of love in its evolution because love is the real thing. It is the truth. It has the power.  <br>Spirit has the power. Fake power—someone wielding fear and ego and, like, pulling out a gun and shooting you in the face—that may seem really terrible in the local sense, but that is very limited power by comparison to spirit.  <br>And fearful action—now, okay, okay. So, there are, in the divine wisdom of source that is so deep, systems of what we call karma in place, which facilitate the integration of the fear such that the being returns to fullness of love over time. Those laws operate inexorably because you can’t escape who you are.  <br>So, if you have acted unevolved, if you are an unevolved being, and you get thrown into a form system that turns you around, and now you’ve got all sorts of ego shenanigans going on, then that’s who you are. You’re an unevolved being. That’s okay because the system then is built—not only in a given lifetime but even beyond it—to help that being to face and process that and heal even through that.  <br>Like, when I saw the potential for this life—oh my gosh—and this fear that I wanted to integrate, like I said, I was a very damaging, egoic monster in a previous life. I hurt many people, and I died in agonizing death in that life because of the fear. But from my perspective in spirit, I can see, “Oh wow, I have deep fear in there.”  <br>But I knew that if I could process that and heal it and integrate it, I would be—oh my gosh, I cannot describe this—the amount of love expansion that could occur within me and the whole would be huge. Huge. And the opportunity was so amazing that I valued the opportunity to come back here and to suffer a trauma in my 20s.  <br>I knew it was very likely that I would suffer a health trauma in my 20s, and it would give me a chance to re-experience this fear. That did happen because I could see that that was an incredible opportunity. I knew it would be very, very challenging, but I was excited because I knew, at that point, what the soul always knows, which is that we are multi-dimensional beings.  <br>We are immortal. We have absolutely nothing to fear. We have nothing to fear. But we need to get in and get our hands dirty in order to actually process that and integrate that.  <br>Interviewer: There’s no good vocabulary for this. I love that you’re saying that because, for starters, when you think about us having—like you said, multi-dimensional—we have all these alternate lives or parallel lives happening at the same time. And I’ve heard from people that if you do the work in your current life—what you’re experiencing right now, what you think to be your current life—that it can domino effect into the others and help the whole.  <br><br><br>And I like that you’re saying even bigger that what you might take on in this life and surpass—and you know, like pass that level—you’re helping the all. Like, helping everybody.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yes, you are. Yes, you are absolutely. And I want to make it even more—you’re absolutely correct. And I want to make it even more specific. When you process your crap for real—I’m not talking like for pretend, I’m talking like for real—when you really get in there and own your crap and feel your feelings and own yourself and be authentic and own who you are and heal, you are helping the entire collective consciousness of humanity to heal.  <br>Because you are a part of that pond. Call the collective consciousness a pond within the ocean. When you shift—you’re not trying to shift, actually. When you do this, you’re just trying to move more towards love and process fear. Right? You’re trying to be more yourself.  <br>When you really, really do that for real—and whatever that means for you, it could be a very small thing—it’s not about size. All of size is simulated anyway. What’s important is consciousness and the quality of intention it’s wielding.  <br>So, if in the quiet of your bedroom, you face your fear, you are helping the entire Earth to heal. That is a very, very powerful and important message. Like, it actually—because you could think of it like a bunch of candles in a room, maybe, and many of them are very dim. If you start shining more brightly, every other candle in the room can see that, and then it feels pulled to shine a little more brightly. And it creates a cascade.  <br>And we are all participating in that right now. And actually, this is a very hopeful message because if one awakened person is much more powerful than many who are asleep—in terms of how they affect the collective consciousness—it’s disproportionately beneficial.  <br>Like, one awakened person has a bigger impact than many who are not, who are just unconsciously going through life. So, if you wake up, face your own fears—like, for real—be honest with yourself, and choose love and peace and joy and freedom in new ways, however you can, small ways, then you are helping.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: Absolutely. And do you think that’s the same as shadow work when people are saying that they’re doing shadow work?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Okay, and so—I know that you’re very keen on language and using the proper words, but I’m just curious. Like, would you say that, for each person, healing and loving—if I just said, if you had two things you had to do, say healing and loving—focus on healing and loving your whole life. Is that—does that seem like a positive?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Absolutely, yes. That’s the main thing. Healing and loving, absolutely. And actually, they’re synonymous too. Ultimately, they’re synonymous because healing is like working through something that’s not love and returning.  <br>Like, you have to go through the darkness. See, shadow work—you know, that just means like, go look in the dark closet for real. And I’ve used this metaphor before, but I think it’s pertinent. I’ll share it really quick.  <br>When my father was a little boy, he was afraid of his closet in his room. And every night, he would go to sleep, and he was afraid of the closet because he thought there were monsters in the closet. And then one night, he’s like, “I’m so sick of being afraid.” And he charged into that closet, and he fully expected to be eaten by the monsters.  <br>And he sat on the floor, and he was trembling, and his heart was racing, and he was like, “All right, monsters, eat me. Eat me. I’m sick of being afraid. Eat me.” And the monsters did not eat him because there were no monsters.  <br>It took him many months of self-torment as a kid before he got up the nerve to go into that closet and go see and face his crap. That’s a metaphor for what we do with our fears. It takes us years sometimes of pain and suffering before we finally go, “You know what? I’m so sick of being afraid. I’m so sick of feeling shame. Or I’m so sick of feeling like I’m not free. Or I’m so sick of feeling powerless.”  <br>Whatever it is, we actually go deeply feel the feelings. Let the darkness—basically, we don’t say no when the darkness arises because it will arise if it wants to be healed. Your body, your energy body, it will bring it up time and again. That’s okay.  <br>I’ve experienced that. I’ve experienced such neurochemical lows as my energy body went to heal and integrate this fear that the pain is beyond description. I’ve experienced that. I’ve experienced states where I cannot feel good. It’s not possible. But it’s okay because then that is the context that consciousness is wearing.  <br>Can I not reject that? That heals it. Not saying no to it, but actually being with this present moment, even when darkness has arisen, even when pain has arisen, saying yes to it. That’s shadow work. Saying yes.  <br>Because one other thing—because when you say yes in this now to that vibration, you are saying it to all the nows. That’s you’re saying one life can affect their lifetimes. They’re all happening in the one now. So, if you process—if you face something—not even process—if you say yes to something now, if you open your aperture so wide that you feel something that you never let yourself feel before now—face a trauma that you’ve experienced now—if you do that in this now, you do it for all the nows.  <br>And you don’t have—and you’ll never have to experience it again. You don’t do it to get rid of it, though. It will heal it, but you don’t do it in order to heal it. You do it in order to listen and to feel and to say, “I don’t reject you.”  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. You totally freaked me out with that story because I have the same exact story as your father. I literally—my brother put a Skeletor glow-in-the-dark head in the closet, and so I was terrified of the closet. And one morning, the family was looking for me. We lived in like a three-bedroom apartment with like 20 people. It was insane in the Bronx.  <br>And they couldn’t find me. They wanted to call the police. Like, “We cannot find her.” And thankfully, I snored back then, apparently, so they started to hear me snoring, and they’re like, “She’s in the closet, hugging the Skeletor mask.” Really?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yes. So, we had very similar—your father and I had the same kind of conquering our fear.  <br>Interviewer: So, now you’re not afraid of Skeletor masks anymore?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Not anymore. Not anymore. And if somebody brought a Skeletor mask into your room, it wouldn’t need to feel afraid. And it might feel even a little silly.  <br>So, that’s kind of like if someone brings the physical universe into your experience, and you’ve integrated it and not said no—and said yes to everything—it doesn’t need to cause fear.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, I think that’s this whole moment right here was what needed to be said. I’m getting goosebumps. I have very few questions left. We’re going to be able to close in time.  <br><br><br>For people who are advanced—I’m kind of going back to what we were talking about—the soul that has advanced and gone back and is more—whatever that means—more in some ways. Do you feel like they open doors to higher dimensions? Because I’ve heard that before—kind of getting the keys.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Okay, awesome. Yeah, so let’s just say—okay, so if you have known and processed something very low, then that means you are capable of experiencing a high to that degree and more, actually. So, that’s one of—you know, that’s the benefit of duality is that we utilize it as a creative tool, and through integrating that low, we permit a high that otherwise is not knowable.  <br>You see, like, if you never left the light and you were only ever the light and you had no contrast, how would you know what the light even meant? You see? So, you know, it’s like what God offers us is that, well, if you can be something you’re not, and through that, we deepen what we are.  <br>And so, there are reality systems that yes are—I don’t want to say locked, but they’re vibrationally resonant only with those who have evolved to the point where they resonate at that extreme vibration. And that is, you know, that’s done through integration and healing and growth.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, and then I have a question that’s—I don’t know, it’s kind of a weird question, but again, I read something recently that’s in my head, and you did mention—like, you’re talking about the light, we talk about the darkness. There are some people who say the void is peaceful. It feels like a womb. It’s a great place to be.  <br>And there are others who are terrified and have a whole another experience about it and even say that you don’t want to be in the void. Like, that’s a bad sign if you find yourself there. But then I read an NDE or something last night—it was just mine. I just—I love it. I’m going to make sure I put it on my channel—where she’s saying that the actual darkness—like, I’ve heard this before—I would love to hear your thoughts on this—that the darkness came before the light.  <br>I’ve heard this before where the darkness is where—that the light came from the darkness. And in her NDE, she’s saying that the darkness is actually all the possibilities. And I’ve heard this as well about the void being a place of creation where the light can be created from this dark. Like, okay, that the darkness is uncreated light.  <br>That with a being like us, if we bring our focus in the void and we desire to have light, we can take the—I would say maybe dark matter—I don’t know if that’s the right term—but just whatever that is in there and make it—like, open it into light, create it into light, create into creation, into planets, into universes.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, let me—yeah, so the void being empty of anything and also pregnant with all possibility is a relatively common experience. So, there’s a metaphor I think that really helps for this. This is Tom Campbell’s metaphor, and I think it explains the void really well.  <br>The void is like a loading screen. So, it’s like consciousness when not engaged in any reality system. So, it’s pregnant because you can load anything on the computer. It’s terrifying for some to go there from a place of ego because it completely strips egoic reference points because you’re no longer the name or the belief or the body or anything that was protecting you from your fear.  <br>It can’t exist in the void. It’s not there. And so, without that, you may feel fear that was already there. The void didn’t make fear. It’s not a fearful place. It’s just an exposing place because there’s no form of protection. It’s just full of—not emptiness, but—we’re getting—this is hard to talk about, of course—but it’s just empty of form and yet full of all potential.  <br>So, when you talk about light—well, any physical experience of light or any sensory experience of light may be created from the void, of course, because now you’re bringing something to nothing. But when I talk about the light of consciousness, I’m actually talking about that which is the fundamental substrate.  <br>You could say the background to the void or the—it’s not a great way to put it—the substance that really truly is. And then the void is what it is—what it looks at when it’s not looking at any form at all.  <br>This is very hard to talk about. Think of it like a loading screen on a computer. It can load any program you want, but when you’re in the loading screen, you’re not your video game character anymore. So, that can be scary if you thought you were the video game character. But the loading screen itself—there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s just full of possibility because you can load anything you want.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. And I love the way that you mentioned or described yourself like when—that holy moment that you had. So, of course, I want to ask, what did God look like to you? Or did you see God or an expression of God? But in you seeing yourself like almost like you say—like a sun or like a star. The sun was in me. The sun was in my body. It was in all the galaxies were within me, within us, within God. Beautiful.  <br>Okay, so did you have a sense of what God looked like? Or did it appear to you in a certain way?  <br>Christian Sundberg: So, that’s a very human question because we like to think of, “Tell me what the object looked like because now I understand.” So, objects are given existence. Like, objects don’t have existence. Existence has objects. So, I’m saying that’s a Rupert Spira quote. I’m saying that because it would be incorrect to assign God some words and now that’s what God looks like and not these other. That’s—we can’t do that.  <br>God—oh my gosh, this is so—I could talk for an hour just with poetic language about this. But it is the most personal lover, parent, friend, body that you are and that you are a part of. You are the tiniest little drop within the mightiest thing. And that mightiest thing is absolutely incredibly loving and wise to 10 trillion trillion trillion trillion degrees.  <br>And that thing, when it communicated with me, was not like, “Oh, hi, I’m like a horse or something.” No, it was like the all and beyond. It was not—it was much bigger than just our universe. Our universe is like a corner. But everything in the universe was an expression.  <br>Like, consciousness—wording is so hard. Consciousness is a part of God. All of consciousness, you could say. This is really hard to describe. And everything is known as it is experienced by consciousness within consciousness. So, when you know the full body of consciousness, of course, all forms and their expressions are known within you, and it doesn’t feel strange. It’s very, very familiar.  <br>It’s like a song. It’s like a song of joy and endless bliss and radiance and freedom. And it never ends. And it’s—I know this maybe I’m not being—maybe I’m not being helpful. I try not to use super poetic language because, like, that doesn’t—you know, we got a lot of poetry out there.  <br>I’ll just say that like even the sun—the sun was a very, very, very small piece of this universe, but it was huge, and it had all a consciousness to it, and it was raging with bliss. Like a raging fire of bliss. And it was in me, and it was just so blissful. Oh my gosh, like—thinking about it hurts so much because it’s like, “I want that. I want to go back.” But it’s okay. I’m just allowing. I allow myself to feel that huge distance.  <br>Anyway, so there’s no language that can perfectly articulate it.  <br>Interviewer: I love that. But very sentient. Very, very, very wise and unspeakably loving. So loving that it could just destroy you with love, but it doesn’t. You know, something like that. It’s like—it’s so hard to—it’s so—and it’s so personal to all of us. Like, it’s a thing we all know the most. We’re all looking for God all the time. We just don’t know what we’re doing.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, like the big problem—the big problem here is that it seems like God is gone.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. And it’s not. But he, she, it is not.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah.  <br>Interviewer: I had other questions—not important questions—but I feel like this whole energy here was just so healing, and I loved how you became almost poetic and how you were describing God because it seems like that’s what happens. Like, if you really try to start to describe God, you can’t, but you start going into poetry and prose. So, I love that. I love the energy that came around this whole moment.  <br>And I’m just going to leave it there. I’m going to let that be the last thing that people can hold and take home with them. For the most part, I just want to say one thing to everybody listening: you are that too.  <br>That is the most mighty reminder. If we can ping into each other here and remind each other of the love because even though you may not remember consciously what I’m like trying in terrible words to describe, you know, like deep down, you know. And I trust that you know because it’s what we are.  <br>So, I’m just lifting that up because that is the most valuable message. You know, people always say, “Oh, can you share your story?” I’m happy to share my story, but that is not important compared to this. This is what this is all about—what we really are, which cannot be described.  <br>If we can touch into that even just a little bit here, we will shine that light here in this extreme limitation. The world heals through it. We heal through it. That’s very, very, very powerful stuff.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, I’ll let that be your take-home message. Yeah, thank you so much. Thank you for the love and for your walk. And thank you, everybody who’s listening today, for being here and for being human today.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, it’s beautiful. Beautiful.  <br>Interviewer: And how do people reach you? And the name of your book and all that, and then we’ll close off.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so my book is called A Walk in the Physical. It’s available for free on my website, awalkinthephysical.com, on the book page, third link down. It’s not about—I just want to share this message though. It is available in print or Kindle or audiobook for those who are interested.  <br>So, I get a lot of emails, so I apologize if I can’t respond or if I respond super late. But my email is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com" target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com</a>, and my website, awalkinthephysical.com, has many different talks that I’ve participated in on the talks page if you’re interested.  <br>Interviewer: Beautiful, beautiful. Christian, I just—I feel the authenticity, and it’s—I just thank you so much. I thank you so much for being strong enough to share this message. I just thank you so much, really, truly, from the bottom of my heart.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Thank you.  <br>Interviewer: All right, blessings, brother.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Blessings to you. I felt your energy before, you know, when you emailed me. I try to be—I just try to follow intuition. It’s like you said, it’s not about channel size. I don’t—this is not about size. Yeah, it’s about love and the feeling of what you are doing is powerful and important. And I know you may not feel that way about yourself all the time, but you are—you know, the new age term is a light worker. You know, you are someone who is doing it where you are. So, please be encouraged.  <br>Interviewer: Thank you. I knew I needed this conversation. Like, you’re helping me in a very low moment. So, I thank you so much, brother. I really do. I send you so much—  <br>Christian Sundberg: Welcome, sister. Much love. ]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2024/he-remembers-being-with-god-and-says,-god-is-unspeakably-loving.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2024/HE REMEMBERS BEING WITH GOD AND SAYS, GOD IS UNSPEAKABLY LOVING.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:06:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Man Travels to The Other Side, Reveals Why There Are Difficult And Happy Life on Earth]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1rk9Dd0BzA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1rk9Dd0BzA</a><br>16 JUL 2024<br>This is so hard to describe. The Great I Am presence of all things, what we call God, came to me and expanded me back out. I felt all the universe within me. I felt all the stars, all the galaxies, and I felt our son, the son of Earth, within me like it was a part of my body. I can only say that I feel that the vibration of the collective Consciousness is increasing. That is happening even though there's a lot of friction on the surface.  <br><br><br>Hi, thank you so much for having me on. My name is Christian Sundberg. My body is 44 years old right now. So, 14 years ago, I went through a personal Awakening process. I began to have out-of-body experiences, and I had pre-birth memory returned to me. I remember the process of choosing this life and why. I remember the Incarnation process, and it has been very life-changing for me.  <br>Up until the age of 30, I did not remember it, though as a very young child, I did have some pre-birth memory awareness up until the age of five or six. So, between five and 30 approximately, I had no memory of this. But now, I'm very passionate about sharing who we really are outside the Earth play because who we really are is so wonderful. Our true nature is so much love, peace, and joy. So, I'm just so passionate about sharing that with each other while we're here playing these human characters that we play.  <br><br><br>I'll share about my pre-birth experience again. I have to just say once more that language can't speak to this. Okay, so I remember a long ago, before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical and feeling telepathically from him the quality of his Essence, his nature. Because in those Realms, we can feel from each other our nature, our quality. I could sense from this being this incredible depth of freedom, power, and love.  <br>I asked him, "Oh my gosh, like how do you, what did you do to become this? Do you feel as much Freedom as I feel that you feel?" And he shared with me, yes. He shared with me this great depth of being that he knew. I asked, "How did you do that?" And he said, "Well, okay, so he'd share a number of things, but a chief among them, he had lived physical lives, and one of them, in particular, was a very difficult physical life where he suffered from a physical health condition that stayed with him for a long time. The way that he chose to meet that health condition allowed a refinement of his being. He grew, you could say he evolved. It's poor language, but he deepened, maybe refined who he was to such a degree that, oh my gosh, it was just so beautiful."  <br>And I said, "I want to do that. I want to do that." Like, I was so inspired. And he said something, well, first, it was something along the lines of, "Well, that's what they all say. Like, you just don't know how hard it is, how hard it can be." Because I was just ignorant to how challenging a physical life could potentially be because I hadn't been physical before in this way.  <br>And I persisted. I said, "No, really, like to do this. I mean, this is amazing." And he said, "Well, go talk to your guides." So, I don't have right after that, but I did live many times, and I went and found this being later, and he was encouraging.  <br>But the majority of my pre-birth memory is of a Time somewhat immediately preceding this life. So, I had lived, and after I had passed, I took a long break in between lives. I remember this guide coming back to me over and over, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And just like gently putting him off, like, "No, I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready yet." And finally saying, "Okay, yes, I'm ready now."  <br>And then reviewing with this guide my state, like who I am, what I had known, what I had been. It was very obvious the thing I needed to work on. I don't like the words "work on" because it's not a task, but I could see and feel what would be best for me to do. It was this very specific fear that had bested me in a previous experience, and I could see that if I could integrate that fear, heal that fear, that would be an amazing expansion for myself and for the whole through the integration of that fear.  <br>So, they brought me a life that was very appropriate to meet and process that fear. It wasn't this life; it was an immediately preceding life. I reviewed that life in great detail, and I accepted that life. Then, I remember accepting the veil. The veil is just the word we use for the limitations in Consciousness that we wear in order to have the physical experience, and it includes forgetting. That's like one of the chief things: we forget everything else that we are.  <br>But I experienced it as a plummet in vibration, down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more lower, more like the vibration in my being going from being connected to everything and in total Bliss and love all the way down, down, down, down, down, lower, so low, and then lower more, and then lower more into this very, very dense, empty feeling but dense experience of being physical and having all my knowing cut off and all my memory disappear.  <br>And I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm not doing this. There's no way." Like, I could feel that emptiness and that denseness, and I felt disconnected from everything. So, I responded in Fear, and I summoned my might, and I fought my way out. I pushed past the veil. I broke past the veil, and I was successful in doing that.  <br>But I had a Life review because I could see that I'd killed the body. I'd killed the fetus that was to be mine, and in my life review, I could see how my fear impacted the poor mother because I had heaped grief upon her. Not only the mother, but hundreds of other people, like in ripples away from the mother, because the mother's Journey was more difficult. I had made hundreds of other people's Journeys more difficult because of my fear and my rejection of that life.  <br>And I could just see very objectively, like, "Oh man, I got to do something about this." Like, from that state of being, you know, it's okay. Like, nothing's wrong; it's just like a big play. You can't actually fail. But I also could just see very objectively, like, "Wow, I have a lot of fear. I need to do something about that."  <br>So, I still had this intention to meet this fear and to process this fear. So, then I spent some time in what I would call a veil acceptance simulator. I know this sounds crazy, but it was like a room where you go and practice surrendering your control to a veil, like being dunked underwater in a pool over and over, but you can cry Uncle. You know, you can say, "Let me out," and I'll let you out because that was just practice.  <br>And I could tell you, the real Veil is more difficult than the simulator. So, okay, but then later, I remember them bringing me this life as Christian, and this life was very appropriate, but it wasn't as good as the first one would have been. It was a good match, but it wasn't as perfect.  <br>And I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail, reviewing millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold. It was like reviewing a flowchart of possibilities, like if someone took a tree and laid the tree on its side, and you started at the trunk, the thick part, and you worked your way out to the branches. It was like that, where the branches were all the possibilities that might unfold in the life depending on my choices and the choices of every other player in the game, every other person.  <br>And I could see events, but it wasn't primarily about events. It was primarily about what would it be like to be me, like what would I feel, what would I experience. That was really what the review was primarily about.  <br>And I remember making certain requests for this life. For instance, I asked to be intelligent again. I knew that I had been intelligent in recent lives, and they said, "Yes, you can do that." And I knew that it would be important that I be male in this life, just because of a certain energy. Like, male and female just have different energies, and there was a certain obtuse Edge, you could say, to being male that would help me to meet the fear.  <br>And I could see that my parents were very important. Like, my father would instill confidence in me, and then that confidence would be important for me to have a rock to stand on when the fear hit later in life.  <br>So, after reviewing it in detail, I remember there having to be a moment to say yes. And I don't remember that moment, but I remember being in a waiting area, and this guide coming to me and being like, "Go now, like right now," really grabbing my attention.  <br>And then being in this room that I can only describe as a technician's chamber or like a tinkerer's shop, where there were these beings who are very technical in nature, and they are Veil application technicians, something like that. I know this sounds really strange, but their very nature is skilled at matching Veil to soul for a given life because each soul is so complex with all its qualities, and each physical life has so much Rich context.  <br>And they do this thing where they make it Jive, they make it fit. So, I could feel them preparing the veil, and I was standing over this shaft with the Earth below me, and they asked me one last time, "Are you sure?" And I knew that once I said yes, I would be in for the ride, like a roller coaster. Once you get on, you can't get off until it comes to a stop.  <br>And I said yes. And then once again, I remember this plummet in vibration, down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more lower, still low, low, low, even more, then lower more, then lower more. It was ridiculous. It was such a drop, and having all of my knowing cut off and all of my connectedness disappear.  <br>And then being in this very dense, empty, cold, by comparison, not cold temperature, cold energetically, state of being in the womb, feeling like just totally crammed into a tiny, dense object, and also feeling separated from everybody else and everything else.  <br>And sending one message back to the technicians, "Did it take? Did the veil take?" Because I knew that if I had not rejected the veil like I had done the first time, then it would be a successful start to a journey.  <br>And they sent one message back, "Yes." And so, then I actually felt accomplished because I knew that even making it to the physical is a big accomplishment because the vibration here is so low that even just making it to this place is an amazing step. It's an amazing journey.  <br>Okay, so then I was there for a while, and eventually, I said, "I'm not doing this. There's no way. This is so dark. This is so empty. I can't feel my connectedness. This is so low vibration. I am not going to tolerate this for a whole lifetime."  <br>So, once again, I began to summon my strength to fight my way out, and as I did that, the most holy moment of my whole life happened. This is so hard to describe. The Great I Am presence of all things, what we call God, came to me and expanded me back out.  <br>I felt all the universe within me. I felt all the stars, all the galaxies, and I felt our son, the son of Earth, within me like it was a part of my body. And it was churning with bliss. It was like this raging ball of bliss, just amazing and conscious and alive, and all of it was alive, and it was all within me.  <br>And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And that calmed me because I was like, "Oh, I didn't lose all that I am. I see." So, I stopped fighting, and I turned to just being in the womb.  <br><br><br>So, then it felt like I was in the womb for a long time, and then the next memory I have is the day I was born. I remember the shock of being born, the temperature, the sound, the touching, the lights. I remember being very curious.  <br>And yeah, and then as I grew, I remember looking back at the pre-birth memory, the flowchart memory in particular, and trying to see what I could predict about what was going to happen based on what I had seen before I had incarnated. Just small things, like as a child, "Is someone going to come to the house tomorrow?" or "Where are we going to go as a family?"  <br>I would just try to pull the information out of the flowchart just for fun, and that ability diminished as I aged. You know, until probably about the age of four or five, I couldn't do that anymore. And then about the age of five or six, I couldn't remember it at all.  <br>So, that's a quick summary of the pre-birth experience. I've shared it a number of times now. I'm happy to share it, but I don't think it's the most important thing. I think what's far more important is the reminder of who we really are, each of us.  <br>My experience is just my experience, but what's more important is your experience. You know, what are you really? What are we really? We are really multi-dimensional beings of love, peace, joy, and freedom. That is our true nature, and we have come deeply into this veiled experience of Separation.  <br>Yes, like we are very deeply experiencing this perspective, but it doesn't change what we really are. And if we know what we really are, we recognize there's nothing to fear. There is absolutely nothing to be afraid of. Like, all of the fear can only arise when we buy into self-perceptions that are ultimately not true.  <br>So, I think it's so important that we share with each other and remind each other, even while we're veiled here, who we really are and the great power that is available to us and the great love that is there for us. Oh my gosh, it's so important. It's so powerful.  <br><br><br>I can only say that I feel that the vibration of the collective Consciousness is increasing. That is happening even though there's a lot of friction on the surface. You know, a lot of apparent conflict and apparent disharmony, but in energy space, the energy is definitely increasing. The vibration of the human race is moving in the direction towards love.  <br>Like, even what I sense now versus 10 years ago is very noticeably different. So, I can't make a prediction about exactly where the human race will end up. I think it's likely that we will succeed in Awakening and really heal, but we have a lot of choices to make.  <br>The odds are probably in our favor. We have a lot of help, a lot of help from the other side that's assisting us and guiding us day-to-day as we make these choices, hopefully more out of love rather than fear. That's what all this is about. This whole thing is about, can we make choices that are based in love and everything love means rather than fear and everything fear means, the ego, and everything else?  <br>Can we make those love-based choices? That small space decisioning that each of us is doing is where we're changing and growing, and it actually does help the whole, the larger framework that we see around us. You know, the governments, the companies, the monetary systems, those are all things we made up as humans. So, as we change, they will change over time.  <br><br><br>This life is potentially very hard, yes, because we have incarnated into a place of great limitation. So, it's not actually that this life has to be hard; it's only that we've come to a place of extreme limitation. So, it's like going to Mount Everest is a good metaphor. You know, that tall mountain that everybody climbs when they're really at the Pinnacle of their Mountain peaking career or whatever.  <br>It's not that Mount Everest has innate qualities. It has certain properties of limitation. It's cold; there's no air. You know, it's kind of like being on Earth. And when it's this dense, this limiting, when we feel this degree of separation, it means it's very possible that when we are yet unevolved, when we have yet Evolution to do, we've growing to do, that we might respond in fear.  <br>You see, fear is just a symptom of unevolvedness. That's all it is. But fear gives rise to all sorts of pain and suffering on Earth. It gives rise to the ego and to all the beliefs, all the us versus them mentality, all the judgments, all the anger, all the hatred. You know, it comes out of fear, and that fear is just so.  <br>It's just that Earth is a very high limitation environment that has the potential to prompt fear in us. As we prepare to move into this new time in Consciousness, I think it's important to focus on our own place, and what I mean is our own State of Consciousness first.  <br>Don't worry so much about everyone else. Don't worry about what's on the news so much. It's important that we remain cognizant of it. We want to know what's going on, but what I mean is your primary place of work is your own Consciousness, your own self, your own life.  <br>Basically, can you move towards your own personal love, peace, freedom, and joy in whatever way in your own life, even if it's a small way? And can you work past your fear? Can you heal your own fear? Can you look at your own fear and really process it?  <br>Those two edges of the coin, you know, choosing love, growing towards love, and yet also not being afraid of the dark, facing the pain, facing the fear, owning it, processing it, healing it. Those are both synonymous. They're both a move back towards the truth, which is love.  <br>And so, if we do that in our own lives, in our own minds, and our own Hearts, oh, that is the real work. And a change in you is a change for the whole Collective consciousness. So, if you shift that in yourself, you are doing far more than enough. Like, that's you're doing a lot if you do that in yourself.  <br>And then, as you do that in yourself, of course, we will be there for each other. We will reach out and both physically try to impact the world and help those around us, but also, we then automatically energetically do that. We help each other, but it does start with where you are in your own life.  <br>So, basically, you're free to choose love, peace, freedom, and joy, and you're free to own and face your fears, your deepest fears, the deepest rejection, whatever you're rejecting in this life. Like, that's another way to put it. Like, we can participate in the Awakening by finding our own rejection.  <br>Maybe we even reject the negative states of the world, and then we lose our peace. Do you need to lose your peace? No, no, you can actually like, basically, rejection of reality is what fear does. It is, in a sense, the primary problem that everybody is rejecting what is Arisen and fighting and pushing.  <br>So, can you accept yourself? Can you accept your life? Can you accept this reality? Can you accept so deeply that you then own your piece of it and shine in love and joy right where you are, knowing the freedom that you have, that there's nothing that you really have to do too?  <br>Like, can you sense that true nature that you are where you are, that is doing enough for the whole planet and The Awakening on the planet? This life can be extremely difficult. I'm not underplaying or understating the level of rigor and pain that is possible here. It can be extreme.  <br>You know, it's like wearing a thousand pounds on you, being human, and when there's pain or disease or when you're in a society that is particularly dysfunctional or you're under economic duress or whatever else. I mean, each one of those things changes the constraints. It can make it easier or harder, but the thing is, no matter what has arisen in the physical, there's a great quote I love from Bashar: "Circumstances don't matter; only state of being matters."  <br>Okay, so that may sound a little cheesy until you really investigate it because what's happening is form is arising within Consciousness. So, Consciousness always retains the power. So, when you feel powerless, when you feel that you've become deeply wrapped up in the form and in the stories, take pause and investigate your own Consciousness.  <br>Meditate is a way to say that. I love there's a phrase from Asia, I don't know which country, but something to the effect of, "Meditate for an hour a day unless you don't have time, and then meditate for two." I find that that's appropriate when our lives get very hectic and when we get overwhelmed by the content because the more we look at it, the more we rehearse those chaos stories in our mind, the more difficult it can be to see clearly and feel clearly.  <br>So, it's important that we take pause and evaluate very objectively in our own Consciousness, "What am I in the midst of this?" Seek the eye very objectively with great alertness. Go investigate the eye, and that will allow us to get a foothold to stand on in Consciousness so that we can better see the thoughts for what they are and see the forms for what they are.  <br>Okay, so that's one thing. And then another thing is recognize that we are placing all the meaning on what has arisen, even if it's hard. Like, nothing arrives already charged, even pain. It's not already bad when it arrives. It's just a sensation. It's just alarming to the body, but it's not bad.  <br>Like, we always assign meaning to our lives. So, we can locate, "Okay, where have I named this rigorous context as terrible? Where have I done that?" Now, that takes a lot of humility, bravery, a lot of willingness to feel because it means owning our place in the story, but there's a lot of power in that.  <br>We are Consciousness first. We can own the meaning that we have put on our story. Okay, and then the third thing I would say, meanwhile, don't be discouraged because this entire play is happening in a much, much, much deeper context that is made of love, peace, joy, and we are watched over always. All is always well, even if the world is crashing down around us.  <br>And I'm not making light of the rigor and density that crashing down can evoke, but in the meantime, the first two about Finding who we really are in Consciousness and recognizing the meaning that we're playing, those empowering steps, those the side, even if we haven't done that yet or can't do that yet, at least in our intellectual space, we can know, just remind ourselves intellectually, "Oh, I really am a multi-dimensional being. I may not be able to see it very clearly right now, but there is nothing to fear."  <br>Know that. Remind yourself of it, and then check, like, as I say that, like, you may, if you really check into yourself deeply, intuitively, how does it feel if someone says, "You are a multi-dimensional being of love. You have nothing to fear. Like, you are powerful. You are worthy. You are so loved, like so ridiculously loved, you personally."  <br>Surely, you can feel deep down that we resonate with that because the part of us that is deep down knows the truth. It always knows the truth. So, even if we're in the midst of this very challenging circumstance set, we can listen to that deep down voice. It's always lifting up the real encouragement, the real hope, and the knowing that there is nothing to fear and that you will get through this. It will be okay.  <br>Start there. So, I think probably backwards order, so maybe 32. Once, start with knowing it. Second, identify the meaning you've put on the circumstance. And then three, go find out tangibly what your own Consciousness is. Just three ideas to speak to your question about what we can do if the life has become so physically challenging, so difficult.  <br><br><br>We do choose our lives, yes. We choose our lives, usually with the help of guides who are very wise beings who help us to evaluate the opportunities of lives. Every soul is different. We all have our own Journeys, our own walks.  <br>In my case, I had a very specific goal. Goal is a bad word, a very specific energetic aim, and they brought me lives that were appropriate. Like, they went and reviewed the databases, you could say, and they're very wise, and they could find a good match, you know, a life that had a fruitful match.  <br>Now, I know that to the human who is suffering, it may be very hard to understand why we would choose a life that has so much pain in it or so much limitation. You know, like, "Oh, why didn't I choose to be rich or to have an easy life?"  <br>Okay, but the thing is, the soul is not after a small experience of wealth, physical wealth. The soul is after deep, Eternal, true expansion of being and growth, which is the deepening of love and joy. See, that's what it's after.  <br>And so, through contrast, contrast is a tool that has been offered to us, and so we may choose lives of high contrast, especially in a certain area, if we want to learn, not intellectually learn, but learn at the being level, learning by being something.  <br>If we want to learn some perspective, some virtue, some quality, some experience, some angle of experience, you know, that is what the contrast offers. Yes, we do sign up for lives so that we can experience something, grow in a certain direction that is Meaningful to us at the higher level.  <br>And by the way, when I say the soul and the higher level, I don't mean some other being. I mean you. Like, sometimes we think, "Oh, my soul signed me up for this. Now I'm pissed." You know, but no, you are your soul. You see, you are the bigger you having the experience of being a smaller you.  <br>You are you. You're always you, and so you, at the deeper level, had some reason, some meaning. And also, the other thing I'll say is sometimes we come primarily out of service. You know, like, sometimes there might be someone that we know or love, and they're coming to experience something, and you know, we know we could help them and be there for them.  <br>Like, maybe we would sign up for a whole physical life just to have one conversation with somebody at one moment that they really need it. You know, there's so many reasons. It's difficult to nail it down because the soul is very rich and complex, so its intentions are also rich and complex and unique, very unique.  ]]></description><link>https://awakening2024.neocities.org/sundberg-video-full/2024/man-travels-to-the-other-side,-reveals-why-there-are-difficult-and-happy-life-on-earth.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sundberg Video full/2024/Man Travels to The Other Side, Reveals Why There Are Difficult And Happy Life on Earth.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:06:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[MINDBLOWING!

It sees from every perspective. It records it all. It knows it all. So when we review our lives, we see it from everyone's perspective, not just our own, because they are us. And then we can see that they chose their choices because they were dealing with challenging things too. Yeah, you know? And that's really what this world of hurt is. It's a challenged, fear-based intentionality running rampant. So we don't answer that with more fear, you know, with more surrender of power. We don't need to do that.<br><br><br>Today, I'd like to welcome back to the show a very special friend and special guest, Christian Sundberg. Christian, welcome!<br>
Thank you so much. I'm happy to be here.<br>
I'm so happy to have you back. I interviewed you a year ago, which was actually my first episode of Conscious Conversations, and here we are a year later. So there's lots and lots to celebrate. But the truth is, I could have talked to you for hours and hours and hours. We're just going to dive right into some of the things we talked about in our last interview and go deeper, if that works for you.<br>
Definitely, let's do it.<br>
Awesome, awesome. Okay, so as we talked before we started recording, there are all kinds of questions I have for you. But to kick it off, in our last interview towards the end, one of the things you said that stuck with me in this past year—I always hear your voice saying this—is that there is nothing to fear, that we really have nothing to fear.<br>
Yes. And I can connect to that, not all the time, but I can. And I want to know more. I want to know what you would have to say more about having nothing to fear, especially with so much fear-mongering happening in today's world.<br><br><br>So, first of all, just a quick disclaimer that there's no good way to talk about any of these things. I mean, we're going to get into spiritual language because it's what we've got, but language is very limiting. And I feel that with questions like this, it's important to get right to the heart of what's going on because we have to go really deep to see the truth of the fact that there's nothing to fear. Yes, so we could say beingness itself, consciousness itself, the substance of life itself, is already whole. It's already perfect. It's already connected to all things. It's not lacking anything. Okay? It's not lacking in any life or power. That is so. So that is like our true nature. Our true nature is total peace, love, and joy. Like that. And that is not tarnished. It's just the enduring substance of life. It's just what it is. It can't be anything else.<br>Except that we've taken this deep but artificial step into association with form. Okay? That means with all the objects, the stories, the bodies, the identities, and all the rest. And then, in that form association, we buy into perceptions that are not in alignment with the truth. So we buy into perceptions of being powerless, or being not free, or being unworthy of love.<br>Those are some of the big ones. I mean, then there are many branches from those. But as we bind into those perceptions, we do it so quick. Like, this happens so fast. And it doesn't even require the social context, though that can certainly stimulate it and add to it. What I mean by that is, even in my case, when I first incarnated before I was even born, the density and the rigor of being this limited and feeling like I was cut off from everything—you know, because here we experience such a degree of separation—oh my gosh, it's just crazy how separate we feel from each other and from the whole. We don't feel that unconditional love like every second. So in that state, it just, if we haven't integrated it all the way, if we haven't processed it all the way, it prompts fear. Okay?<br>So I'm lifting that up though because even though that deep illusion of form has prompted fear, the true substance of being can't be anything other than what it is. And that is the much, much, much more enduring fundamental truth. Okay? So now that we're here though, we get wrapped up in all these stories and all these identities, and we haven't processed everything all the way yet. We have what we could simply say is unevolved in this. That just means we haven't really come to terms with all this and figured out how to be—not just be, but actualize our loving nature here in this great set of limitations yet. We haven't done that yet. <br>And so we feel all sorts of fear. And then all sorts of ego shenanigans come out of that fear because the ego is just the part of us trying to fix the problem. Like, "Oh my gosh, I have no power now. So, oh look, I'm going to believe this and feel better. Oh look, I'm going to hurt this person next to me and feel better. Oh look, us versus them. My group is now better than your group because I say so. Now look, now I feel better. See, I proclaimed it." It doesn't actually work. Like, we're still wounded as we do that. The ego is just covering up the pain. Right?<br><br><br>But even though that's happening, if we look deep underneath everything, or if we let go of all the form—which can happen at physical death, or it doesn't have to be physical death, it can happen before physical death in consciousness—when we let go of all form, we can find that there was actually never any real fundamental reason to be afraid. Now, but here on the surface, we are in a place of great density. And the human race has got a lot of fear in the basement. Oh my gosh, like our basement as a collective consciousness is full of so much crap. Yeah, like thousands and thousands of years of crap. And we are going through this awakening process in spirit, which means that we are basically processing through the crap. But there's a lot of crap down there. And as the vibration increases, that compels the crap to come up and be faced and processed and dealt with. And so then we see a surface, an external surface of circumstance—political circumstance included, as you mentioned—that reflects these old fear-based ideas that are just deep in our consciousness that we're trying to come to terms with and work through and work past.<br>When we see that, it can feel really overwhelming and frustrating. You know, it could feel like this context is so big and it has all the power. Like the politicians have all the power, and the corporations have all the power. No, this is so important. This is so, so... I'm very passionate about this. The power lies in that which gave rise to the entire physical experience itself, the entire physical universe. You could say that that has the true power. That the true power is not in human systems. It's not in throwing rocks or moving money around. Like, that is very small local power by comparison. And the true power, which actually has the ability to directly influence the physical through manifestation and through consciousness itself, is consciousness. And you are consciousness. We are consciousness. So all that is to say, we do ourselves a huge disservice when we lose ourselves in hopelessness. Like, when we see the hugeness of the physical context and get overwhelmed, and then we almost unconsciously surrender our power to it. We, as multi-dimensional powerful creative beings, are inadvertently doing ourselves a disservice. You see, because now we think we don't have the power. And then we don't feel. We feel small. We feel overwhelmed. Our own fear gets triggered. Then we get in fear cycles.<br>In fact, we are powerful beings, and our consciousness is connected to the consciousness of every other player in the game—every other person in the world, every leader you can name, every corporate manager you could name. Like, all the systems are just people. Like, all the governments, all the companies—that's all people. It's all individuals making choices. That's all it is. There's no real system. There's no real government. It's a bunch of people that have a shared idea, and they operate to it every day. That's all it is. And your consciousness is connected to their consciousness. So when you choose to face your own crap—and don't worry so much about everything out there, but I mean, we take ownership for it—but we don't have to let it bring us down. We face our own crap, and we bring love into the world where we are. And we choose hope, and we choose that power. We reclaim our power. And as we do that, it does affect the consciousness of those other people, even if they don't see it.<br><br><br>I went on a big tangent, a long response.<br>
Yeah, well, I loved everything you said. Actually, there were things popping in me. I don't actually know what yet. I'll probably find those out later. But a couple of things that you said just really, really lit me up—the hopelessness, the powerlessness, the separation. And then what you just said about, you know, when we go deep inside, that affects the collective as well. So, you know, I am a big student and teacher of A Course in Miracles. And there are two principles in A Course in Miracles. One is that one loving thought that we have affects the rest of the sonship, which is everybody, the collective. And the other one is that our biggest problem, or our only problem—yes, the source of all problems—is that we believe that we're separate. It's a misunderstanding, like a huge misunderstanding. Yeah. And so I just had this visual of, you know, all of us just kind of going through our days and trying to, you know, get through, and having this, you know, like kind of almost like a, you know, those dogs that have like the cone when they can't—like, we have this cone around our head, you know, and we're just unaware that we're actually connected to...  <br>Yes, yes. So that did something for me. I don't know what.<br>
Yes, very much. I'll just make a quick comment. So your comment about A Course in Miracles and the only error is that again we've associated into something that we're not. So that's saying that's the same as how I started my comment in that we lose ourselves in a negative self-perception that isn't true. And that causes all sorts of fear and shenanigans. Ego rises up out of that. So, I mean, the way I like to put it is, I feel like there are really only two problems on Earth. I mean, there's no true problem, right? But man, it looks like and feels like there's some big problems here. So I'm not making light. I'm not making light of the severity of the suffering on Earth. I'm not. Okay? But all that boils down to two things though, really. <br>One is ignorance, which is the same thing as what we just brought up in A Course in Miracles—that we just don't know who we are. We just don't see. We don't remember. Like, we just don't remember it. We don't commonly, at the human level yet, though it's growing, yes, that we don't commonly know ourselves as the multi-dimensional beings of total freedom that we really are. That's the first thing—that we're just ignorant to it. Our society is ignorant to it. Like, we don't teach our children commonly in school. And if we do, it's through some kind of religious lens or, you know, whatever. So the first is just that we're just ignorant. <br>We just don't know. And the second is fear. And all I mean is that we have not yet fully processed this whole experience. And when we haven't done that, when we're afraid, ego gives rise to 10,000 expressions of hurt and insanity. Like, fear is insane. It's a simple way to put it. Like, all fear is insane. And the ego is in service to fear. Like, when we make fear-intentioned choices, we are, whether we know it or not, adding to the insanity, adding to the suffering cycle. Yeah, yeah.<br>But underneath all that, there is actually no fundamental real reason to fear. Yeah. So when we don't feel it, I feel like looking down those two avenues can be really helpful. So, how can we find what we really are? Well, again, this is not simple to speak to. Okay? It's not like you just perform an action and get a result because we're not talking about physical actions. But meditation. Okay? So basically, go investigate what you are every day in consciousness. Go look, just very objectively, what am I beneath all thought? With full alertness, listen to the silence. <br>You know, feel the silence. Investigate like a scientist—oh, yourself. What am I beneath all thought, beneath all sense data? So just investigate. And because as we do that, it does reveal itself to us. It's not that we so much go see and we don't find some new form. Actually, we find that we, consciousness, we transcend all form. And then that true nature—it can't be afraid because it's the truth. And because it's so full and vast and perfect—ah, I can't even attempt language to describe the nature of being. <br>So, that's the first thing—investigate that. Look through, try to find their way through the ignorance. And also, a part of that is intuition. Like, really listen to your intuition. Like, for real. Not make-up, and not a made-up intuition. Like, I'm saying, like, deep down, what is your soul saying? Okay? And then the second one—fear. Like, if we can just allow ourselves to acknowledge where we have fear, it's okay. Like, there's no judgment here. If you have fear and you are resisting something in your life, and it's a repetitive pattern or something, or you have a pain that's with you because of a fear, go look at it. It's going to—it may be the hardest thing you've ever done. Like, if you really look at those that are down there, take ownership for them. <br>Go look at them. You are worthy to do that. Like, we buy into negative self-perception so deeply here that we don't even know our own worth and our own power to even go look at our own fears. We don't even know they're down there, actually, because the ego covers them up under a thousand layers. And then the world just looks evil, and we don't even realize it's our own fear. Yeah. So as our own fear arises in moments, it's okay that you're afraid. It's okay. Face it. Face it. Process it. Heal it. You know, like, and choose joy where you can. Yeah. If we do those, like, just those two angles, it really helps get to the heart of that suffering that we're all experiencing here. Yeah.<br>What that's bringing up for me right now, when you separated it into two columns, it's like investigate and look at it, and investigate and feel it. Let's say feel it even. Yeah. And I'm sorry to interrupt there. The reason I'm—I just felt this nudge, like, wait, because the investigation is not just an intellectual act. Like, we tend to think, like, you know, I work with a number of people who reach out to me, and I find that a common theme is, "Tell me the actions I can take to relieve my suffering. I don't actually want to go feel it and look in the dark and do the work. <br>I just want you to tell me the actions because I really want to get away from it." That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about actually feeling it, like, for real. Yeah. You know, the deepest, actual experiential processing. That's like, it's not just—I mean, it may start as an intellectual process, and an intellectual process will certainly be a part of it. I'm talking about a very visceral, personal feeling process. Anyway, sorry, I just had to say that.  <br>No, I love it because, you know, I think that we are afraid to look at our fear because we do believe it's real. We're also afraid to feel our feelings. And these processes—what they do, like you said, the ego just has the truth covered in... Can I—I'm sorry to interrupt. I have to say one more thing. I'm sorry. So you made a comment there that I just want to—so you said, "Because we believe our fear is real." Of course, we believe our fear is real. But I just want to point something out. It's that we believe the cause for it is real. The fear itself is—we are feeling what we're feeling. <br>And that is a very important step of this process that I'm trying to lift up. It is full acknowledgement of exactly what you're feeling. Like, it's the opposite of saying, "Oh, this is not real." Right? It's acknowledging, "Oh, I feel terrified. I feel completely unworthy. My whole life has shown me that I have no power," or whatever. Yeah, yeah. I just want to lift that up because it's not that we go in and we say, "Well, this isn't real, so I should be able to take care of it." I mean, it's darn real to you when you're afraid. Yeah. But yeah, this is about the personal work then of going and seeing how you actually feel and, like, basically, fully evaluate your experience with full feeling, full openness, non-rejection. <br>That's like the mantra—not how am I rejecting life, how am I rejecting reality? And then open that door instead of keeping it closed. Yeah, yeah. No, thank you for clarifying that. I, you know, well, the course also talks about how everything is an illusion. And a lot of people can use that concept to spiritually bypass. And so, yes, whatever we're feeling is real to us in the moment. It is real, and it's something up for us. It's happening for us. And what you were saying about how the ego covers the truth with so many layers—and this two-column process—what it did for me is it triggered in me this sense of awareness. And the more that we do the meditation and looking at our fear, we're going to become more aware, and we're going to be able to go deeper.<br><br><br>Now, in your book, A Walk in the Physical, there's an essay that I just read today called "The Authority of Awareness." And I'd love it if you could tell us what the authority of awareness is.<br>
Oh, that's actually really—that's a really deep question. So, what it means is, okay, within the world of form, we forget our power and our authority. Like, we become so wrapped up in the story and in the perceptions and in the smallness. <br>Basically, that's what A Course in Miracles means when it says everything's an illusion. It's not everything's an illusion. It's all form is an illusion, and that which is most real is full of it, and it's real. Okay? So, the authority of awareness means if you believe you can't do something, or you can't question some belief, or you can't open some closed door, or you can't be yourself, that's not true. You are aware. <br>And because you are aware, and as an aware being, you are a part of—okay, this is careful language—but you are a part of God. And so, as a drop in the ocean which has total power and total sovereignty and total authority, so do you. Like, there's no door you're not allowed to look behind. There's no feeling you're not allowed to feel. There's no belief you're not allowed to change. And if you think there is a reason that you can't, you bought into some belief that says you can't. Go find that. <br>I mean, you have to be brave. You have to be brave because, you know, maybe it's a religious context. In your whole life, you're told, "No, you're going to go to hell if you don't believe a certain thing, or if you question a certain belief." Well, now you've associated into that belief. You see, you are consciousness first. You then associated into it. That had to happen first. If you reclaim your own authority to choose what to focus on, that's so simple and so powerful. You have complete authority to choose what to focus on, even if you're in pain. Do you know that? Like, there's no reason you have—like, basically, you have the total authority to wield an intention that you choose. Yeah. That's really important. Yeah.<br>And I'm really glad that we've landed here because I know that that concept, for me—as you know, we talked about before we pressed record—which is some of the stuff going on in the country and with women's rights, it's been that concept for me that's kept me from completely losing hope. <br>Like, if I focus on all of the propaganda that's out there, obviously I don't feel happy, and I don't experience joy. But also, there is this piece of powerlessness that, as these laws are just being decided or passed, there's a feeling of powerlessness as, you know, a woman in this country. It feels like even if I talk about it, I don't have a say. And yet, the truth is that, you know, I am a part of source. And so, if the thoughts and the feelings and all of that exist in me, just like you said at the beginning, they do exist elsewhere too. Like, they're a part of the whole, and not just one. I'm curious what you'd have to add or say to this concept.  <br><br><br>Well, there's a few layers to that. But first thing, I just want to comment briefly, and this is not at all, you know, speaking away or disclaiming or brushing off what you just said. But we're not even human. Like, we're not even human. We are spirit. We're consciousness itself having the experience of being human. We're not even man or woman. We are so knowing both male and female themes deeply and learning them and growing in those strengths because they're both strengths. Yeah. Okay. <br>So, the reason I start with that is because then, like, when we then is the human like, "Oh, I am this person who is in this category, and this category is being, you know, attacked or disempowered by this other group," it's good to acknowledge that that's happening on the surface, of course. This is, I mean, everything we're talking about is having our eyes open, not dismissing the reality of what's happening. But meanwhile, we can gain some important perspective when we pause and say, "Okay, how am I, as a conscious being, losing my peace in this? Where does this trigger my own negative self-perception that I think this is proving to me, but actually is not so fundamentally real?" Like, we can allow that to help us find in ourselves where we are wounded, where we have fear, where we have smallness. Yeah. Okay. <br>Then, meanwhile, when we see that out in the world actualizing, it's important not to get the scope size backwards. Like, what I mean is, we tend to look at the Earth, and there it is. Man, it's dense. It's persistent. It's consistent. We've got this political system, which is pretty obviously a tragedy. I mean, I'm not taking a side or anything. I'm just—I mean, it's—I feel like it's pretty obvious that it's a flaw, you know, not the most efficient system we could possibly have. <br>So, as we see that though, it's really okay. So, it'd be like if—and again, I'm not dismissing this—but it'd be like if a few thousand of us sat down and played Minecraft, you know, and then in the Minecraft world, there were some players who had a lot of resources and were kind of picking on everyone else. We might take that really seriously and get fired up. I mean, when my son plays video games downstairs, I hear expressions of great exuberation and frustration and other emotions being shouted throughout the house because of a video game world he's experiencing. <br>So, I'm not making light of it. I'm just being a little playful because it's kind of how we are playing Minecraft right now. And I'm like, "I hope they don't get upset." But as we do that though, like, it's also powerful to take a step back, return to the person being in the seat for a moment before we go back into the Minecraft world, and then do what we can where we are—not just with the people around us, but in consciousness space, like we talked about earlier. And then we're empowered. You see, it's about, like, basically, to put it this way, do you need to lose your peace? Like, what? <br>No. I mean, like, just very, you know, logically, technically, even, is there a reason? Like, is there a reason that you need to—like, how does, you know, is that—um, yeah, yeah. So, the only thing that comes up around that is that the only way to know joy and happiness in this form is to experience the opposite. So, I can't—right? I can't feel happy if I don't know what feeling sad is like.<br>So, the only thing that I can think of around the question you asked is that there a reason for not having peace would be either one, to see what it is that's taking my peace away so I can heal it, or two, to have the contrast. I wasn't—yeah, I wasn't speaking to the ultimate value of duality though. That's what you're pointing at. Got it. The ultimate value of duality as providing a depth into which beingness can fully know itself and its opposites, right? Including joy. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah.<br>More what I meant was, like, let's say that somebody makes—let's say somebody is in a lot of pain, one person, just one person, because, let's say, their father beat them when they were a child. So, they've got some good reason to be in pain, and they've hated themselves ever since because they bought into that self-perception of being worthless and shameful and powerless to stop someone else from harming them. And then, when they grow older, they have a day or a month or even just a moment where they take out that anger on someone else and kill them. <br>And it's a murder. And then the news picks it up, and the news puts the murder on, and now a million people hear about the murder. Now, is it helpful to you or to that person or to the whole if you lose your peace? And I'm not trying to be dry about it. We can—when we're connected with each other, we feel. <br>Compassion is a part of our being. So, I am not saying we're detached from what's happening in others. I'm not saying that. It's just that when that news lifts up that person who hurts someone else, we can see that for what it is—a cry for healing too. And we don't have to lose our peace and think, "Oh man, people are bad. The world's bad." No, no, no. People are afraid. People are hurt. It's like that old phrase, "Hurt people hurt people." I mean, it's cliché, but it's absolutely true. Yeah. Hurt people. And so, as we awaken, we can more deeply see, "Oh, that is my brother or sister who hurts, and they may have hurt another brother or sister who hurts." <br>Do I need to lose my peace when that happens? No. I can feel love for them. I can feel compassion for them. But our being remains what it is. And then we're better able to act in compassion and be there for others around us. I mean, we may feel sorrow. I'm not saying we don't feel sad when we see the hurt in the world.<br>I feel sad, yeah, when I see so much hurt. But on the other hand, it would be a mistake. It would be simply incorrect for me to fall asleep into, "Oh, I now have no power," you see, because this person did something harmful to somebody else because—and because they had good—not good reason, but they had causes. And you see, when we see it from the spiritual perspective in our life reviews after physical life ends, the system has all the data. It sees from every perspective. It records it all. It knows it all. <br>So, when we review our lives, we see it from everyone's perspective, not just our own, because they are us. You see? And then we can see that they chose their choices because they were dealing with challenging things too. Yeah, you know? And that's really what this world of hurt is. It's a challenged, fear-based intentionality running rampant. <br>So, we don't answer that with more fear, you know, with more surrender of power. We don't need to do that. Yeah. I'm not saying we won't hurt. I'm not saying it's not easy. I'm not saying it's easy. I mean, I can't—yeah. I'm just pointing out though that, in the depth of knowing yourself and what that person is, we know that we don't have to lose our peace in the midst of it. And then we retain our power. Sorry, go ahead.  <br>Yeah. What I think I'm hearing too is that when we have our life reviews, there's an element of understanding because we have more than one perspective. It's such ridiculously deep and thorough understanding and unconditional love that we can't—you know, I mean, like, that's what I'm saying is, like, if we look at that person who was hurt and damaged, and they hurt somebody else, we respect them. We love them. Oh my gosh, you went through that, man. It's not saying murder was a great choice. That's not what we're saying. <br>No, no, no, not at all. That's not what we're saying. It's just that, from that perspective—because then the person who operated—I'm just saying that, from his perspective, the murderer now—they will see that they will see their—because they responded to fear. You see, they made a fear-based choice. <br>And we each—not to get down too big of a tangent—but energetically, we are responsible for every single intention, every single thought, every action, every choice. It's all a part of us. You see? Yeah. But it's understood completely that all exists within unconditional love. Oh my gosh, like, this unconditional love cannot be understated. Like, we can't highlight it enough. Like, we could say it a thousand times or put it in the biggest print possible. <br>You—there's no way to possibly articulate the importance and the depth and the power of that unconditional love that exists for us. And that unconditional love is not an unwise or unintelligent or stupid unconditional love. It is a completely seeing, completely knowing, every detail love. Like, no matter with every deepest, darkest detail that you've ever—like, everything you've ever done that was not super—it's all seen, like, completely, even more thoroughly than you've understood it or saw it. And yet, we're unconditionally loved. Yeah.<br><br><br>So, now I want to ask you a couple of things about this. Yeah. Sorry. We—I'm not sure how to ask it, but it's formulating. So, sure. So, it's like, so why is it so hard for us to connect to unconditional love or to understand? Or, I mean, I'm imagining it has something to do with being veiled, but like, what is your perspective on why this can be so challenging for us?  <br>The human experience is like signing up to lift a thousand pounds, and then you're asking, "Why is it heavy?" Well, because it's a thousand pounds, not two. And what I mean by that metaphor is the amount of limitation and obfuscation—veiling—that we've signed up for is extreme. It's extreme. Like, the density of the human experience—and any experience on Earth, but I'm focused on the human experience—is so dense. It's so off-the-charts uniquely dense. <br>And so, like, I heard in—Natalie Sudman, I think it was—she said that the guides on the other side saw us like fighter jet pilots who are flying our jets upside down 20 feet off the ground. Like, what she means is the level of rigor and contrast and density that we are working through is crazy high. And so, in that extreme level of limitation, we often don't see and feel the broader nature because that is the nature of the—this level of density necessitates—okay, this perspective necessitates veiling. Not the level of density itself. <br>The perspective of operating is just the human character means you have to just be the human character. Like, okay. So, but when you're just the human character, guess what that means? You're not the whole. That means you don't feel what everybody else feels. You don't feel the person on the street what they're feeling, and you don't feel connected to the source of all love and joy very much. Like, it's there, but it's deep, deep, deep, deep down, hidden away as a, you know, maybe a quiet voice that pops up every once in a while, and we don't even know what it is. You know? <br>But that's the nature of being so veiled and dealing with this level of density. However, once we actually—like, really process this level of rigor and density—like, really accept it, really accept it, no more rejection of all the pain, of all the body, of all the limitations—oh my gosh, there is this expansion of being that occurs to that place. And then that place is no longer bigger than you, and the fullness of being once again rises up and can be known. So, that joy and that freedom and that amazing environments of being can be known and felt even as we are playing the deep, dense video game of the human condition. Yeah.<br>How do we feel it? How do we connect to that—to the truth of who we are?<br>
Yeah. I'll just mention two things. First, I'll reiterate meditation. I won't restate everything we said, but that's really, really important because, as we let go of thoughts and let go of sense data and let go of everything we're not, and become alert—very alert, very objective alertness—who we already are reveals itself once again. <br>Like, the depths of the silence speak now as we do that. Just as a side comment before we get to the second important point—as we do that, we often find that, when we start looking towards silence, we find ego boundaries and fear. That's okay. Like, if you really look—like, if you really try to stop thinking—like, go—it means you're no longer thinking the ego protective stories either, and it means how you really feel will be rising up. That's okay. Go through it. <br>Don't—like, on the other side of that is the fullness of being. Okay? So, first is go—go look every day, an hour a day, 40 minutes a day—investigate. And the second thing is follow your joy. Follow your passion. Follow that sense of freedom. Follow the authenticity that you know is in there that you feel in your bones. Just do it. Just follow it. Like, basically, when you choose joy and when you wield an intention of love—and whatever that might mean—kindness, compassion, ownership for your crap—and when you fully be yourself—like, all the way, man. Like, just screw all the societal—like, I'm not saying we need to take our roles seriously. <br>That's not what I mean. But just all that conditioning that has been heaped on—drop that. You're—there's no reason you can't be yourself. And when we follow the joy and the freedom that is vibrationally returning to who we really are—see, because what happens is, when we buy into a perception that we're not, we vibrationally plummet down to the vibration of that perception. So, when we feel, "I am powerless now," we vibrate—consciousness, you could say, is vibrating at the level of "I am powerless." And it doesn't feel good. It feels bad. It's not a good feeling. What feels good is our true nature—and the joy and the love and the peace and the freedom of it. <br>So, we can follow with it. We can choose it. We can basically focus on—choose to focus on the love and the peace and the joy and the authenticity in whatever way we personally, intuitively feel called to do it. And that's unique for every person. Like, every one of us has our own—our own nature is unique for every one of us. And that's beautiful. So, what is your nature calling you to be or to do or to say or to not do or to not eat? Whatever it is, you know? Like, what is your—like, the actual nature, not the little voice that's like, "Oh, you're not going to be worthy unless you do something." I'm talking about the joy, man. You got to listen. <br>You got to listen true. Listen true for that real, authentic you and just follow it. It doesn't have to be a big thing either. It can be like a small thing. It may—maybe it's not even an action. Maybe it's how you sit with yourself right now in silence. Maybe you do feel called to take an action. Maybe you want to go for a walk. Maybe you want to quit your job and go do something completely different. Like, it could be big. I'm just saying, we—because as we begin to say yes to our excitement and to our joy, that's like saying yes to the soul that I'm—I'm from the human personality level—like, I'm listening now. And then we get—and then we get more of it. Yeah.<br><br><br>I'm so passionate about authenticity. It's outside of this podcast. I'm a coach, and I facilitate workshops that help people understand who they are and practice being authentic. And I just interviewed you—a great example of it, by the way. Thank you. To overcome some crap, and you're doing it, and that's awesome. And that was the path—the path to overcoming my addictions, the path to overcoming bad relationships or toxicity was to start being myself. <br>And I'm still learning how to be myself. I know. It's amazing how not easy that can be sometimes, right? How easy can it be to not be yourself? Or how—in a situation, I might notice, like, "Wow, I just said yes even though I meant no." Yeah, yeah. And it's like, still, even though I've been practicing this, but a woman just—that I had just interviewed—she had said that, and she was a course student too. She was teaching EFT tapping, and what she had said was her perspective was that, you know, the body hosts the soul, and when we release that tension, our soul now has the freedom to express itself as it wants to. <br>And I just—I love everything about authenticity. And I'm curious what else you might have to add around authenticity in addition to what you just said because I do believe that our conditioning causes us to be inauthentic, and sometimes we don't even know it. <br>Yeah. The primary reason that we're inauthentic is fear. We do get conditioned to be inauthentic just because of what we've been taught and the path we've worn in the grass. But the most common reason is fear because ego doesn't want us to be judged or, you know, seen as—like, the ego says, "Well, if you don't say this thing, they're going to view you in this way, and then that'll prove to you that you really are worthless." Yeah, you know, because we really do feel some negative self-perception down there, and we're afraid that the other person or the situation is going to prove it to us. You know, as an example, just one example. <br>So, like, basically, if we become fearless about facing our own fear, what external person or thing can make you be inauthentic? Nothing. Like, what I mean is, like, it's your own fear that is the only thing that you're quote-unquote striving against. Like, you don't even need to strive against it. It's not based on anything real. But it's hard when you're doing it, right? So, when we actually face our own crap and own—like, "Wow, I really feel powerless. I feel victimized. I feel like a victim. I have been—I have that has been proven to me by this relationship and this abuse and this accident or whatever." You know, go into the rejection deep in the body. You know, feel like, where am I holding on to that? Face it. Process it. Heal it. Allow it. Allow it to just—like, let go. <br>Own how you felt and honor yourself enough—oh my God—honor yourself enough to know, "I feel this way." Like, maybe you're sick, and you're not okay with being sick. It's okay if you're sick. It's okay. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to prove yourself. You don't have to do it. You don't—like, you only think that because you bought into the—now, I—I'm—this is a complex thing we're talking about because this conversation about personally dealing with fear and overcoming it is so unique for every person, and it's so multifaceted. It's so complex. <br>I mean, we might live an entire lifetime kind of examining, working through one aspect of it, right? So, this is a humongous topic. But I'm just pointing that out in relation to your comment about authenticity because, if you find yourself pulled in an inauthentic direction, okay, that's okay. Go—where's the fear? Like, and it's okay that you're afraid. And then you can just very consciously, you know, "I'm afraid, but I'm going to be myself and say the real thing." You know?<br>And I happen to work in an environment where there's not always authenticity in my professional life. I've basically decided I'm going to be authentic no matter what happens—while respecting, of course, the culture and, you know, doing a good job and all that. Yeah, of course. But I'm not going to not be me. You know, like, I'm just—I just—I know that I'm not human.<br>I know that we are here for a limited amount of time. I am not—I mean, it's—I'm not fooled by the great structures of man. Like, I'm just not. Like, they're not—that's not the power. The power is who we really are. Like, we resonate. We shine bright as a spirit when we just be ourselves. Okay? And then—one second comment to that question because it's so good. <br>Okay, this is so important. Oh my gosh, this is so, so, so important. I wish that every single person on the entire Earth could feel and hear this. You are absolutely worthy of being yourself because the real you is so valuable and so unique and so precious that I can't even articulate it. Like, the whole—how do I put this? Like, there's no good language for this. Each one of us is like a puzzle piece of creation, and you are the only puzzle piece of your color. You really are. It doesn't matter if you haven't made money. It doesn't matter if you can't do something physical. It doesn't matter if you've had this back. It's okay that you've had the pain and the history and the trauma. <br>You are a valuable puzzle piece that, when you see from the perspective of God, it's like you are unconditionally loved—not as a generic unconditional love, but as a very personal, specific-to-you, you are celebrated for exactly who you are. Love. You are celebrated. There is a celebrative—is that a word?—celebratory element to the love of spirit. And actually, I felt this at the IONS conference last year, and I'm so glad I'm going to see you this year in Phoenix. It's going to be awesome. <br>I'm so excited to be there. It's going to be awesome. So, in DC last year, I can only describe it like a party where everybody was celebrating everyone else for who they are. So, I'm lifting that up because that is a major block to authenticity when we think, "Well, like, I really am not that important. I'm really not. I'm really just a victim. I'm really small. I'm really powerless. I'm—or I'm really not valuable." No, no, no. Don't believe that. Like, that is not true. <br>Like, when you look at yourself from the spiritual lens, you will not believe the absolute unique beauty that you are. Like, every soul is so unique, uniquely, preciously themselves—their own color, their own mix, their own—I don't know how to describe it. It'd be like—like, a metaphor I've used before is, like, one soul might be like a grapevine, and another soul might be like an oak tree. <br>And the grapevine might say, "Oh, I'm—this is a crude metaphor, but I'm not big and tall and strong like this other person." No, you are a grapevine. You produce sweet grapes, and it's freaking awesome, and you're the only grapevine there is. <br>So, just like—you know what I mean? Like, we have to recognize the incredible value that we each individually have. And then, when we do that, we feel free to be ourselves because, "Oh, well, wait, so what I have to share is actually valuable." Yes, yes, it is. Like, your own self, your own skills, your own quality of being—it doesn't even have to be a skill. Maybe you say, "I don't have skills." Okay, fine. Like, you could still be yourself. Maybe the only thing you can do—maybe you're bedridden. The only thing you can do today is look at the light. Look at the light in your way. Be present. It's just a big illusion anyway. It's fine. You can choose how to be the most you because you're worthy to do that because that's what—gosh, that's what we are. <br>That's what we're here to do, man. We're here to break those binds and to be our authentic selves, even if crap happens. I mean, like, when I first went through my awakening process, it caused some social friction around me. You know, I didn't mean to. I wasn't trying to cause a problem. But, you know, it's amazing if you wake up one day and say, "Wow, we are unconditionally loved, multi-dimensional beings of freedom and joy, and you have nothing to fear." How many people get angry, right? Because of beliefs. That's okay. That's okay. I'm—we have—but it's fine because, as we choose it, we become empowered, and we can empower others, and we can share the love, which is what we're doing right now. Like, this is sharing that love, man. <br>Like, even if only one person hears this and is lifted up and has that resonance and feels strengthened, then we've done it. Yes. And then, you know what I mean? Like, that's what this is all about. Yes. Like, hopelessness is the lie. Back to the original point, it's the—it's not even the thing. Like, when we look from the other side at the reality of it, it's like, "Oh my gosh, we never had any reason to actually be that afraid." I—so, so, guess what, guys? Oh my gosh, we're here right now. Like, we are human right now. And I know that you might not think this is a big, special, important day. It's like, you know, like a Thursday, you know, random day of the week. Okay? But this is the critical, valuable moment right now. <br>Like, just to be yourself and to choose love and joy and peace in whatever way you can—that's what we're here to do. This is the moment. Oh my gosh, I'm so passionate about it because—yeah, I love it. I love the passion. I'm over here just all—you know, fired up. I can feel my heart open. <br>And what I want to say in addition to what you said was that, when I started my journey, it was kind of—you know, I went through a journey of addiction. And as I started to recover from one addiction, I started to learn that I could be myself. And then, deeper and deeper, I started to realize that the only reason I wasn't authentic was because I was afraid of not being loved—that someone would judge me. Yes. And, you know, but the cost of not being authentic was that I wasn't happy. Yeah. Being inauthentic is not living in alignment, so we don't get to experience the joy out of that. Yeah. And so, as I went through my journey—and even still, there's times where, you know, conditioning says, as a mom, you should XYZ, right? <br>So, sometimes I go along with it, and I feel, "Oh, that didn't feel good," because I was being inauthentic. But, yeah, the fear of not being loved, I think, is what is the—it's huge. And, like, when you were talking about how we're all, you know, our own color—like, yes. I had this meditation a couple of months ago, and what I saw in this meditation was, like, each of us are, you know, kind of weaving our own little square, and it all fits into this one quilt. And it was so beautiful. It was like, around the world, it was glowing. You know, like, this was just a vision I had, but, you know, I felt like textures and sounds and, you know, like, what you were saying just kind of popped to life—like, we are valuable. Yeah. It very much is like that. What we're naturally contributing is what we're here to do. And that's my question for you is, yeah, is that what we're here to do? Is that why we come here?  <br>I mean, in simple terms, yes. Like, there's an—so, one of the essays in my book is called "Your Soul's Job." And I was just being silly, but the job is an acronym for "Joy of Being," which is another way of saying the real you. The only thing you have to do is be you. Yeah. You don't have to do anything else. You don't—you can't fail. Right? Like, when you truly embrace that and know that, how freeing is that? <br>And then, from that, you can be yourself. Now, I will say, of course, just practically speaking, that many people—or, you know, when we have deep ego—when we say, "Be yourself and, you know, follow your passion," you know, if we have a lot of fear, the ego might take that as an excuse to go do something harmful. That's not what I'm talking about, of course. I just—to disclaimer, we're not talking about that. <br>No, we're talking about the real, loving, compassionate you that even owns your own crap and does your very best and is authentic but knows, at the same time, that nothing is required of you, and you can't fail. Like, you only—like, joy is what you're here to be. Joy—not like scratch-the-itch, feel-good ego stuff necessarily, right? That's just—that happens, but that's not what I'm talking about. Joy. You might say, "I've never had joy in my whole life." Okay, that's okay. Start there. "I've never had joy my whole life." Fine. Acknowledge it. Yeah. I applaud your bravery, you know what I mean? Like, you need to honor yourself. This is where I am. Why not? Like, and for each person, it will be its own answer, its own story. Like, you had to be brave enough. You see, you have to be brave. You had to be brave enough to say, "You know what? I actually was inauthentic because I was afraid of not being loved." Do you know how much bravery that takes? <br>Because that takes you looking at the pain of not being loved and acknowledging that you don't feel loved or that you were afraid of not being loved. That takes a lot of courage. This is a courageous, very humbling process we're talking about here at times, but that's okay. See, that's the quality of intention. That's why—that's why I lift up so much that we're here to wield a quality of intention that is in alignment with love and not fear—not self-protection, not rejection. Love. Like, that means looking and being you—looking at what you actually feel. And that can be hard. <br>Yeah. But, yeah, you're worthy. You're worthy to do that. Oh my gosh. Yeah, you are worthy to do it, and it is very hard. Like, it took a long time. I was 28 when I went to treatment for an eating disorder, and I was 34 when I got sober. So, okay, most of my life, I wasn't—it wasn't even that I wasn't willing. It was I actually just didn't know where to look. Yeah, sure. I think you said in the beginning, it's ignorance, right? Ignorance. You just don't know—not in a judgmental way. No, not in a judgmental way. We just don't know.<br>We just can't see. True. And, you know, what did it for me was that there was a point where I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. Yeah. And the pain had to become so big that I was no longer willing to—so, yeah. So, just—yeah, a point there, like, so that's often how it works. Yeah. And that's okay because what happens is—so, fear—okay, we choose what we choose because we think it's the better option. Yes, right? And then we get—and then we have—so, then we're avoiding fear. We're avoiding the pain. We're avoiding the negative self-perception for so long that we become miserable. We become sick and tired. We—our lives become hellish. <br>But we think that's preferable. Right? Eventually, enough pressure amounts that you say, "You know what? I had a moment like this. I had a moment maybe probably 10 years ago. I mean, I've had—I'm here to process, so I've had a lot of fear in my journey. That's okay. A lot of fear. <br>And there was a moment I was in my kitchen. I was making a pronouncement to my beautiful wife in tears—like, the deepest tears—and I said, 'I am effing sick of being afraid.' And this was during my awakening because I had started awakening, but, you know, these things happen in layers. Like, it takes a while to get down to the really nitty-gritty, ooey-gooey pain in the middle, right? But when you're really—like, so what I'm saying is, like, to your comment, sometimes that tension—that hell juice—needs to build up before we have enough pressure that we go, 'You know what? I'm going to go in there and face that.' And I've used a simple metaphor before, but I think it's a good metaphor. When my father was a child, he was afraid of the monsters in his closet. <br>And he was afraid every night, and he lost sleep every night. Every night, he couldn't go to sleep. He'd lay there. He couldn't sleep. He was so afraid of those monsters. They're going to come out and eat him. For months. And then, eventually, he said, 'You know what? I would rather get eaten by those monsters than have this fear anymore.' And he went into that closet, pushed his way through the clothes, sat on the floor, completely ready to be eaten by the monsters. And they did not eat him because there were no monsters. Our fear is very much like that. We avoid it our whole lives. We avoid our shame. We avoid our need for love that hasn't been met. We avoid it our whole lives. <br>And then, when we finally have had enough, we go into that closet, and we face it, and we feel it, and we find there were no monsters. There was nothing to be afraid of. But it requires the willingness to go into the closet first, whatever that means for you. And the angels are with us when we do that. I'm telling you, that's the real work. When we say, 'I've had enough of this crap,' and we go, and we go into the closet, and we really face that darkness and that pain in there—powerlessness, whatever it is—we feel it. We allow it. We don't reject it. It heals—not because we tried to get rid of it. We didn't try to get rid of it. In fact, we did the opposite of trying to get rid of it. We went into it. And it heals. And then—and that's how we process it. You see?<br><br><br>I have heard you share that. I think I heard you shared that on the last episode that we did, and it just reminds me of something that my first sponsor told me. She was one of my course teachers, and she said, "You know, go to the edge of fear to see that it isn't real." And something actually came in as you were explaining that story this time that didn't come in last time, which was that "sick and tired of being sick and tired." Yeah. I'm curious, like, what your perspective is on that. Like, is that our true power just coming through, saying, like, "Screw that. Like, I'm not going to be debilitated by this"? Like, it just felt like that was our nature that says, "We don't need to be afraid. That the true self somewhere is like, 'Uh-uh, we're not going to be limited by this fear that actually isn't even necessary to be afraid of.'"  <br>It's a personal shift in intention is what it is—towards the true power, which is love and acceptance. See, fear is actually powerless. Ego is powerless. Like, it doesn't actually do anything. The real power comes from the love and the joy of spirit. It's what we are. So, when we shift our intention in that moment—you know, it might—the physical expression, maybe even the human personality, egoic expression might be, "Screw this. I'm going to go in and face the fear." But what we're talking about is the intention behind it—the why that we're making the choice. The turning around and the going into the closet is an intention. You know? <br>And so, a lot of people want to hear, like, "Oh, I want to reject my circumstance. So, teach me the new spiritual thing I can do to get rid of it." It doesn't matter what form you use. I don't care if you call it spiritual or not. If you're trying to avoid it, that's your intention, right? If you're trying to reject it, then that's your intention. You see, we're talking about the actual loving yourself so deeply that you actually feel what's down there. That is a quality of intention shift towards the power of what we really are. That's the way I'd respond to your question.<br>
Thank you. <br><br><br>So, I was meditating before our conversation today, and I felt a nudge that there needs to be a focus on the idea of the teaching nature of the vast silence itself because the form-focused personality is always looking in form for the answers. "Tell me the next thing. Give me the next book. What's the next stimulation? Show me the next movie. Show me the next NDE video." I'm not making—like, I mean, it's fine. I applaud people who watch NDE videos, but I'm just saying, like, whatever we can grab onto, we try to grab the next thing. <br>Whereas there is this tremendous resource sitting there all the time that is waiting to, in the most positive way possible, destroy us. I'm saying that carefully. What I mean is, when we are willing to be broken in the most healthy, beautiful way and let go of all the ego patterns and distractions and form focuses and just be in silence—the silence. When I say the silence, I don't just mean audio silence, audible silence. It doesn't actually have to be audible silence. I'm talking about the silence of the mind, the silence of being where we are now. <br>And I recognize that it's not pragmatic for many people who have not meditated very much to let go of thinking into silence, but it doesn't matter. It's okay. Wherever you are, it's totally fine. You are right next to the silence right now. You're not far away from it. Like, you're not. So, we can always basically put down all of our bags and bring all of our focus into the present moment and let the deep silence show us where we are unhealed and let it dissolve the mechanisms—the mechanical nature of the human personality and its processes that seem so important. It's the only way I can put this sensation that I felt was helpful to share. <br>Like, you know, we—I do a lot of talking. You know, I'm on podcasts. I don't feel the need to talk. I don't even really want to talk. But talking is how we've got here. What's more important than the talking—far more important—is the silence within us all that is waiting for you to go to it and see it and look at it. You know, that's the power. That's far more powerful than what any human can jabber with some words or what can be written in a book. So, I just—I felt like that should be mentioned.  <br>Yeah. Well, I'm really grateful that you shared that. I know that I can be someone who is looking externally for the next book or the next video or, you know, and the truth is, like, as I've studied A Course in Miracles, there is a chapter that's called "Rules for Decision," and it's really bringing you back to that place of going inside and asking, "What's next?" and going so deep inside yourself that you actually hear what it is that's not coming from an external source that says, "You need to do this practice, or you need to do this meditation, or read this book, or go to this seminar, or watch this podcast." See, and it's okay that we have those thoughts and that we do those actions. That's totally okay. This is not a judgment of that at all. And it's not like, "Okay, see, this is tricky." We're talking about something tricky because now we're pointing at non-duality from within duality. Okay? <br>So, here we are, the duality-focused, form-focused being, pointing at that which transcends form. And it gets tricky to do that within duality because we don't have it. That's not how duality is. Duality is, by definition, form. Okay? But if you take the time—this is about using your intention—take the time, notice, "Oh, I feel like I need to meditate. I'm supposed to meditate." Notice that thought. You can even—like, the intuition in your body and mind both will help lift up the next step towards silence—towards, okay, let's not call it even silence at this moment—the next step towards complete ease and no freedom, peace. <br>I find that, at the human level, something that has been challenging for me personally is that, having touched that space, it is more beautiful and full of joy than any form we could throw around. And so, if I go to a social gathering—like, maybe with my family or something—you know, there's a lot of talking. I would love to sit in silence and share that with someone because, when we both put down the stuff, the beauty of connection between any two of us—like, we are all family. <br>Every single one of us. If we just put aside our crap and be vulnerable and present and authentic with each other—even in silence, it could be words. Words are fine too. Actions are okay too. Silence is okay too. As we share that space together, oh my gosh, the joy—like, the connectedness that we know with each other is so joyful. It's deeper than any shallow conversation thing we might banter about. I mean, I will participate in banter if that's what's happening. I will banter. <br>I do a lot of that in my professional life. Banter occurs. You know? But it's okay that we choose something beyond that. One of the greatest blessings of sharing in this way has been that I have been able to meet other people who are awake, and the beauty of those relationships is amazing. And silence is okay there, and talking is okay there, and just being ourselves is okay there. It doesn't matter how old we each are, what sex we each are—you're that's not what we are anyway. We can just be present. Like, it's about a presence more than some action. <br>hat's a simple way to put that. That's—anyway, it's kind of a tangent, but—<br>
No, it's beautiful. It's actually—and I'm not going to talk too much about this because I know we need to wrap up, but the workshops that I do—they're called "The Mystic's Playground," and it's a three-day workshop where we mix games and just being—beautiful to pull out love, allow ourselves to be authentic, and actually connect.<br>
Yes, that's awesome. You're doing it. Yes. <br><br><br>So, the last time I interviewed you, I asked you three questions, and I just spontaneously had this idea to just ask you one since you've already answered the three. So, I was just recently on a podcast, and I was asked this question, and I want to know what you would have to say. So, if there was one question that you wanted to ask anyone who's listening right now, what would that one question be?  <br>Why can't you be yourself? Like, really go look. Really investigate it. Not playful. Give me the—I mean, you give me an—if you're honest, you'll give me the ego story that why you think you can't be yourself. I'm talking about deeper than that. Really. No. Really. No. Really. And I think that's kind of the theme of what we talked about. Why? Yeah. Why can't you be yourself? Your real self is a multi-dimensional being of love and joy. You really are. Like, we are just playing the human characters. It's really deep. It's really visceral. I get it. Oh my gosh, I'm here too. But no, you really do transcend the physical. It's a real thing. It's not a woo-woo thing. It's not a religious thing. It's just the physics. That's the thing. That's what's real. Your consciousness itself does transcend this. Yeah. Find the freedom in that when you ask yourself, "Why can't I be me?" Yeah. That's juicy. Thank you.  <br>And Christian, how do people find you if they want to get in touch with you?<br>
Sure. My website is awalkinthephysical.com. The book is A Walk in the Physical. It's available for free at the third link down on the book page to be read online. It's not about money. I just want to share the message and share the love. And there's a bunch of talks and interviews there. I'm sure I'll be posting this one. This is wonderful. Yeah, that's probably the best way to reach me. Or come to Phoenix. Come to Phoenix in the end of August, and you and I will both be there. It'll be so fun. Oh my gosh, I'm bringing my family—my wife and my kids—that Saturday afternoon, and it's going to be fun. If anybody's near Phoenix, yes, the end of August, the IONS conference. <br>So, yes, I'm so excited to see you in person, to meet everybody that I've interviewed and others that I'm going to interview, and just be in that energy of celebrating each and every person for who they are. And I just want to say thank you so much, Christian, for joining me today. Thank you for being my first episode of this podcast ever. Thank you. And again, here now, a little bit over a year later, thank you for sharing your heart and your soul, for getting your words out in your book, and just being everywhere and talking—speaking, talking. Yes, talking. And using language to the best of your ability to help us understand. I'll say—I'll make one comment there. <br>I so it's not just talking, of course. I mean, I say that playfully because there's something else that we're doing, and that is energetic. The words are just a surface thing. Yeah. What's happening in consciousness and in energy space is powerful, and you are participating in that. And that is the coolest thing we can do on Earth right now. So, thank you. And it's an honor. It's awesome. This is the real work. This is the thing. When we're done later, we look back—this is the real work. You know, it's not the money and the objects and the—no. If we can be there for each other and just be authentic and encourage one another as other parts of the self to be themselves, then that is it. <br>I agree 100%. Thank you so much.  <br>You're welcome. It's been an honor.  <br>I would like to personally thank you for tuning in to this episode.

 <br><br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZAoLImp47U" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZAoLImp47U</a>  <br>10 NOV 2024 <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@InspiredEvolution" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@InspiredEvolution" target="_blank">Amrit Sandhu</a><br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Physical reality is like a bright point of light that you just never look away from, but you can. I've experienced that. I had some pre-birth memory as a very young child, and I assumed other people would just know that we weren't from here, but they didn't. I didn't want to forget all the way, but I knew that even having a little bit of memory would actually make this life more challenging.  <br>I remember sailing through the galaxies and being in awe at their beauty and being so excited to participate, and being like, "Wow, we get to be these things!" It wasn't just humans; it was anything we wanted in the universe. In higher states, you can tangibly feel and know that you are a part of all, and the bliss of that is unspeakably amazing.  <br>I was aware pre-life that this universe is like the most extreme when it comes to the experience of separation, and that is a very alien constraint. It's not about masochism or experiencing extreme limitation. We grow in extreme ways. The physical is a simulation anyway, but what's not a simulation is consciousness itself and the quality of intent that it refines, and we get to keep that.  <br><br><br>The Akashic records—we can go into that and pull out information and say, "Well, what if I would have made this choice?" Here's the thing, though—this is really important. I had some pre-birth memory as a very young child, and I assumed other people would just know that we weren't from here, but they didn't. They didn't talk about it, and then that memory left me completely by the age of like five or six.  <br>But my body was 30 years old when I took up a long-term meditation practice, and after a few months, I started to have non-physical experiences—so very real, extremely eye-opening out-of-body experiences—and the pre-birth memory just kind of arrived at the same time. It wasn't like a big epiphany; it was actually like the more normal thing.  <br>And yeah, I mean, I'm aware, of course, that here on Earth, we're veiled, so we don't commonly remember that. That's like part of the game, but it does seem strange to me that we don't remember, you know, having seen and known that. It is a bit strange. It's like walking around on the stage of a play, perhaps, you know, and the characters don't remember they're just in a play.  <br>Interviewer: Was it quite disconcerting recognizing that other people don't remember what you remember? Like, how did you arrange yourself in a situation? Life?  <br>Christian Sundberg: No, I don't think it was disconcerting. The more disconcerting part is simply the vibrational distance between our true nature, which, you know, is hugely connected and full of love and peace and joy and freedom, you know, and when you touch that, oh, it's amazing versus the kind of the average vibration on Earth. It's comparatively very low.  <br><br><br>So I think that is the more stark challenge, at least it was for me, that when I was getting in touch with that and having those experiences, Earth is like such a different vibrational place, you know, to experience day-to-day. That was the challenging part for me.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, it's really interesting because, following your work, it seems like where we go from this very infinite space to a very electively chosen finite experience. Let's talk about the vibrations for a sec. Like, is Earth the densest place, or is it just what? It is high density. Like, how would you describe it relative to...  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so this is really hard to talk about. I'll just quickly disclaim before we get into this that language just does not do any of this service. Like, I have to just say that up front because you can't really effectively use earthly language. It's just not possible. You know, language is form, symbols, and our true nature fully transcends all of the context of Earth, all the symbols. It transcends linear time and discrete location, you know, these things that we take for granted. So I just have to say that, you know, first.  <br><br><br>Yeah, so the vibration—we could simply say that our true nature is completely connected to the whole. And our... okay, so when we say vibration, what are we talking about? It's a vibration of consciousness itself, beingness itself. Okay, so in higher states, you can tangibly feel and know—not just understand but like know—that you are a part of all. You're individuated, but you're also connected to all, and the bliss of that is unspeakably amazing versus the Earth experience, which, yes, is extremely limiting, extremely constraining, extremely dense.  <br>Not bad—it's not inherently bad—it's just extremely limiting. The constraints are very high. I was aware pre-life that this universe is like the highest degree of... in the... okay, so every universe, every reality type, has its own like build or intention, and we can at least say that ours, our universe, is like the most extreme when it comes to the experience of separation.  <br>So like, you can't get more separate than what we experience on Earth, and that is a very alien constraint. It's not standard; it's not typical for the spirit to not tangibly know its connectedness to everyone else and to all things. So adopting that sense of separation, that limitation, that obscuring of your knowing—you know, we call that the veil—that's integral to the game, and that is an extreme limitation set that, yes, is, you know, the most dense in the direction of separation.  <br>Interviewer: Yes, it begs the question—I know this is like, "What is the purpose of life?"—but why? Why the separation? In your opinion, like, why do we come down here to experience this separated thing? Because I think also just in that, like, would love to point to because you also made a choice. You remember making the choice to come down, and there was actually like, you were inspired at a certain point—inspired evolution.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: What we're doing here—inspired evolution. You got it. If you can speak to that, like, you were inspired, and then you made a choice, and then... yeah, again, words are very difficult here, but in short, what we're doing is participating in the expansion of love and joy—the expansion of our being through the integration of experience.  <br>And what kind of experience are we integrating? A high-constraint experience. So duality itself—this whole system of ups and downs, left and right, hot and cold, birth and death, you know, linear time—that whole system is subsequent. It's not primary, but it exists to create something. Like, this is just a metaphor, but like a cave carves out a cave into which beingness can then fill and know.  <br>So through experiencing extreme limitation, we grow in extreme ways. When we integrate that experience—it's not automatic, actually, but it does happen—because we, as consciousness, are like experience integrators. So we come to have the experience of being human and to actually experience that perspective and then come to terms with it, integrate it, really, really process it, and to see if we can wield an intention that is in alignment with our true nature through our choice-making.  <br>That means an intention that is love-based—love, freedom, joy, and peace—an intention that's in alignment with that rather than the intention of fear, which means the ego and all the shenanigans that arise out of ego. If we can choose that even in these constraints, oh my gosh, then that true nature is deeply refined—is the only verb I can think of—and that is an incredible opportunity, even though the constraints are so high.  <br>I am very, very passionate about lifting up the human experience as such an opportunity. Like, and I know it sounds crazy, you know, because like, I signed up, and I experienced a very challenging personal trauma in my 20s. I've had chronic illness on and off my whole life. I've gone through a lot of trauma, but the thing is, oh my gosh, the opportunity to meet that, to process it, to heal it, to really get into the nitty-gritty, you know, and oh my gosh, it's like winning the lottery.  <br>Like, being given a human life is like winning the lottery. I mean, I felt like I had been given a winning lottery ticket worth a million dollars. That's how it felt to be given the chance to play a human.  <br>Interviewer: What do you think it was? How come you remember part of your pre-life stuff, but other people don't?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so first of all, I'm not special. You know, people tend to think, "Well, that person is unique; that's special." Okay, well, for two things: First of all, in my pre-birth planning, I did ask to have a small, tiny amount of memory, and I did when I was young, but like I said, I forgot it because I didn't want to forget all the way, but I knew that even having a little bit of memory would actually make this life more challenging.  <br>Like, the contrast would be even higher, having that awareness, so harder to remember than it would be not to. There's this veil of forgetting.  <br>Interviewer: Sorry, I'm interrupting.  <br>Christian Sundberg: No, exactly. No, please. It's really interesting. It's like it prevents homesickness, actually. So like, near-death experiencers often describe how they feel just so homesick. They just want to go back to the other side because it's so amazing.  <br>It's what we seek—that wholeness—all the time here. So to know of it consciously, it prompts so much homesickness. It's something I deal with every day with that lens.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Again, I know I'm back in that space with you where it's like it's so difficult to put words to all of this.  <br>Christian Sundberg: I know, I know.  <br>Interviewer: Sure, and it's not, but you do such an amazing job, so thank you. But it's really interesting, even just watching society at large, how much we are running to actually try and fulfill these voids that we innately feel deep within ourselves.  <br>It's to reflect the entire construct in so many ways is looking for synthetic fillings.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, it's not the whole construct; it's just our state of evolution within this level of constraint. So it's a little bit like saying if you lay down on a weight bench and lift, let's say, I don't know, 300 lbs, it's heavy, but that's not to say that it can't be done.  <br>You know, those who are strong can lift 300 lbs no problem. So I'm just putting it that way because it's not that the construct itself is innately charged or necessitates egoic patterning. It's just that where we have fear, ego will make egoic choices as we try to fill that hole and grasp at straws.  <br><br><br>And there's a lot of fear. Fear just means yet unevolvedness. It's not a fundamental thing; it's not even based in anything real. It's based in a perception that's not even in alignment with the truth. Okay, but we don't know that. We see a world where we think, "Oh, I could be killed," or "I have no power," or "I'm not worthy of love." You know, we buy into these perceptions really deep down, and then the ego is just the part of us that's going, "Gosh, I need to try to fix that. I'll believe in this and feel better, or I'll secure this object or this money and feel better, or I'll do this drug and feel better," you know, whatever.  <br>That's just kind of what the ego does in response to the fear. So, it's really just that we have fear. I'm not making light of it—the only hard thing. But yeah, the interesting thing at this particular juncture is that people might start to feel like, "Oh, is this an invitation to being empathetic to the whole thing to some degree?"  <br>Interviewer: No, no. Yeah, I'd love for you to clarify that.  <br>Christian Sundberg: No, no. Okay, so this life is extremely meaningful. Okay, so let me put it this way: What we truly are is consciousness itself, spirit itself, beingness itself, life itself, and life itself is extremely meaningful. Okay, so then, within life itself, within consciousness itself, this world of form has arisen. We're creating this system.  <br>So the way that we interact with each other here and the way that we express and actualize our true nature is very important. Like, it's so meaningful to bring love into this place and to shine love to each other here versus choosing fear and ego, which is empty and painful. It's very meaningful to align with life, which is of meaning already.  <br>So this is a very meaningful experience, even though the physical world, we could say, is like an illusion. You could say that, but it's a real experience we're having here. You know, and in that, oh my gosh, there's so much potential for meaning, and there is just so much meaning fabric woven into the wall of being—woven into the tapestry of life.  <br>Interviewer: Really interesting because you've used the word "true nature" in both spaces, though. Like, we're here on Earth to discover more about true nature, but then also our true nature is ever-present. Um, and I don't want to make it sound like here and there, and maybe you can help clarify that a little bit as well. I'm sure it's not... yeah, there's only one thing.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, but do you get what I mean? Like, the engineer in me is like, you know, our true nature, and then we come here to explore our true nature. It's like, aren't we already connected to our true nature? So what are we doing here? Question. There is... okay, so there's only one fundamentally real thing. Okay, so first of all, speaking to the engineering nature, I resonate.  <br><br><br>I worked in nuclear for 20 years—nuclear valve pump manufacturing, project management. I'm also interested in trying to articulate this within duality and to appeal to logic. I'm a logical person; that's very... I'm very passionate about that. Okay, so but let's look at this though because the substance of what is fundamentally real is... we can call that consciousness itself.  <br>So when I say our true nature, we are always that true nature. You can't actually be something else.  <br>Interviewer: Hey there, inspired soul! Thank you so much to all of you that have taken the time to subscribe to the channel.

Thank you so much.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Back to Christian: There is only one thing. The one thing that is, is beingness itself, consciousness itself, life itself. That is the one thing that is fundamentally real. Okay, so that one thing doesn't actually need to do anything. It's not required to incarnate; it doesn't need to self-limit. But if we can choose to be something that we're not, you see, then in doing that, we add to what we truly are because we've deepened what is possible through manifest creation and deepen what we can know and what we can feel and what we can be.  <br>You see, like, how can you know something without knowing its opposite? How can you truly know what it is to be all if you have an experience being not all? You see, so there's an additive element to what duality offers, and we voluntarily choose to engage that because we see the product, the outcome. You could say—I mean, I don't like making it sound too dry, like transactional—this is not a transactional thing. This is an expansion of being by being something.  <br>And we were discussing long before this life, you met a being of joy and power who inspired you to actually incarnate. Who was this being, and how did that encounter influence your decision to experience physicality?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Well, I can't say who he was as if he had a human name or something, but I can say that I knew that this being had had physical experiences, and he shared with me those experiences.  <br>And I telepathically felt the incredible quality of his nature, his essence. It was, oh my gosh, it was amazing. And I mean, I really need to stress this though because the potential refinement that's available to us through such huge limitation is off the charts, and I could see that, and I was super inspired by that. You know, I was like, "Wow, I really, I really want to do that."  <br>So I don't know who he was, and it's not like Earth is the only place to incarnate. You know, in fact, I hadn't even been physical at that point in my journey, so I didn't even understand what it meant really. I mean, he showed me, but you don't really know unless you've done it. So yeah, I can't possibly speak to who that being was as if there was an identity I could put a name on in human terms.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, it's really interesting hearing you talk about communication. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what his communication, from what you remember, is like in that space relative to how we communicate here?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Well, here on Earth, we have to like throw sound at each other because we're separate. So right, we experience separation. We're not actually separate, but we experience separation, so we have to like throw words at the other person.  <br>They have to hear the words and compare them against their own memory, and then there's meaning in that. It's very crude, very slow. In higher systems, communication is naturally done telepathically, and that's quite normal and natural because the other person is a part of you. Like, you are individuated; you're still yourselves. You're not like, you know, not you. You are you; you're even more you, in fact, but that you that you are knows that it's connected to them.  <br>And so there's not like a barrier; there's no separation to work with, so the sharing is very complete and full and very full of feeling and knowledge and like language-type communication, but it's everything at once. It's very, very thorough and complete, and that's like the natural way of communicating.  <br>Interviewer: It's really interesting because, I imagine, even if we're communicating in the higher systems, then there is some sense of self or other, but there is... it's like you're describing it's you're a one, and so that... but it's so difficult to wrap your human 3D mind that's so individuated around oneness and still connecting. Are there like... does that... the human mind naturally wants to sort of... are there like dimensions even higher where everything is collectively one?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Okay, so oneness and individuation are not mutually exclusive. Let's just first make sure that's clear because, you know, it's not like you have to be only you and not the whole or the whole and not you. They're simultaneous, but what does happen is we may go to one end of the spectrum or the other experientially. You know, so you may return to a more experiential state of complete oneness, or you may dive in the other direction where we are now, where you experience a state of apparently complete separation, and you don't feel connected at all almost.  <br>You know, so yes, there are higher systems. Well, in fact, it's the more normal state of being where we know our connectedness. You know, it's tangibly felt and known, and that's a beautiful thing.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: Yeah, what's it like when you're making the choice to come down here? Is it like you're super excited to play a video game, or is it like taking quite a bit of courage because you just alluded that there's a significant amount of contrast, but you also mentioned opportunity? So yeah, what's... what is it? Is it unique to each individual?  <br>Christian Sundberg: What's it like? It's unique to each individual. Every soul is unique, so the way that we interact with form is unique. But yes, the... I mean, for me, I can at least say that in my pre-birth experience, the primary feeling was incredible excitement, even though I knew that this experience might totally crush me and it would give me the opportunity to re-experience a fear that in the past had bested me.  <br>It had overcome me. So even though that, I knew that it was very likely that I would be... see, I don't want to use the word "forced" because I mean, there is an element of force, right? Because once we're veiled and something happens here, it's consistent; it's persistent; it remains in our face. You know, if we get sick or if somebody dies, you know, it doesn't just go away. You have to deal with it, right?  <br>So that's how we experience trauma here, and that's what makes it so challenging. It doesn't just go away if we wanted to instantaneously, but from that perspective, I knew the value of that. You see, I knew that our immortal being was deeper than the pain, deeper than any limitation, deeper than any trauma that might befall me.  <br>No, in fact, I could see, oh my gosh, there's so much opportunity here. Now, does it take some bravery? Yeah, I mean, the spirit is not... you know, it's not an uninformed decision to come here. I will say that the decision is made from a place where fear is obvious that there's no need to fear. You know, so in that case, you know, that's kind of... I guess you could say that's a form of not seeing it the way we're going to see it here.  <br>But on the other hand, in the pre-life review, we experience everything from a first-person point of view. Like, we really review the whole life. Like, we see it all; we feel it all. We are very well informed. It's just that we also know there's nothing to fear, whereas here, we might actually get lost in fear.  <br>Interviewer: It's interesting. So you're mentioning a pre-life review. So you actually do you see your entirety of your life out before you incarnate? Is that...  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yes, but it's not predestined. It's a probability tree of what might, what is likely to unfold. So the way I saw it was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side—this is just a metaphor—but it was like this: If you started at the thick end of the tree, like at the roots, and you worked your way out to the branches, there were millions and millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold.  <br>And I could see and review and feel all of them at once, like in a second. Like, it wasn't hard to process all of the... I mean, it sounds crazy from the human point of view, but what consciousness is a ridiculously wide bandwidth. So I could see the whole thing all at once, and I could see what was likely and what was less likely.  <br>Like, I knew it was very likely that my body would have a major health issue in my 20s, and it would give me a chance to re-experience the fear that I wanted to integrate. You know, I saw... well, I saw there's a lot to it. It's hard to describe, but basically, what's so... what's the thing that chooses the branch? It's free will choice-making—mine and the choice-making of every other player in the game.  <br>Like, you might choose something that affects me, and then I have to deal with it. But see, that's the value. See, that's the novelty of the simulation is that we might... we don't know exactly what's going to happen. We see all the potentials because the system's super good at predicting, but we don't know exactly what's going to happen.  <br>And so then, when things arise, we get to choose how to respond, and wow, that's that novelty is very valuable actually.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, as the minute you laid the tree down and put it horizontal and then mapping out, I started visualizing like 8 billion trees like in all the interdependencies, and my mind kind of just went into a... for what this universe is, was like, wow.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, and then Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer Tom Campbell, talks about how many billions of times per second all the simulations' probabilities are recalculated as it sees what's unfolding, as it learns. So and then all of the unactualized paths are also retained.  <br>I know this sounds really mind-blowing, but we call that the Akashic records. So that is the database where everything that we didn't choose—that the system, I mean, it's not complete; it's not infinite, but it's practically infinite. It's so freaking huge. So we can go into that and pull out information and say, "Well, what if I would have made this choice? What would my life have looked like, or what would the lives of other people have looked like?"  <br>And that's available for us to review post-life because, or even during life, but primarily post-life because there's huge value in seeing that for learning opportunity.  <br>Interviewer: Back to today's podcast: Beyond fascinating. Just a struck, really. Um, the... you mentioned the word "simulation" a couple of times now. We're talking about the Akashic records here. Um, you also mentioned... I'm trying to string a few SS into one question here... um, that Earth isn't the only place that we incarnate.  <br>Um, and when you're using the word like "simulation," I definitely wanted to ask about Maya and the nature of Maya because I think many people say that Maya is an illusion, so it's all not real, but then also in some ways, following your work, it's realer than real, but it's also not real. It's such a trick for the mind to grasp. Um, so yeah.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so let me try to use a metaphor. Right, okay, so like when you go to sleep at night and you have a dream, you have an experience of something. Maybe it doesn't even make sense, but it's a bunch of symbols and places and stuff happens, and then when you wake up in the morning, it's obvious there was no real dream. Like, you didn't really go to the jungle and get chased by a tiger, but you had an experience, and it, you know, and you might have felt certain feelings, you know, but when but from the perspective of waking up in the morning, it's very obvious that there's no tiger and no jungle.  <br>You don't need somebody to prove it to you; it's self-evident. So that's kind of how it is with the physical simulation, actually, is that it's self-evident from higher perspectives that this is not fundamentally real, but are you having an experience? Oh, yes, you know, and that's something I'm sensitive to when, you know, certain non-dual traditions, you know, may say, "Oh, you're not actually having an experience."  <br>I don't agree with that because there's a value to having the experience, even if the form that we experience is not fundamentally real. You know, even if you aren't actually your thoughts and you just think of your thoughts, or even if you're not just the body, there's value to being the body and being the thinker. You see, and then and then learning through that, learning of the being by being that, there is value to that experience, even if the form itself is not fundamentally real.  <br>Interviewer: Kind of leads me into a point about the present moment because you emphasize that this moment really adds the power because here you can feel your fears and actually you don't just heal them apparently here; you heal them if I understood your book correctly, like across like multiple places. And maybe you can explain the places or... can you explain that process and how individuals harness... facilitate our spiritual growth?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, sure. This is very difficult to describe as well, but let's just say it this way: So okay, so we like to think in linear time because here we are, and there's a beginning and there's an end. So what do you mean if I do it now, it affects everything? What does that mean? Okay, linear time is part of the simulation, and all so sequence happens at in higher realms and higher systems.  <br><br><br>There is a form of sequence, but all this is going to sound crazy, but all now moments are happening in this one now. Okay, so if you can do something in this now, you can't help but touch all the nows because it's all one now. So if you completely accept a fear now, you completely integrate an experience now, you choose love now, you see, you are affecting all other nows that other aspects of yourself may be experiencing too.  <br>This is just the now that this is the little now that you're doing it for the big now. The ripples are truly...  <br>Interviewer: And is this where you believe quantum and quantum entanglement is all really speaking to and trying to uncover more rooms?  <br>Christian Sundberg: My understanding of quantum entanglement and quantum manifestation is simply that the quantum is just how we describe the probabilistic simulated nature of our universe arriving.  <br>Like, it doesn't need to yield data until data is required by consciousness for something in a measurement. Until you ask for something, it doesn't need... like, the forest doesn't need to be there until you look at it. I know that sounds wild, but really, that's what the double-slit... when you know, you talk about the wave versus the slit, you know, how is light both?  <br>Well, they've done it with Bucky balls, which are carbon atoms, so it's not just light that we're talking about; we're talking about matter. Matter does the same thing. Matter is a wave or a particle depending on whether or not it needs to be measured. You see, so that's because all of matter is simulated.  <br>Interviewer: Sorry, yeah, no, well, I'm interrupting, so I apologize, but I can't help but... like, the first time I got introduced to this, it totally blew my mind because the metaphor that dropped into me was like, am I when you're driving away from your home, your home is no longer like bricks and mortar; it just goes back into an energetic state, and then when you rock back up, it's like matter again.  <br>And it's like, is this really...  <br>Christian Sundberg: Well, yeah, yeah, I would say... I would say don't necessarily think of it as two things because it's not like it changes state. The entire world of form is simulated. That's all. So it doesn't need to change state. It'd be like saying if you sit down to play a video game, all the blocks in Minecraft are just rendered or not depending on whether or not they need to be, and the simulation just remembers really well.  <br>It's got, you know, it keeps record of everything, so it knows there's blocks there.  <br>Interviewer: Christian, before I forget, just before we were talking about... um, and I'm jumping back just a little bit, but you mentioned life coming down like, you know, there was a certain sense of fear for yourself, but there was an incredible opportunity. And before the life review, I couldn't help but wanted to ask you a question around it seems like the bigger the challenge, the bigger the fear, the greater the transformation, but it potential transformation.  <br>Sorry to interrupt.  <br>Christian Sundberg: No, perfect. Yeah, that's an important distinction because if you... yeah, go ahead.  <br>Interviewer: My question is like, it sort of eludes souls to be somewhat masochistic in some way. Just... I'm sure that's not the case, and so I just wanted to clear that up.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, sure. No, that's a great... I understand that how that would be perceived. We are not masochistic. So I think a good metaphor is, is a weightlifter masochistic for lifting weights? Well, I mean, you know, no, maybe a little, but like, it's more about it's not about hurting yourself; it's about getting stronger.  <br>Like, if you go out and go for a run, you don't do that for pain; you do that for health and for vibrancy of being. You see, so it's a little bit like that. Like, why would we choose... now, so if you lay down on a weight bench and you're not conditioned and you try to lift a thousand pounds, it's just going to crush you. It's not going to help. There's no... it's not helpful.  <br>And so the guides are actually very skilled and evolved at helping us select an optimal level of challenge so that we're at a place where the... I don't mean to make this sound dry, but where the weightlifting is profitable, you know, basically where we can engage a set of circumstances that may challenge us in a certain way that we may actually grow in a meaningful way or serve others in a meaningful way, you know, grow love in some meaningful way.  <br>Um, yeah, so yeah, it's not about masochism; it's about choosing the optimal type of constraint, level of constraint, and those constraints shift day in and day out for all of us. Like, even as the body changes state, like, you know, if the body gets sick, your constraints just change. It's harder to make loving decisions when you're in pain, you know, and every lifetime has its own unique constraints—its unique bodily constraints, the family constraints, the society, you know, the energy of the planet.  <br>Actually, Earth has its own thing going on—its own collective consciousness process and themes. That's all types of definition and constraint that we work with, and so we tend to choose constraints that will be helpful and useful for us. Like, in my case, I chose a life that was going to be a good fit for processing a fear that had bested me before.  <br>And the guides brought me this life, actually. They brought me a previous life that was an even better fit than this one, but I had rejected that life just after incarnating while I was still in the womb, and I caused a miscarriage. I know that sounds wild too, but I had a life review for that, and I saw that my fear caused that life to end prematurely.  <br>So I still had the same intention to process this certain kind of fear, and so they brought me this life, and this life was like... it was good; it was a good match, but it wasn't like, you know, it wasn't as perfect or near perfect as the first one would have been. So we do have to kind of choose, okay, what's the optimal level of weight, and what kind of weight?  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, this is a really fun part to dive into in the conversation. Well, it's all been fun, but the guide conversation starts to open up because even you mentioned you're communicating with beings before incarnating, and you were asking to retain some memory, and then it was like, who were you asking? Who are they? What was like... we're like, what? Like, who are these guys?  <br>Um, but you mentioned guides, and obviously there's like ascended masters, angels... well, not obviously, there are, but yeah, I'd just like to open the floor to get in here and...  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, sure. Well, first of all, just a quick about environment because here on Earth, we think reality is environment. You know, that's how we understand reality. Tell me what you visually saw and where you physically were because that's reality.  <br>So tell me that, and now I'll understand. Well, there were definitely visual contexts, and there were definitely places, but it's also way bigger than that. It's also a knowing level connectedness and location that transcends the need for physical visual stimulus.  <br>At the same time, anyway, I just want to point that out. Okay, so the guides... so I'm not super careful about trying to like put them into buckets, you know, about these guides and those guides, and these are ascended masters and those aren't. I mean, from Earth, we have a very crude, limited understanding of these things in general, broadly speaking.  <br>Um, but I'll just say that there are more evolved beings that help us, and they may be beings who have had physical experiences like we are having now. They may be beings who haven't, and we may have personal guides. So those are guides that know us really well and are really good in understanding us and understanding the context we signed up for and helping us and nudging us throughout life and watching over us.  <br>And then there are guides that might visit us for short periods of time that are really, really skilled at a certain kind of qualitative experience, actually. So like, let's say you're dealing with a certain type of personal challenge—a certain emotion, even. There may be a guide who shows up just very briefly because that guide is a master at that. Like, they really understand that; they really get that.  <br>So they'll show up because they can see that that's profitable. They'll arrive, and they'll help a little tiny bit. So I'm just pointing that out because I mean, ascended masters, you know, we typically would say that's someone who's evolved so much through the physical that they've basically mastered the game.  <br>They basically have processed and integrated more or less the entirety of the limitations set here. That's, in a sense, mastery. So and they're godlike in power and love because they've come so far. Um, so anyway, just some comments there.  <br>Interviewer: No, that's profound. And your connection to guides in like when you're in the day-to-day, like, do you connect to your guides? Well, two questions: Are your connections to guides, and then also your connection to God? We haven't even approached the topic of God that you as God...  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so I'm aware that I have guides, but I do not have common constant interaction. I've had some limited interaction. I had a friend who was able to have out-of-body experiences check in on that a while ago for me, like 10 years ago. I was curious, and he said something like, "They say that you're so intellectual that if they interact with you directly, you'll take what they tell you too much."  <br>And so I appreciate that, you know, but I look forward to meeting them someday because I know I've gotten some nudges that have been super helpful for me. Um, but anyway, to the second part of your question, the relationship with God... oh my gosh, I mean, that is like the most intrinsic, meaningful, important relationship for all of us.  <br>It's not just me, you know. We may not know it; we may not know that's the thing we're looking for, but it's like we are a drop in the ocean of all that is. The drop is a part of the ocean; it yearns for the ocean. The ocean knows it best; it is the ocean. So how can you not have a relationship with that?  <br>Well, of course, practically speaking, what we're talking about really is how deeply form-associated and ego-associated are you because that's obscuring at the human personality level. And I personally feel I have a very strong relationship with God, and I feel that is more alive and thriving now than even in, you know, my religious upbringing.  <br>You know, I had a religious tradition I held dear until about the age of 30, um, but that relationship, that connecting is, oh my gosh, it's the most real thing, and it's absolute joy and bliss, and it's available to all of us when we let go enough sufficiently and when we really look at ourselves deeply enough.  <br>Interviewer: You're referring to letting go there, and obscurations are really deep fascination of mind because it's... yeah, it's what creates the haze and probably inviting in the conversation. It's interesting because at this particular point in the conversation, it's quite profound because you could feel into someone that's, you know, atheistic.  <br>It's not necessarily right or wrong; they're just on their own path to some degree, um, and that's what they've chosen to this particular rite, and but also that in some ways could potentially make it somewhat harder even because they don't have that connection to sort of guide them through the journey, uh, but maybe that's what their soul chose for them at this particular point.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Mhm, so the nature of being is connected and a part of God, and so that's okay if then if someone entertains thought form and believes in it—so thought form being in this case an atheistic belief system—it's not like beingness, you know, has a big problem with that. They are beingness; they are entertaining thoughts. They can't not be what they are, you know, and that true nature—back to the term true nature—is always what they are, and it can't be threatened.  <br>And so meanwhile, you know, if they... all of us work through some intellectual understanding, through some intellectual context, you know, we understand the world a certain way. Atheism is just one of those ways, and so but form association—that is how deeply we associate with those thoughts—it can practically speaking be obscuring because we fall asleep into being that, you know.  <br>Like, if you think, "I want a sandwich," at that moment, you are the being who is hungry and wants a sandwich. That's the nature of the thought. You're not all the all; you're not knowing yourself as the stars and the sky. I say that because of my pre-birth experience. Right after incarnating, I had this moment when God showed me what we really are.  <br>You know, the... I not lost my true nature. We have not lost our true nature. This is just so important to lift up, and within me was the sun as an example. I could feel it in my body. It was oh, it's beautiful, raging with bliss. It was so beautiful. That's still there, but if I'm having the thought, "Oh, I have to go to work," or "Put gas in my car," then that's okay.  <br>At that moment, that is the thought I am.  <br>Interviewer: How you... hey there, inspired soul! Quick question: What are you taking away from today's incredibly rich conversation? I'd love to hear from you in the comments below. Also, Christian's likely going to come back on the podcast in the future.  <br>What are your questions for Christian that you feel like I didn't get to ask today that you would love answered? Maybe we can collect them and ask them the next time he's on the show.  <br>Christian Sundberg: When we talk about obfuscation of consciousness, we can talk about form association as a concept.  <br>So that is how associated with form are we? How associated with thinking have we become? How associated with the body and its sensory information have we become? How associated with the story or with the understanding? The reason I put it like that is the veil. It doesn't actually separate us.  <br>All it does is obscure the active knowing of all of our total self. That's all it does. It's neutral; it's just like a veil. It's just like a cover, and then so it doesn't actually prevent that connection. It's simply that when we don't see the rest, we end up focusing into the physical and focusing on thoughts and forms and story, and then we become that.  <br>And so that's why, like, young kids, like babies, they're in and out, you know. They have... they go in and out of the body very regularly because they're not deeply form-associated yet, but by the time we get to be like three, four, five, six, you know, okay, now this is who I am; this is my identity, and then that kind of cements it.  <br>It's a little bit like if you sit in a movie theater and you stare at the movie screen. If you stare really hard and are thinking about the movie, you feel like you're in the movie. Are you actually in the movie? No, you were never actually in the movie. That's kind of how it is with spirit as well.  <br>Interviewer: It's interesting because almost with the same metaphor, it's like when you first sit down to watch a movie, you're more aware that you're not actually watching a movie. The more you watch the movie, the more you're actually feeling like you're engrossed in the narrative, and you're and you're actually part of it.  <br>An interesting part about the forgetting component, um, because it seems like the forgetting and the veil are necessary for you to actually have as deep an experience as possible.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yes, yeah, the veil permits complete immersion or near complete immersion. That's its purpose, you know. If through the veil, you can experience what it's like to be the human. Like, if you want to be the human, you got to be the human, man. You're not the whole; now you're now you're a human.  <br>That's the name of the game. That's the nature of the veil is that now you get to experience exactly what it's like to be just this. That's what the veil permits.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, so back to the question. So even at this particular juncture, it feels like certain people that are choosing like an atheist thought form, right, choosing not to believe in God, um, yet they're not even wrong in their own... like, they're not wrong or like wrong or right, but they're not necessarily wrong or right, um, but that's just a choice that they've made that is then it must be somewhat more challenging or like, you know, it's hard to understand because then obviously they don't have that connection in current to God that you described that is the most profound and sacred connection that we carry in our life touch with.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Well, I wouldn't actually name atheism as a unique type. Like, it's not like you lose your connection if you believe you don't have a connection. Uh, the question is, are you buying into any perception that's not in alignment with our true nature? And that happens in far more than atheism, you know.  <br>That happens anytime we buy into a negative self-perception of powerlessness or shame, you know. You know, those are very common examples on Earth of where now we're not the whole; now you are experiencing the vibration of shame or powerlessness. And so atheism is just an example of an intellectual thought form where we believe there's, you know, there's no God.  <br>I mean, you know, that's just one example of kind of, you know, buying into a perception that might not be helpful potentially, but not necessarily.  <br>Interviewer: It's interesting because there are so many again, we're back to that, you know, the... there are so many thought forms that distract us from our true nature, and it's hard sort of then at this particular point you can't even look at it as good or bad. It's just it's teaching you about your true nature due to the nature of duality and the contrast.  <br>It's becoming super clear in this conversation as we're having this conversation, um, the space is quite quite rich and very informative, very stretchy. Learn.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yes, it's a stretch for the physically focused, you know, Earth thinking mind, but for the being, oh my gosh, um, it is all about the expansion of that true nature through knowing something, through being something, through making choices in a rich context. That's yes, that's very valuable, and it's something we keep, you know.  <br>Like, the form will fall away; the body will fall away; the limitations will fall away. They're not what we are, but you get to keep knowing that. You get to keep the knowing that you took from that forever. You will know what it was like to be whatever you've been, and that is valuable. That's precious. It's precious to the soul.  <br>Interviewer: At this particular juncture, what do you wish people knew about their true nature that they may have forgotten? What do you wish everybody knew about their nature?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: I wish that everybody knew that there's nothing to fear. I wish that everybody knew that there's absolutely no reason to fear. I mean, no true reason. I mean, obviously, on the surface, in the physical, we got a heck of a lot of reasons that rise up, but when it comes to what is fundamentally real, we absolutely have nothing to fear.  <br>All is a part of the whole, and there is no way it can fail. There's no way it can die. There's no way it can lose what it truly is. There's no way that you can't be loved. That's not possible. And when we really know that, the causes of fear—the roots of fear—evaporate, you know, because they're always based in something that's not fundamentally in alignment with the larger truth.  <br>So I wish that everybody here knew that there's nothing to fear because when we know that, oh my gosh, it's so much easier to be and express our true nature—the love and the peace and the joy of what we really are. Like, oh, that and that's what we're here to do is be love, be joy, be freedom. We can do that almost automatically when we don't have fear.  <br>Interviewer: You mentioned earlier that the Earth is kind of going through its own shift. So yeah, it's... I don't know, my brain went into like system upgrade, and that's probably too 3D way to describe it, but um, is the Earth kind of transforming on its own journey as an entity as well?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yes, so yeah, when you talk about the Earth, we could talk about the Earth as a being, but I'm generally referring to the collective consciousness of humanity and the other players that are here as in this simulation of this planet, and there is an awakening process happening.  <br>So that collective consciousness is going through a process of processing out thousands of years of lower vibrational thought form fear and evolving. That means, you know, actualizing love and working past the lower vibrations towards a more full expression of our true nature.  <br>That's happening now. It's something that the collective consciousness is going through, and that's not just humans; it's actually the whole collective consciousness, but the human race is like a huge part of it.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, the question for me is, are we all like... we're always it's interesting because we're always evolving and we're always growing, but yet this particular moment in time seems to be even more so than usual. Is that what I'm hearing is that because then also it brings into like what's going on in the back of my mind is the cycles and the yogas and different ages that we live through?  <br>Um, is that part of this the shift that we're going through? Does that speak to it underneath a little bit? Yeah, please, I'd love to get your thoughts on that.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so okay, so we can call this period we're going through just the awakening, um, you know, for lack of a better word, and it's just like the act of the play. So what does consciousness do through systems of form? It evolves; it integrates experience, and it grows. That's what it does.  <br>So we're always doing that. Like, you could say that like the expansion of love, the deepening of love and joy, is always happening. Now, it does go through waxing and waning cycles. It doesn't just happen in a straight line. So any given person, any given lifetime, any given species has waves and troughs of experience, and that's just the nature of how consciousness processes out darkness, you could say, but works through experience and evolves upward.  <br>So right now, the Earth is going through like kind of a very rapid transition period where it is seeking to process a whole bunch of old gunk kind of all at once. And you know, when we say it's quick, I mean, the human personality might say, "Well, how quick is it? 'Cause look, everything's kind of a mess and blah blah."  <br>You know, I don't like that. I mean, one lifetime is a very short amount of time when you're talking about the context of the Earth and even the human race. One generation is like so short, but even within one generation, there has been and will continue to be a huge shift in consciousness—a huge processing out of the old and an increase in vibration so that more and more of our true nature can come and be actualized here on Earth.  <br>Interviewer: It's interesting because as you're sharing that, I couldn't help but visualize like a sine wave, and I remember I think it was me listening to Alan Watts many years ago, but he mentioned like if you picture the sine wave, you know, there's a line going through the middle, just you know, an axis, and there's life, and then there's the afterlife, and then there's life, and there's before life, and there, you know, it's like there's just the crescent, you know, there's the peaks and the troughs, and you know, because you're mentioning peaks and troughs, I couldn't help but reflect on that.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Um, yeah, so so we do it not only within a life. Within a life, there are peaks and troughs, but at the level, we do it. The trough, we incarnate down into the lower vibration; the peak, we return, and we process all of that, and you know, we reach even greater heights, and then we decide we want to do it again perhaps, and so we go back down into a trough, and we repeat the cycle.  <br>And in fact, the... let's get too crazy here, but the entire universe even does something like that, you know. Like, we process the entire universe goes through this great out-breath of processing of experience. We're all a part of it, and then eventually it resolves. You could say this is super long periods of time we're talking about now, but we process the entirety of this.  <br>It returns to that state of wholeness and rest, and then we may decide to go through another wave. So yeah, so this wave and, you know, sine wave metaphor applies kind of at all different levels of experience. I mean, we are like fractal beings, so as above, so below.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, that is so interesting, and actually the... shouldn't say hilarious bit, but actually the bit that's just flipped on its head for me is previously, and this is how the lay person versus, well, I don't say versus carrying the awareness that you have, but having the memories that you have, this is anyway, I'll stop talking for a sec.  <br>The sine waves I had the like because we look at life as kind of like above the line and then death kind of under the Earth, right? So me was like above, and that's the thing, right? And you just flipped it on its head. It's like no, we ascend, and then we descend into Earth, and then we're back, and yeah, it's really interesting that literally just flipped the model on its head for me, and it's beautiful.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: It's beautiful. It's funny you say that because sometimes when I see the afterlife depicted as like a gray place, like Hades in Greek mythology or something, you know, that is backwards. The human being in the human state is the more dead state. Um, in fact, incarnation is the step that is the hard step.  <br>You know, that's the lowering of vibration down, the adopting of huge limitation. That's incarnation. Birth. Death is the opposite. Death is release; it's completely complete return to freedom. It's expanding back out. That's not a problem; that's wonderful and beautiful. So you've already done the hard part. The hard part is being here.  <br>You know, not that it has to be hard. I'm just saying life by life, I should say more clearly, not the hard part, the limiting part is being here. The more dead state, the more dense, constrained state is being physical.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, somehow you mentioned recalling the birthing of this particular universe. Can you share more about that experience? What it reveals about our existence in the broader cosmos?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, so I remember... okay, um, this is so hard to describe. Being a... I'll just try to be succinct. Being a part of the collective and knowing that all of us, but also the whole source, was issuing forth this intent like, "We're going to do this in a whole new way now."  <br>Like new, like even an even new denser level with even more opportunity. Like, we have done it before. Like, this is not the first veiled experience, the physical. Our physical universe is not like take one. I don't know how many there have been, or I don't know the scope or the scale. I don't know any of that.  <br>I just know that our physical universe is not the first, you know, simulation, the first go at a veil, you know. So I remember in that state knowing, "Oh my gosh, this is going to be so exciting." And I don't remember the moment that like because there was a moment of creative initiation. I don't... I wasn't around for that for some reason. I don't know why, but I remember sailing through the galaxies.  <br><br><br>I know this sounds wild. I know how wild this sounds. I get it, but sailing through the galaxies and being in awe at their beauty and being so excited to participate and being like, "Wow, we get to be these things." It wasn't just humans; it was anything we wanted in the universe. We could be that; we could experience that.  <br>It was this banquet of, oh my gosh, rich, just rich form experience that we were creating for ourselves that we got to experience and work through. Oh, it was beautiful.  <br>Interviewer: It's really interesting because circling back to what you were talking about, and maybe I'll ask that question next actually, you also mentioned there are other places to incarnate to. So you're sailing to the galaxies. Are you witnessing some of these other places that people could potentially incarnate into? Is that part of that, or is that outside of the universe? How does this...  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Okay, so okay, so there's a layer of being where there's a layer of reality that's very close to our universe.  <br>I'm just going to make up a term. I don't know if this is a real term, but call it the local astral, like some kind of astral level that's very, very close. So we are seeing it, touching it; we're very, we're really, we're right there, but we're not actually in it because we're not incarnated. Okay, so that is not... I wouldn't mix that up.  <br>Like, when I was sailing through the universe, that was not a pre-incarnate process for me. That was a completely separate, very much earlier experience, whereas later, after I had gone through many incarnations, I was in kind of a specific... oh my gosh, how do you describe this?  <br>Let's say that there is a realm above our own—we'll keep it simple—from which we make the decision to incarnate, and that realm is a realm of living light where information flows very quickly, and it's still lower vibration than potentially higher realms, but it's way higher than the Earth plane.  <br>And from there, there's an interaction with guides, and these decisions can be made because we can review the potential very thoroughly.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, so something just popped in, which was we're talking about... we're talking about the sun, talking about different reincarnations, and in the Hindu philosophy, they say that you know more complex levels of being are a sign of spiritual evolution for one soul.  <br>So like, I'm being super crude here, but you come as a mouse, then you come as a cat, then you come as a dog, then you come as a human, and those people that love cats will be like, "Am, you got that the wrong way around. It's mouse, dog, cat." I won't get into the debate around that. I'm a dog person, so pardon me.  <br>Um, but you go mouse, cat, dog, human, but then also interestingly because we have seen like such an erosion of species on the planet, and yet there is such proliferation of humans at the moment, but it seemed kind of almost like the balance of souls on the planet is probably somewhat the same. It's just there's more humans now.  <br>I'm wondering if there's been if that also points to this awakening that you are speaking to that's happening on the planet. I don't know; I just couldn't help draw those...  <br>Christian Sundberg: Sure, yeah, interesting. So I mean, I'm not... okay, I will say that the soul requires a certain level of proficiency in order to play a human. It's not like, you know, newbie level. It's pretty involved; it's pretty complex. There's a cognitive experience that is very demanding actually, and that is not to say necessarily that from my perspective, that is not to say categorically that a soul who would incarnate as a human is more evolved than a soul who would incarnate as some other form.  <br>No, soul has evolution, and meanwhile, a soul may choose to have certain experiences. So an evolved being could certainly choose to be something that's not human. That's okay. Uh, on the other hand, like I said, a more evolved being is more apt to take on a highly complex life with such a rich cognitive experience and strange depth of separation that we humans experience demand.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, I'm leaning back into your experience of this particular lifetime. Um, you're carrying memories, and as you alluded to earlier, it's formed here that would actually be harder, um, because you'll be aware of the contrast even amongst the dualities. This is like even the contrast. Um, how's that affected you personally in your life if you don't mind me asking?  <br>Um, like, do you interact with energies or vibrations beyond physical senses?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, it's natural to interact with energy beyond physical senses because as we return to greater awareness of who we really are, um, that's still there even though we're veiled. We're still connected to the whole.  <br>So I am energetically sensitive. I do receive... receive is such a bad word... I experience energy interaction with people or other things, or sometimes I'll pull information out of the database not even trying to. Sometimes that's just kind of normal, um, but about my experience, I would say that it is very challenging day-to-day.  <br>The average vibration on Earth is quite low, and I'm very homesick, um, but I do seek to try to allow even this. You know, this is an opportunity. I feel it. I know that this is a huge opportunity for me and for others. I can feel it even though there are days when I'm like, "Wow, this is a lot. I feel like this is a lot."  <br>I still seek to allow and accept even that as a lotus because I know the value of that. So to put it simply, the vibrational difference may be extreme, um, but I also feel the extreme opportunity, and I seek to allow and utilize that the best way I can.  <br>Interviewer: I must want to apologize for this next question before I even ask it. I've had people reach out to listen to the podcast and touch what it's... it's very humbling to receive some of these messages. You mentioned the word "homesick," and I think that can also allude to people wanting to somewhat check out, you know.  <br>Um, I guess a lighter way to ask the question would be, how does taking one's own life affect the probability tree that you mentioned earlier? Um, because I think yeah, for some people, they're in some... they're in a really dense, dark place. Um, to like you said, it can be quite dense and dark here, but I think yeah, obviously... well, not obviously, that's the question.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, yeah, so first of all, the probability tree—that would be the end of the probability tree, you know, because the end of the physical life is where that probability tree no longer... you know, that's the definition of death is the end of a life journey.  <br>Okay, now I want to be very sensitive to the question, uh, very sensitive because there's a couple of things going on here at the same time, and these two things need to be said simultaneously. The first, most fundamental level is we are absolutely unconditionally loved no matter what.  <br><br><br>We are unconditionally loved no matter what, and in a sense, there's nothing to forgive, okay? So I have to say that first because even in the context of something as dire as suicide, there is nothing that is beyond unconditional love and beyond the incredible wisdom of source. Nothing, okay?  <br>So we are unconditionally loved; we are free to make choices. Simultaneously, in general, suicide tends to not be an effective way out because it means, in general, generally speaking, that we have fear that we have not processed, and it is because of the fear typically and the rejection that we have chosen suicide.  <br>And we are who we are, and we take who we are with us. You see, so if you're a being who has fear, then just because the life ends doesn't necessarily mean you don't have that anymore. It's still you are, so you might as well face it now.  <br>Now, that is not a judgment; that's not, you know, it's not a damning thing. It's simply that it's not truly an escape in that sense, in that sense. But both of these ideas have to be held simultaneously because the unconditional love and the fact that we are free to make any choice that is... oh, that's all that's true, but we are also responsible for every choice we make, and that is absolutely also true.  <br>100% responsible—every thought, every action, every intention. We are responsible for so if we choose suicide, that's usually a very destructive choice, not only for the self but for many other people, and we are responsible for that. That's karma is what the word we use for that.  <br>It means you are who you are, and the choices that you've made may have had an effect, and that effect stays with you in a sense like because you are who you are, and so it's not wise to choose fear, and that's true whether it's suicide or some other context.  <br><br><br>Like, I'm not making... I'm actually not drawing a distinction between suicide and other fear-based choices. Fear is always insane; fear is always suboptimal. It's just that suicide is a strong example of high fear.  <br>Interviewer: Thank you so much for answering that question. Yeah, and the sensitivity you brought to it is... um, looking into a different space just really quickly because I'm conscious of the amount of time we've got left. I remember you saying like on the other side, like you would think that beyond this place, um, like is the substrate of consciousness that it's all built on is like this... it's a space of like it's empty; it's a void; it's you know, um, and yet you... oh no, it's not empty.  <br>Can you describe that?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, yeah, sure. So when I said that, I was like, "Oh yeah, so you know, now we're definitely getting into a topic that from duality is hard to talk about, but let's just put it this way: Consciousness itself, when not engaging any form set, experiences the void."  <br>So that means it's like a loading screen. It's like, metaphorically, if you go into your computer and you try to load... you know, you don't load anything; you just got blank nothing. That's the void, and it's kind of a natural stepping point to other reality systems actually because it's like stepping out of one system into the loading screen, and then maybe you go into another reality system.  <br>Who are you in between? You're just consciousness, and by the way, that can be fear-provoking for people because if they think they're the ego protections, and the ego protections get stripped away, all of a sudden, it seems terrifying, but it's not that the void is terrifying; it's that we have fear, and when we look at it, it's terrifying.  <br>Meanwhile, the void can also be experienced as bliss because our true nature is bliss. It's love and peace and joy. That is the fabric of it, okay? And that fabric contains everything, so that's why we say the void is often described as being pregnant.  <br>I've heard that term used for describing the void—the pregnant void. It's nothing, but it also has every potentiality within it. Well, yes, that's because it's a loading screen that hasn't loaded anything yet, but it could load anything and everything that is within beingness.  <br>Everything that is within consciousness is a part of consciousness and could be loaded, and thus it is very pregnant. Does that help?  <br>Interviewer: It does. It begs the question: Is consciousness just unconditional love in some ways?  <br>Christian Sundberg: So now you're trying to put a form name on consciousness, and we can't actually do that, um, because consciousness transcends all form. So if we want to know what something is, we say, "Tell me if it's this object or that object; tell me if it's this feeling or that feeling because now I know which one it is."  <br>All objects, all feelings are made of consciousness and arise within consciousness, and consciousness we could say though it's true fabric—the closest words we have are love and peace and freedom and joy. So you have to start with consciousness and then describe love and peace and freedom and joy.  <br>You don't start actually even with some feeling called love. It's just the closest thing we've got, and people who come back from near-death experiences say, "Oh my gosh, it was all love, and God is love, and it's so much love," and they don't know what else to say, but that's the best; that's the closest word we have, but we'd have to magnify it by a trillion trillion trillion trillion to even barely touch the depth of the fullness of that stuff.  <br>Notice I'm not saying that feeling even; it's not it; it's joy and love are of it. You see, it's like it is first—consciousness is first—and joy and love and freedom are like the expression of it. They're like they're what it refracts into in a world of form like ours.  <br>You see, that true nature, when it shines through here, looks like and feels like love and peace and joy and freedom.  <br>Interviewer: It's so interesting because even at this particular juncture in the conversation, I think for normally, emotions are something that are difficult to point to, but it feels like they're almost like they're almost matter in this conversation. Um, the roles of emotions on our spiritual growth and evolution—can you speak to emotion?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Sure, well, first, let me just say that I don't draw a huge distinction between different forms even though I understand that at the human level, we experience them very differently. So like, sensory data—you know, a sight, a sound, a smell—those are different than a feeling or an idea.  <br>The idea of a sandwich is not the same as seeing a sandwich. Those are different types of form, so I'm just lifting that up though because all of form is transcended. So that's just an important thing to say about the nature of what form is.  <br>I use the word "emotion" differently than the word "feeling." Um, emotion is the way I describe a biochemical feeling. So if you have depression, you have an emotion of pain or sadness or whatever. Is that who you are? No, that's a lie.  <br>And by the way, I just want to go down a little tangent here because when we talk about the suicide question, something I really want to lift up is it's a lie. Like, even though it's very real, that pain, that story, that negative, terrible story—"The pain will never end; you'll never feel better; this is who you are; you're meaningless"—that is a lie.  <br>I'm not making light of it; I'm not making light of it. I'm just lifting that up, okay? So back to your question: So emotion I would say is like the biochemical experience of a feeling, but the soul—okay, so consciousness can know incredible feeling even without a body.  <br>In fact, it can know feelings that are way off the charts—even more real and more lucid than what we know bodily. The bodily experience is unique in that it is dense and it is novel. So what I mean is like if you put a piece of food in your mouth, you're going to get a taste sensation that you don't know exactly what to expect, and it will show up, and you discover it.  <br>That's how it feels when you put something in your mouth, whereas in higher systems, when you're connected to all knowing, you might not have that exact same sense of novelty because it's all already there. That's just an example of a unique aspect of human experience.  <br><br><br>So emotion is kind of like that at the human level, and it is a very important part of our journey because feeling—which, like I said, emotion is like a biochemical reflection of feeling—it's, you know, with the chemicals and the brain chemistry and all that good stuff—feeling vibration at the soul level, the vibration of feeling, that's like the language of the soul.  <br>It's more telling than thoughts and words in certain ways; it's more true. You can't mistake a feeling. Like, it's, you know, you know what I mean? It is what it is; it's saying a certain vibration already.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, but it requires a certain level of, I would say, awareness to be able to feel into your feelings because I think again with the obscurations, I know I keep coming back to them, we sort of... we repress the opportunity to feel in certain ways because it can be uncomfortable to... it again probably to feel certain fears, so we sort of... the ego will cover up fears with hundreds and hundreds of layers.  <br>Christian Sundberg: Sorry to interrupt you. The ego will cover up fears underneath hundreds and hundreds of layers of story and justification. That's just what the ego does. It's we're trying to avoid. So if we want to avoid, here, look at this shiny object; here, look at this belief. Don't look at the feeling.  <br>Feel it to heal it. I love that phrase, and what I mean is if you feel a certain way, let yourself see it; let yourself feel it. The integration of experience is very largely done through feeling. Like, it's not an intellectual process; it's a being-level "I'm willing to feel this" process.  <br>"I'm willing to feel this, and I'm going to actually feel it, and holy crap, it feels bigger than me." You see, that's why we lock it away. We lock it away because it feels too big to feel, too big to face. That's why we bury it, swallow it up. It'll swallow you up.  <br>Well, eventually, you get so sick of being sick or so sick of being afraid that you say, "You know what? I'm gonna face that crap. I'm sick of this. I'm gonna feel that all the way," and it may feel like it's going to destroy you, but it won't. It won't destroy you.  <br><br><br>No feeling is bigger than consciousness. Consciousness is occurring in... I mean, feeling is occurring in consciousness. Consciousness precedes the feeling; it can't be bigger. So there's nothing we actually can't say yes to and experience and feel, and that requires a certain warriorship of feeling, actually.  <br>We need to be like... not need to be; we can choose to be willing to allow so much of our experience that we feel even the feelings we rejected, even the fears we rejected. It takes a lot of humility; it takes a lot of bravery.  <br>It takes a lot of bravery to actually say, "You know what? I feel like a small little child," or "I feel like I was never loved, and I feel meaningless." Okay, okay, feel it. Go look; go look. The light of your awareness—when you go into that dark closet, you're bringing the light of your awareness into it, and that is how you process it.  <br>That is how you heal it. It's about not saying no anymore. Like, one thing I would lift up here is that life itself is not our enemy. Like, the physical reality even is not our enemy. The whole physical experience is not our adversary; it's actually here for us, and it wants us to succeed.  <br>Spirit wants us to succeed. You see, so when we genuinely actually choose to face our crap like for real, we are helped; we are supported, and it may require more bravery than we've ever yielded up until this now moment, but that's okay, and that is a process that is done through feeling, through being a feeling to feel and allowing feeling.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: Back to today's podcast: Feel it to heal it. When we say yes to certain feelings, the ego then quickly latches into then identify. Like, let's just say there's a toxic pattern or behavior, and you say yes to it to feel it, to allow it. How do you navigate the ego then identifying with said toxic pattern or behavior such that that becomes like a coalesced part of your identity rather than once again something that moves through it, actually heals?  <br>Christian Sundberg: That's a fantastic question because that is the main challenge—call that stickiness. You know, we get really sticky into our ego patterns because of the fear. Okay, here's the thing though; this is really important: You don't have to be able to identify the root fear because you can't.  <br>Like, when you start down this journey, you can't even tell where you have a misperception. It's buried under 782 layers of crap, like seriously, okay? But there is one active ingredient which you always, always have, and that is: How do you respond to this moment?  <br>Do you say yes to this moment, and do you say yes to the feelings that are arising in this moment? You don't have to understand how they're connected to everything else yet. You don't have to. Are you willing to listen now?  <br>That's why quality of intention is so important. You see, because you can't trick your intent. If your intent is to do this to avoid, then that's your intent, and your ego will gladly do that. But if you genuinely want to heal and you genuinely want to own your crap and you genuinely want to be willing to feel and work with your life, work with the universe, work with yourself, and identify where you've blocked yourself—like, if you're genuinely willing to do that, then you just do that with what has arisen in this moment, whatever it is, even if it's hard.  <br><br><br>It's okay, and as we do that, the deeper parts of us bit by bit say, "Oh, okay, you're working with me here." It's actually one being. The human personality is not separate; it's still you, but at the human level, when you say yes and you're feeling this moment, you're feeling, "Wow, I feel anxiety in my body. I'm just going to feel that. I'm going to feel that and allow that," and you do that in saying yes.  <br>The deeper part of you says, "Okay, I see you're listening," okay, and then another thing may be lifted up to you, and then maybe another thing may be lifted up to you, and because we are basically built to integrate all that and heal all that, we're built to heal.  <br>It's like a simple way to put it: Like, your psyche knows more than even if you... this what we call unconscious, you know, I have all this unconscious stuff buried under there. As we awaken, less and less and less becomes unconscious. That is the nature of awakening.  <br>It's seeing more and more clearly what's actually in there, and as we do that, there is no place for it to hide. We just feel what we feel; we know who we are; we feel the fear that we feel, and it's very humbling, but if we're willing to do it, it's also so empowering because if you process that and allow the yes and say yes in this moment, what can affect you?  <br>What can thwart you? You know, it's like in Buddhism, they say like, you know, something like, "You are your only enemy. Your response is the only thing you're working. The fear is the only hard thing."  <br><br><br>So to your question: If we get tangled up in fear, which we absolutely do at the human level, how do we work through that? This moment with what has arisen in this moment, we seek to allow it, to feel it, to choose love and peace and joy in whatever way we feel called to, to choose authenticity in whatever way we feel called to.  <br>See, it's very authentic; it's a very authentic process, and it's not about avoiding. This is real work; this is not like, you know, light, fluffy stuff all the time. That's what shadow work is all about. It means actually processing the darkness, but man, is there a lot of power in that, and you can do it.  <br>Like, that's like cheat sheet ending here: You can do it. You can.  <br>Interviewer: And I think that goes back to that being that you met that inspired you at the beginning. It's so like in the conversation come full circle because they radiated a certain... is it power? Is that what I call it?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Like, freedom, love.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, and that was for having gone through all the stuff we've just discussed. Is that... I mean, it's true, but I'm sensitive that it's not just that because you put weight on the person, got strong. They got strong because they lifted the weight.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: What is lifting the weight mean? Everything we just said. It means actually choosing love and peace and freedom and joy in your life and actually facing fear and overcoming it and processing it, actually recognizing your own ego patterns and being okay with learning and growing, actually serving the person next to you instead of yourself.  <br>You know what I mean? Like that because that... because what is so the fundamental substrate is consciousness, and but what is the fundamental action? Intent, choice-making. So that's why I love the Tom Campbell term "quality of intent."  <br>If you can choose a quality of intention that is more loving under duress, then that's like exercising a spiritual muscle, and now you can exercise that same intention under different circumstances. In fact, in the... okay, so let's make that a little more tangible.  <br>So like, here on Earth, we can't do very much physically. We're pretty limited in the thought-responsive realms. One thought is a thing; it's an action. Intention equals an action. You want to move a tree; you move the tree, and it moves. It's not hard, okay?  <br>But if you can wield an intention that is powerful and pure, then you metaphorically are like a god compared to other beings in that system who have not had to do it under the same level of limitation that you have. So it's like if you can throw a 100-pound weight on Earth, then if you go to a system and someone hands you one pound, it's nothing. It's not hard.  <br>And so to the other beings, they see you throw that one pound 100 feet, and they're like, "Oh my gosh, how did you do that?" It's not hard, man. I've been on the weight bench where there was a thousand pounds. That's hard. You see, and so that's what we're doing here with the limitations and with the fear that has arisen from them.  <br>Can we process that? Can we meet this limitation with love and joy and freedom? And note, by the way, that doing that does not require a certain physical outcome. It's a quality of intention, not a scope.  <br>Like, you don't have to build 10 companies and reach 10 billion people. You know, and there aren't even 10 billion people. I'm just being a bit facetious. I'm just saying that you don't have to think about physical scope. This is about quality of intention. Quality. It's just the quality.  <br><br><br>Interviewer: And I'm reminded of a near-death experience. Every time I quote this, I forget the person's name, and I apologize once again, but this one NDE this person had where they had a life review, and they saw that the most... one of the most celebrated moments of their life was when they were a kid, and their parents stopped at a rest area, and there was a dry tree out of the way next to the car, and they went down to this river, and they were filling up a bucket for their family, and they went out of their way and put water on that dry tree.  <br>Was that a huge scope—watering a tree one time? While in the physical sense, we would say probably not, but spiritually, that was the moment because they did it out of completely unconditional love. They just wanted to serve the tree even though the bucket was heavy. They went over there, and they dumped a little bit of the water out.  <br>You see, the physical is a simulation anyway, but what's not a simulation is consciousness itself and the quality of intent that it refines, and we get to keep that.  <br>Interviewer: The natural question is: how do we improve the quality of our intent? But before I ask that question, I wanted to just highlight the jest that we're under in some ways because they did this study. If I can take a moment just to share, the parable of the Good Samaritan was shared with two groups of people, and then they tracked them. They were actually meant to like someone needed help on the side of the road, and they were tracking to see whether someone hearing the parable of the Good Samaritan, where someone stops to help somebody, impacted if there was a like interactive awareness—whether they actually stopped to help somebody that needed help on the side of the road or whether they just continued on their way.  <br>The interesting findings of the study were that hearing the parable or not hearing the parable actually made negligible difference. But actually, what made the biggest difference was the sense of urgency that you had—how much of a rush you were in. If you had the time, you'd actually slow down and help, but because you're busy, you don't. You're just like, "Oh, someone else will get it," you know?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: And I just wanted to sort of bring that into light because the kind of conditions of 21st-century living—level of constraint, yeah, that's like a level of constraint. Now you're under a time crunch. Do you help them anyway, even under a time crunch? There's a difference between helping when you're under a time crunch and when you're not. One's easier in general, and one's harder in general.  <br>So I also want to lift up one subtle point here: the quality of intention is not necessarily behavior. It does mean behavior—quality of intention will mean action. Intention means action; it means it. So if you intend to open your hand, you will open your hand. If you intend to help the person next to you, you will help them. Okay? But we're not actually talking about behavior, just technically speaking. We're talking about the real why—the real quality of why you're doing what you're doing. That's what's important. It's a subtle distinction there, but it's meaningful.  <br>Interviewer: Can you elaborate on that a little bit further?  <br>Christian Sundberg: So, we tend to think in the physical that the output is what matters. We measure things—is it measurable? If we can't measure it in the physical, it's like it didn't happen. Quality of intention precedes physical. It works through physical; it works through thoughts; it works through beliefs; it works through physical actions. But it doesn't necessarily mean the action itself. So what I mean is, two people might take the same action—let's say giving $1,000 to a charity. The first person may be doing it so that they can brag about it or so they want to get a tax break or something. The second person might do it without telling anybody, and they really want to help. The second one is an example of pure—I mean, I'm not trying to judge because these things are hard to judge from here—but a pure quality of intention because it's done out of the true desire to help. You know, it's not done if the person is giving away $1,000 in order to brag. Then that's their intention—to seek self-aggrandizement. So it's not the product; it's not the behavior itself. It's the quality—the why—that's what matters.  <br>Interviewer: But then even my question that I asked before was like, how do I upgrade the quality of my intention? Isn't that intention somewhat rooted in grade to want to have better qualities of intention as well?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Okay, so this is a good question, and it's an important question. But I want to just lift up one thing that's kind of dangerous to make the following statement because the ego will get right a hold of this. Okay, so big warning—flashing red letters—ego is going to love this candy. Okay, here we are: you are what is. You are a part of God. Okay? So now I'm lifting that up because you are the thing that is valuable. So wanting to work back towards love and peace and joy and freedom, or to seek greater expression of that, is not necessarily selfish. It's just we are love and peace and freedom, and so wanting to go back towards that is very natural.  <br>Now, I'm saying that with a huge disclaimer at the front because guess what? The ego will take great hold of that. You're like, "Yeah, see, I'm doing this because I deserve it." Look, the other—this is really key too—because at the same breath, we have to say the following: the other is a part of you. Like, you are them; they are you. So serving the other—it's not just like fluffy altruistic nice—it's logical. It makes sense because they are you. You are serving yourself by serving the other, even if you can't see it at the physical level underneath the veiled experience of separation.  <br>Interviewer: That's really helpful. That's really, really helpful. Singing back when underneath here, there's a thread that was left unpicked at, which was there's nothing to forgive. And I think I just want to draw that back into this space. I think now it can really be just cleared further. I think that's beyond profound.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Yeah, okay, so this is one of those statements again—the ego can pretty quickly get a hold of that because now you're free to do anything you want. And you are—you are actually free to do anything you want. Okay? But here's the thing: there's nothing to forgive because we entered into a state of limitation that we're not. We entered into duress, you could say.  <br>It is understood that we have, and in fact, it's respected that we have. It's celebrated that we have. And it seemed that we might make choices that are not optimal. We might make choices out of fear. That is the nature of entering a limitation set. You see, it's the nature of it. So it's all so there's nothing to forgive. If you know that they entered that and then they messed up—well, they entered it knowing they messed up. It'd be like somebody—this is the metaphor—like if someone goes to Mount Everest and they don't make it to the summit because it was too cold and there's no air, do we blame them when they come back down and say, "Man, you screwed up. You really screwed up"? No, no, no. We have so much respect that they did it. We have so much respect that they tried. That's how it is with the human experience or any physical experience, actually. The amount of respect that exists because of the limitations we've taken on is profound.  <br>And when we come back, we self-judge. We don't get it. It's not like the judgment is not like Source saying, "You screwed up." No, the life review is us seeing everything that we actually were. And we can just see what we were because guess what? We then experience how we affected everybody else. We experience it firsthand because they are us. So we experience, "How did I actually affect others when I was under these sets of limitations?" And then we judge, "Oh man." And that's why near-death experiencers say when they're in a life review, it's the guides giving love and support to them. You see, it's not judgment from them to us. It's love and support from them to us because they know we're going to go, "Oh my gosh, I messed up." They know we're going to look at our lives and go, "Oh, I can't believe I did that and I hurt this person in a certain way." But there's nothing to forgive. You see, we're so brave that we came into the set of limitation that we could make that choice.  <br>Now, that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to be loving. No, this is about choosing love. This is not an excuse for the ego to go trump off because you can't escape who you are. If you make egoic choices, then you will face it. You will see that that's who you are. Like in this life, I'm here facing a fear that in a past experience bested me. It crushed me. I've experienced a lot of trauma in this life—a lot of pain. It's not punishment. It's that I have needed to work through it. And I've needed it. It's almost like we don't understand it till we see it firsthand, and then we get to work through it. Yeah, that's an applauded process. It's not a judged process.  <br>Interviewer: And even the reciprocal for what it invites you into—in terms of, you know, often times we harbor judgment against others, and we're seeking an exchange of forgiveness either way, one way or the other. But to transcend that sort of love—to just understand—so harboring judgment for another is a very—I'm sorry to interrupt—harboring judgment for another is a very common ego action because we think we gain some power in judging that person.  <br>Christian Sundberg: No, like what I mean is judging them just makes you feel better for some reason. That's ego. That's not what I'm talking about. That's not true justice. True justice is that all are loved and all are healed—100% healed. Only ego would want less than that for someone else.  <br>Interviewer: Your dialogue on justice kind of blew my mind, to be honest. Can you expand about justice because, yeah, I've never really—  <br>Christian Sundberg: True justice is that love wins, and love is the truth. Amen. The end. And the reason I say it like that is because all—now, I'm not saying there aren't times when we may need a result from an action. Okay? So like if you walk up and punch someone in the face, they might punch you back in the face because that's their choice, and that's just cause—that's cause and effect. And then you learn because now you got some pain. So I'm not saying that we don't learn and that we shouldn't learn. No, we should learn. But what I'm saying is that the Divine—okay, Source—is extremely wise and intelligent. It's not stupid. It's got ridiculously huge amounts of wisdom, knowledge, love for universes and universes worth. So the laws that are set into place are super, super efficient.  <br>And so what I mean is, in the long run—because love is very patient—in the long run, we tend to get the experiences we need to grow past our own limitation and to grow back towards love. And the ultimate justice is that we do. We always return to love. We always return to wholeness and fullness. We are loved. That is the justice. We may temporarily take sojourns into limitations that we can experience how insane love is or fear is so that we don't choose fear anymore. You know, we might have to face it firsthand and suffer, but that's our own unevolvedness. You see, it's not a requirement or something, and it's definitely not a judgment.  <br>Interviewer: Christian, the relationship of the ego—the role of it is—because every spiritual path has its own way of navigating the ego. Some will reject it; some will learn to love it; some see it just to modulate reality and experience. Your awareness of ego in this place amongst the whole thing—  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: So the way I use the term ego, I don't mean the personality portion of the self. Some people use that interchangeably. I don't use those interchangeably because the personality portion of the self doesn't necessarily have to have ego. You can experience being a separate human without an egoic response. You know, you can be love; you can be here; you can be peaceful; you can be free. But ego is just what I describe as the quick part of us that responds in rejection and fear and rises up to grab onto something to make us feel better no matter what it is. It doesn't care. Ego does not care. It just wants to fix the problem.  <br>So now that we feel separate and we feel powerless, here you want—now look, how about this? Have this belief. Oh, look, you're valuable because you belong to this group, or you have worth because you have money, or you have strength because even though you feel powerless, you can be angry at this person, and you can hit them, and now that you've done that, see how powerful you are. <br>See this evidence that you've inflicted something on someone else, and you have strength. See, don't you feel better? That's all ego. It's just the portion of us that is trying to either avoid or disprove the fundamentally negative—like the root negative self-perceptions at the bottom. But they're not even rooted in truth. You see, and the ego's actions don't work ultimately. They may work for a lifetime or even a hundred years or a thousand. They may work for five seconds and then go away. That's because fear is challenging—practically speaking, fear is challenging to work through. We could say very simply, fear is the only hard thing. There's no other hard thing.  <br>And the ego is just the part of us that's really trying to fix the problem of fear until we really go in there, look at it, and process it. And then the ego evaporates. It doesn't—we don't need that anymore. Like for instance, if you know that you're a super powerful being, and someone flicks you off on the road, you don't need to feel angry. It doesn't make sense because you're not powerless. You see?  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, it's interesting. It's almost like a trigger pin cushion in some way—the part of us gets triggered. It's really interesting.  <br>I had a question about senses. I'm not sure where it fit into today's dialogue, but I want to ask—  <br>Christian Sundberg: Go ahead and ask it.  <br>Interviewer: Which was because our five senses seem to be—we've talked a lot about emotions and feelings and intention as well, which kind of lives pre-senses, but yeah, we've got our five senses. Do you see them as something that are like conduits which sort of relay information?  <br>Christian Sundberg: No, see, are they like actually anchoring us to Maya?  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, like yeah.  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Well, they are anchoring us to Maya in the sense that we pay attention to them. So senses just mean sense data. So I'm lifting that up because it's not actually like you—I know this sounds crazy—but you don't actually have eyeballs. You're having the experience of having eyeballs. There's a difference.  <br>And so what I mean is—and no, let's even take a step further because it's not even technically the experience of having eyeballs. It's the experience of the idea of having eyes and the experience of the visual image of a face and the experience of light coming through those eyes depending on their health and status of health and then having a visual form experience happening on and in consciousness on and in your awareness. That's what senses are. <br>And they root us to the physical and to the Maya because we pay so close attention to them. It's like the movie metaphor again—we're staring at the movie screen. We're staring at the senses. There's a great Seth quote from the Seth Speaks books where he says something like, "Physical reality is like a bright point of light that you just never look away from, but you can." I've experienced that when you first start down the path of meditation, you can't—I mean, practically speaking, you generally can't locate that right away. But eventually, as you go down that path and really investigate your consciousness beneath thoughts and beneath sense data, there is a beautiful unfolding that can take place in which you realize, "Oh my gosh, I am not the sense data. I am the spacious awareness that the sense data is arising within."  <br>Interviewer: Christian, you wrote a book—"A Walk in the Physical." How is it—you've actually made it available for people to just come check out. They don't have to pay for it. Can you tell us a little bit about the book and even just why—like what prompted you to write it, how it felt writing it, and where people can access it?  <br>Christian Sundberg: Sure. So the book is called "A Walk in the Physical," and my website is awalkinthephysical.com. The book is available to be read online for free at the third link down on my book page. It's not about money. I just want to share the information. You know, I want us to remind each other of who we really are so we can use this experience to its fullest.  <br>And really, the book arrived to me intuitively in chunks over six years. And it's a reality model, really. It really speaks to what is the human experience—what are we doing here, and why is love so important, and how can we know our true nature so that we can face fear and process it. That's really what the book is. It's nonlinear, kind of references itself throughout, but I felt called that that was the way it needed to be presented. And yeah, it's been very well received. I mean, it's in print, Kindle, and audiobook, and yeah, it's been very widely received. I'm really humbled by that.  <br>Interviewer: And I wanted to ask—so 30 years ago—sorry, when you were 30 years old—years ago, I'm dating you pretty hard there—no problem. But when you were 30 years old, you were practicing meditation. We were just talking about meditation—you're talking about the exploration of the interiors and what's possible there and staring at that point of white light. But can you describe a little bit around—yeah, just your relationship—not just your relationship with meditation, but is it a specific technique that you feel really robust for you in terms of approaching meditation for those that are tuning in and interested in going inwards?  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: Sure. Well, first of all, I very highly recommend meditation as a practice. It is extremely full of treasure, even if it does not immediately appear obvious. I very much recommend it. I do recommend an exercise in part four of my book that worked for me. The closest term I think to what it would be called would be Transcendental Meditation, but I'm not sensitive to the type or term because meditation is not really an action process. <br>It starts as that. It's really a shift in intention. It's a shift in focus, and that may happen through form, through a mantra, through thoughts, through a process, and that's okay. But it actually transcends that. It's actually more about what are you as consciousness doing? Can you take the time in the midst of your busy day and put down everything and just focus on something neutral for 40 minutes as an example? Can you do that? See, that's a choice. That's an intention to do that.  <br>And when you use your intention in such a way, it actually changes the momentum of how the form arrives to you. You don't know you're doing that. You're not trying to do that. In fact, you're not trying to do anything except very alertly investigate what you are beneath thought. You're just experiencing with full alertness. You're not trying to do anything, but as you do that, the momentum of thoughts that may arrive to you slows, and clarity arises. It may even arise later after you're not meditating. <br>All of a sudden, you may just have this moment of like, "Wow, clarity or peace may just rise up," and it's so beautiful. And it's the peace that you've always been seeking, and you didn't even know why. And it's so tasty that the ego is immediately like, "Oh my gosh, I got to get that back. How do I grab that? Grab, grab, grab. What was the process? What I got to do that again?" That's what the ego does.<br>It's because, wow, it's what we're looking for is that peace. But that peace is so valuable, and it empowers us to then go into our physical lives and make choices that are more from that place. We're more empowered. You see, we're not lost so much in the small stories anymore. We're much more our full selves experiencing the stories, experiencing the body, and that's okay. That's good. That's very empowering. It's freeing.  <br>Interviewer: Yeah, thank you for clarifying. And yeah, just the—I guess just to wrap up the question, which is—it's hard not to be in awe when I'm following, tuning in to the reality models, the work that you're sharing, just the probabilities, you know, because everything is probabilistic, you know, and just the fact that you know we get to share in a conversation like this, let alone being incarnate, let alone just all the infinite possibilities, and you sort of collapse possibility into probability, and then probability—but like probabilistically, this is just so off the charts, and then you're having the experience, and you're like, "Wow, you know, it's just hard not to be in awe of everything you're sharing." I just wanted to get a moment from you on just the probability stacked on the probability to the nth degree and like just what life—  <br><br><br>Christian Sundberg: No, it's miraculous. Yeah, it's miraculous that we arrive to this moment, that we've done this crazy of a thing—this physical thing—all the way to this moment after thousands of years of choice-making and evolution. We're at this moment. It's pretty amazing.  <br>And when we say that, it feels amazing. Of course, it's not me or you. What we're saying is we tap in a little bit to the truth. We feel a little bit of the grandeur, the love. When we tap into that intuitively, we go, "Oh my gosh, I recognize that," and then we're reminded, "I'm not actually the human. Holy crap." And that is what's so important about this kind of conversation—is lifting up that we are multi-dimensional beings of love and peace and freedom and joy. And what cooler thing is there to do than to do that here with each other and to remind each other even in the crazy dense physical of who we really are and to know that we can use this however we wish and that we have absolutely nothing to fear. What is more amazing than that?  <br>Interviewer: So that's why I have so much respect for your work. I appreciate all that you've done. Thank you so much for having me on today, brother Christian. Thank you so much for sharing yourself so abundantly here with us today. I know I've taken up just so many questions that you've just had the great—and I think back to the point that you described—it's so hard to point the finger and explain and put words even into like everything we've discussed, and yet you do an amazing, incredible job of putting it so eloquently. It is such a blessing to receive. <br>So I want to thank you for your time and energy here today, of course, and yeah, also you know so many of your own challenges and everything that you've navigated—like your own incarnation in the fears and just speaking to that from such a deep place of authenticity, just sharing that with us. Like, thank you for writing the book, giving it away freely. Just had really, really so much love and respect for the way you share yourself to the world. Thank you.<br>I've appreciated the energy of what you offer. Like I said, I mean, we focus a lot on the physical while we're here, but the real arena of change is consciousness. It's through the mind. You see, so freeing people through the mind is the most powerful, important service we could do, and it precedes all the physical stuff. Like today's the election unit—that's but all is consciousness. We will change the systems. We will change the voting. We will do that once we ourselves change. So I'm just lifting that up because yeah, that's important.<br>Inspired soul, you made it through to the end of another incredible episode of Inspired Evolution. Yes, for our life, but then also transcending lifetime, space, dimensions—goodness, such an incredibly rich conversation with Christian. I feel so blessed to partake in it and to share it here with you. Thank you so much for tuning in, and thank you all also that are subscribed to the channel.

He remembers his life pre-birth, his in-between lives, and how he chose to come here and choose the family he was part of and the person and life he was going to live. When Christian was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While he forgot that for most of his adult life, it spontaneously returned 13 years ago when he took up a meditation practice. He also began to have out-of-body experiences. <br>Professionally, he has a really normal job. He's worked for 16 years as a project manager for complex nuclear pump manufacturing projects and also for an insurance company. Christian is the author of the book A Walk in the Physical, which attempts to describe the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey. I met Christian at the IONS conference (International Association for Near-Death Studies). This is a really unique episode with a really unique story.<br>Hey everyone, I'm really excited to let you know about the Science and Spirituality Salon I'm now hosting. During these intimate events, a scientifically verified psychic medium will give all of you readings, and I will give a talk on the science and evidence that changed my mind about an afterlife. This will also be an amazing opportunity to get to meet some of you in person or virtually and to share more about all the science and data that transformed my worldview and got me through my worst days.<br>These can be hosted in your home, in a nearby cafe with a private room, or they can even be virtual. I've hosted a few already, and they were really special, fascinating, emotional, and evidential. So if you're interested in getting a small group together over dinner, brunch, drinks, or coffee to learn more about the science and to get evidential medium readings, send me an email at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:hello@WTFhappen.net" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:hello@WTFhappen.net" target="_blank">hello@WTFhappen.net</a> and put "Science and Spirituality" in the title.<br>Welcome to What the F Just Happened. I'm your host, Liz Enton. If you listened to the intro, you know my story. If not, here's a brief summary: I'm a sciency skeptic, and when my dad died, I took a shot in the dark and decided to investigate if there was any possible evidence of an afterlife. I assumed that was as realistic as Santa Claus, but I was desperate. However, I was so blown away by what I discovered that I wrote a book and launched this podcast. In this podcast, I'll be talking to some fairly normal people about some really weird stuff. I speak with everyone from psychic mediums and afterlife researchers to ordinary people who've had some inexplicable experiences. So come listen. There's no need to draw any final conclusions. Keep an open mind and wonder, "What the F just happened?"<br>Hi, I am speaking now with Christian Sundberg. He is an author, and we met at the IONS conference. He has a really unique story, and I have honestly never heard it before from anyone else, so I am so happy to have him on. So, Christian, introduce yourself, tell us the name of your book, and why a touch about what happened.<br>Yeah, thank you. Thanks for having me on the show. It was wonderful to meet you in DC. My whole family enjoyed it very much. So, in the human context, my name is Christian Sundberg. My body is 43 years old right now. I've worked professionally in the nuclear field for 16 years and now in insurance as a project manager. But I've had some really impactful personal spiritual experiences, non-physical experiences, including pre-birth memory returning to me. I remember choosing this incarnation and why. So, I didn't share that for about eight years. That memory returned around the age of 30.<br>I didn't share it because it's just the kind of thing you don't talk about, but I did end up publishing a book, not primarily about the experience but more about what the human experience is, what are we doing here on Earth. The book is called A Walk in the Physical because we are just here having a walk, having a journey and experience. The book was spirit-led. I felt chunks of it come to me intuitively over a period of about six years. I never once sat down and said, "Okay, I'm going to write a book now." That was never how it worked. It was just like intuitive guidance and guidance and guidance, and I was like, "I just got to get this down." Even the way it's organized was very spirit-led.<br>It's available for free on my website. It's not about money. I just want to share the message of what we really are, who we are here on Earth. I'm very, very passionate about that because our true nature is one of joy and freedom and love, and there's nothing to fear. We just really need to remind each other of that while we're here so deep in the play. I think we do have a lot of fear here, especially around death. The more evidence we can get that it's not the end, especially for left-brainers like me, that's so helpful.<br><br><br>So, I want to ask you first of all, there's so much to get into about this, but what led to this memory coming up in the first place of your before this life and between lives? Because I know we'll go into this further, but just to clarify, this is not your first human life, correct?<br>Correct. Yeah, so okay, that's a great question. So, up until the age of 30, I had no memory of this at all. When I was a very small child, I had some of this pre-birth memory, but it quickly left me by the age of like five or six. So, between the ages of five or six and 30, I had no memory of this at all. I saw the world through a very Lutheran Christian lens, but I was always a seeker. I came across the work of the physicist Tom Campbell. He's a consciousness explorer and has had many out-of-body experiences. I began to—can I just ask, is he the one who's the author of My Big TOE?<br>Yes, My Big TOE, my big theory of everything. That's right.<br>Yes, yes, okay. I love him as well. Okay, sorry, make sure it's the same Tom Campbell. Go on.<br>He encourages you to take up a meditation practice and to just very objectively go see what you are beneath thoughts, beneath thinking. So, at first, I just began and continued the meditation because it felt good. It felt relieving to have some relief from thinking. But after a few months, I had my first non-physical experience, and it was so eye-opening and shocking that I was like, "Oh my gosh, I just need to keep going down this path." So, I continued to meditate, and at some point, I'm not sure exactly when, but within the first year, probably a few months after that, the pre-birth memory was just there. It was the most normal thing in the world. It was like somebody had just blown leaves off of the ground, and there was the grass. It was like even more normal than the human experience that I was having. It was just much more personal and close to me than the human experience.<br>So, yeah, it sounds like this great revelation, and sure, the content is very rich and deep and personal, but not strange, very natural. So, you said before this memory came up of your pre-birth experiences, you had a non-physical experience that you thought was shocking. What was that? What happened?<br>Yeah, so in brief, I was having a dream, a normal dream, and then in this dream, this wave was going to come over and crush me. I told myself, "Okay, you're going to die now. Let go of the body." But then I woke up, even though my body didn't wake up. I woke up in this state of incredibly strong vibrations and sounds. It sounded like someone had parked a jet engine on either side of my head, and it was so freaking loud. It was louder than anything I'd ever heard on Earth. The vibrations were so strong; it felt like I was being shaken, like I was strapped to an engine. It was just so strong, and I was stuck there for maybe 15 or 20 long seconds, terrified. Then, when it finally ended, I jumped out of bed, sweating, and I was freaked out. I was like, "What the heck was that?" It was not subtle. It was scary, intense, but it was just like the first taste. It was like I had begun to touch other layers of being, other reality data streams, as Tom Campbell would put it. That can be experienced like strong static at first. But anyway, at the time, I didn't understand. I just knew, "Oh my gosh, that was really real. I have to keep going and investigating." So, I just kept going down the path, and since then, I've had a number of out-of-body experiences. It's very, very real, even more real than this Earth, very normal too.<br>It's so interesting you talk about the vibrations and the sounds because there's so much consistency in that. First of all, the vibrations—I've had people who've had NDEs talk about that. Their episodes will be out at some point, and people have talked about that. A lot of meditators, and I had an experience—if you read my book, you know I had this weird experience just early starting this where I felt all these waves, and then that sound you talked about, that's similar to what a lot of people hear when they have out-of-body experiences right before they go out of body, correct? Am I right in that?<br>Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's very common actually. I didn't know it at the time. It just scared the crap out of me at the time.<br>So, it scared you. You didn't love it.<br>No, I didn't love it at that first moment. It didn't matter. My curiosity was greater than any fear it might have provoked because it was so real. So, I didn't keep meditating in order to have more experiences. That's not really how it worked for me. I just realized that by deeply coming to know what I really am, my consciousness itself, there were larger parts of me that just naturally would arrive. That's just the easiest way I can put it.<br><br><br>I'm going to ask you, and then I'm going to ask you about your experience of your pre-birth, in-between lives memory, but first, I'm going to ask you—you kept saying all this was actually really normal. What do you mean by that? Because if people hearing this for the first time might not say it's normal. I know it doesn't sound normal. I'm a normal guy, I promise, though I know it sounds really strange. What I mean is that—oh, this is difficult to speak to, and I want to just disclaim before we get into these topics that language is just incredibly insufficient. There's just no way to use earthly language to speak to our higher natures or for the higher realms from which we come because our language is based in our local world. It's based in form and symbol and all the assumptions of Earth that we just take for granted, like linear time, the discreet location. We really believe in those things. Our language is based on them and in them, but our higher nature precedes all of that context. So, it's almost impossible to speak about these things using language.<br>So, that being said, I can at least say that as we very simply—but not simply—but it's more difficult than it might seem on the human level, underneath all the levels of what we're not, underneath all the human story, our consciousness itself is already something. You could say that the you that feels like you to you is the most natural thing for you, and then that you has become wrapped up within the story of form, the story of the human condition, the human life. That's not really what you are. It's actually just kind of like a big virtual reality that you're deeply, deeply engaged in. So, that's what I mean like it's more normal because when you actually let go of all that, you're not letting go of the thinking, letting go of the judgments and the conditioning and the story, and you just dwell fully in the aliveness that you are, then what arises within that is very natural, very normal. And it can actually be seen that the experience of being separate, apparently separate, which is what the human experience is like—we experience separation rather deeply here, extremely deeply here. That's like the name of the game is to feel separate from each other. That is the actually the alien state of being by comparison.<br>I'm going to have more questions about that after, but first, what happened when you remembered this between lives experience? Or actually, you remembered before your very first life on Earth, am I correct? And then you also remember between lives. So, what did you remember? I guess we'll start linearly, even though apparently linear time isn't real, but we'll start with your first memory pre-birth life as a human.<br>Yeah, I've shared this a number of times, so I won't go into the full detail. It's a story that I've shared on a number of podcasts, but I'll just say that before I had ever incarnated, I came across a being who had incarnated. Okay, so this is like really difficult to speak to because then people want to know, "Okay, where were you? What was the environment? What did everything look like?" I'm happy to try to speak to some of that, but I'll just at least summarize very simply and say that I was in a different reality system at the time that looked like an environment of living light. I was and am that light too, and so is everybody else. I'm connecting with them, and when you engage with another being in that context, it's like a telepathic exchange. It's not words because separation is not a thing.<br>I could feel from this being the intense quality of his nature. He was full of so much power and joy and peace and freedom, and his evolution was just off the charts. I don't know how to describe this, and I was just very, very deeply inspired by who he was, what he was. I asked him, "How did you do this? How are you this?" And I asked, "Do you feel as much freedom and power as I feel that you feel?" And he shared, "Yes," and he allowed me to feel through and into him. And I asked, "How did you do that?" And one of the things he showed me was that he had lived a physical life where he had suffered a long-term health condition. He had suffered pain and ailment, and the way that he chose to meet that experience, process that experience, the way that his spirit met it and utilized it, allowed this incredible refinement of his being. And I was like, "Oh my gosh, I want to do that. I want to do that. I'm going to do that." And at first, he communicated something like, "Yeah, that's what they all say," not in a negative way, but kind of like, "You just don't understand how hard this can be." And I was like, "No, I mean it. I want to do it."<br>So, that was before I was ever had a physical incarnation, and since then, I've had many experiences. I ended up finding this being later and sharing with him that I was on the path. So, I don't know if that speaks to your initial question, but that's just a quick summary.<br>Yes, I have some more from it. So, when you ran into this being again, did you ever run into him on Earth?<br>I have no idea. I'm still like super veiled. I'm still a veiled being right now while I'm in the human condition. So, I mean, it's possible, but keep in mind, I don't want to get too far out in the woo weeds here, but keep in mind that Earth is not the only incarnation opportunity. So, you know, I know that he was physical, but it's a very big universe, and there's more than one universe even. It's a very huge multi-dimensional context. So, I have no idea if I've ever encountered the being here on Earth. I don't know. I mean, it makes sense. There's plenty of other planets. Even NASA, traditional science, is finding other Goldilocks planets, and we already know this galaxy, let alone the whole universe, is filled with them. And you said multiverse—you think there's other universes?<br>Yes, I do.<br>So, everyone isn't completely lost. What do you mean by veiled?<br>Yeah, so what I mean by veiled—this is a really important concept. Your consciousness precedes the human experience. So, that consciousness, its native state, is to be connected to all things and to know that connection and feel that connection all the time. So, if you imagine an ocean of water, you're like a drop in the ocean. So, your native state is to be one with the ocean, and you're still you. You're still a drop. You're individuated, but you're also one with the ocean, and that oneness is known and felt. What I mean is, in this state, you have access to all knowing, all data. You're capable of so much more than what we perceive here on Earth. So, in order to have the very specific and limited and dense experience of being human, you have to accept what we call very simply the veil, which just means a set of constraints in consciousness space that go along with having the incarnation experience.<br><br><br>Do you remember the experience of how that veil was put on you? Is that something you're okay to share?<br>Yeah, so accepting the veil was like surrendering to a plummet in vibration. This is really hard to describe, but imagine your body—but not your physical body—your body of awareness, the body that feels like your physical body, but it's really your consciousness connected to everything and existing in an extremely high vibration state. And then having a cloak of veil put upon you that you surrender to, surrender into, and accept. And then through doing that, there's this plummet and vibration down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, more lower, more lower, all the way down into this extremely dense state of being. And in that process, all knowing is erased, cut off—not actually erased, but you feel like it's erased. All of your connectedness, all of your remembrance, all that active knowing is veiled, is cut off. And that is precisely the value of the physical experiences that we come into. We have that experience of being just the human from the limited point of view with no memory, no memory of anything else.<br>So, when does this veil go on? Is this when you're a baby or so?<br>Yeah, so we're never actually a baby. I know that sounds okay, so the physical—think of the physical like a simulation that's running on its own, and then we interject into it and assume the role of a given perspective, a given body. So, in my case, I accepted the veil before this body was born, so while it was still in the womb of my mother. So, surrendering to the veil occurred, and then there was this plummet, and then I was in the womb. And then I almost rejected the experience actually because I was like, "I am not doing this. This vibration is so low. I'm not doing this." But I ended up sticking with it because the spirit came to me and encouraged me, showed me again who I really am. So, that occurred. I don't know when in the pregnancy, but I can at least say that after that happened, it felt like I was in the womb for a long time before a physical birth actually happened. And then I do remember—I have some short, brief, shocking memories of the day I was born physically in this life.<br>Right, and I know some of those memories were verified, but first, which you have to explain, but first, I do want to ask you—you said the veil blocks all memories, but it didn't for you, and it doesn't in some of the cases that, say, Dr. Jim Tucker has researched on cases of kids with past life memories and some in-between lives memories. So, why does it not?<br>Okay, so I'm not special first of all. So, I remember though, in my pre-birth experience, asking, "Can I have like a tiny bit of memory this time? I don't want to forget everything. I want to just have a little tiny bit of memory." And they said, "I, the guides, said I could do that." But I knew that that would make this life more challenging, more difficult because then the contrast is even greater. If there's any recollection of home, there's like this homesickness that gets introduced that's extreme, very extreme.<br>Okay, so the veil is very effective. It's super effective. It works, but on the other hand, the short answer to your question is the soul—each one of our souls is so huge and vast and complex and powerful. I mean, basically, to put it very in crude terms, you are a piece of God. Okay, so what can truly veil God? Well, only God's surrendering God's self can veil God. That's why we have to surrender ourselves into the veil. There's no way for you to be veiled any other way. Even though we surrender ourselves, we are still on the other side right now. So, it's not that there's like unfairness or something. It's more like each soul is so unique, and each veil is unique and organic and specific to that soul. Each life is unique, each body is unique, each context is unique, the history of every soul is unique. So, with all that uniqueness and all that richness, it's natural that some are there's going to be some breaks in the simulation. The veracity is maintained as best as possible, but you're going to have, especially as we awaken, which means especially as we increase the vibration of our consciousness towards what we really are, that it would become more and more because the vibrational distance is decreasing slowly. And as that distance decreases, it becomes more readily available to have some snippets of memory or awareness of who we really are.<br>And I don't think they've done this, but I'm so curious, and I wish they would—that you've never had your brain scanned, and people who have more pre-birth memories, there isn't some difference in your brains that have been discovered there?<br>Okay, you haven't participated in that.<br>Okay, and I'm going to ask a quick question. You use the word God, and I just—I'm curious what you mean by that because the only God I understood was like the biblical one, which is why I just never believed in anything like a god. So, when you say God, I'm assuming you don't mean the single sort of ding consciousness that tells—okay, so it's just a word, and I know that it's a loaded word. I personally don't mind that term, but I recognize it has a lot of baggage too. So, okay, so the word—oh my gosh, it points to something that is so far beyond language. I can't even possibly begin to speak to it. You could say metaphorically God is the source of all that is, the one ocean—ocean with a capital O—the great I Am presence of all things, the one true knower of which you are a part. So, that's not a dude. That's not a dude in the sky. It's being itself but also the most personal, loving wholeness of being. It's like, for each of us, it's like our dearest friend and our most poignant love and our parent. Yeah, it's like the truest relation. It's a relationship that's the closest to all of us actually.<br>Yeah, that's really interesting and probably something we can't fully understand as humans, correct?<br>Yeah.<br><br><br>And you said you had memory of your birth, and it was—I know that you also mentioned that was verified in your book. You mentioned that. I'm also just going to say because you said you've gone into a lot more details other places—Christian's book, he goes into a lot more of these details, so get his book. It's really good. It's also audiobooks. You can listen, you can read it. So, I just wanted to give you a little plug because I love your book. So, of course, but yeah, so tell us about your memory of your birth. The only verification I think that you're mentioning is later in my life, I drew the birth room for my mother, and she verified that that was where the objects in the room were located. Like, I remember where the bed was, where the heating grate was, the window, where the doctor was standing. It's just one image memory, and in this image, I was like up away from the bed. <br>So, I know they say babies can't see, so I don't really understand how I've seen this, but I remember seeing it. I remember the color of the paint on the heating grate. So, I mean, so that's, you know, is that formal verification? No, you know, it's subjective. It's close to home. I don't feel a need to prove it, but I've had other forms of verification though with experiential verification. Sometimes, if I have a non-physical experience with someone, I will really do my best when I'm interacting with them non-physically to try to confirm it and prove it that we've interacted that once, you know, we're here once we're doing the physical awake thing. And I've had probably half a dozen successes. I've had at least as many failures where the individual doesn't remember the interaction, but I've had some confirmations that were definitely good enough for me at least. And at least one while I was awake where I mentioned this briefly before we began recording, but I was interacting with a woman who I know that I know non-physically. I've never met her personally, and I had an interaction with her that I was able to confirm at least to my own satisfaction.<br>And what would you say is the most mind-blowing verified experience you've had that maybe someone who's very skeptical, especially someone who's in a lot of grief or maybe facing their own mortality, they might really love?<br>Well, I can at least share the example that I was just mentioning, and I will in a moment, but let me just point out that okay, so I am all for verification. I'm all for skepticism. We need to remain both open-minded but also skeptical and investigate with as much objectivity as possible. The truth stands up to all scrutiny. So, that's good. But I also want to point out, however, that the truest verification is your own personal experience of it. The truest evidence won't be an external like someone showed me a new object or told me a new story. It will be a knowing and experience yourself. Like, when I've been out of body and seen the color of the sky in a certain environment that is more colorful than anything on Earth—with that much lucidity and feeling my connectedness to it, it's so self-evidently real. It's off the charts. Like, it doesn't need you to come back to this comparatively black and white movie on Earth and say, "Oh, is that real?" No, no, no. You know it. You really know it. And that personal knowing, that personal experience, that's the real evidence.<br>So, is one quick comment to that—so I really lift up meditation as a practice, not so that you can have these amazing experiences. No, that's not the goal. Rather, I encourage that you go just very objectively investigate what your own consciousness is beneath thought. So, don't make anything up, no new stories, no new ideas. I know your thinking mind is going to go into overdrive. I want to give you some new ideas, and what are the new ideas I can think about? No, no, just put all that aside and actually go experientially with full alertness. Go investigate every day for 30 or 40 minutes, set every day for months. Don't judge it even for three or four months. Investigate experientially what is my awareness, what is my consciousness beneath thought. And I recommend an exercise in part four of my book to get started with that process if anyone is interested.<br>Okay, so that was a long tangent, but I think that's important because as soon as we talk about verification, we tend to think in our local thinking minds context, "Show me the evidence." Well, I'll at least share this brief story. So, this woman that I had interacted with online, I just sensed intuitively that her and I were like soul family. Like, I just knew her really well. So, I went for a walk at work one day out up a road, and I had this interaction with her higher—I know this sounds crazy, this is getting into the woo field, but this is what happened. I had this interaction with her, and I felt her send this like energy down my back, and it was very healing. And I remember her communicating, "This is a gift," and I said, "Thank you very much." It's really interesting. Wow. <br>And then I remember her nudging, "You see that piece of moss on the ground in front of you? Pick that up, take it back to your desk, and go tell my human—the me, you know, me that's playing the human—that you found this piece of moss in the context of you receiving this energetic gift from me." I'm like, "Okay, this is crazy. Okay, I'll be the crazy guy." So, I took the moss back to my desk at work, messaged this woman on Facebook, and I said, "I explain what happened," and she said, "I kid you not, last night I said to my husband, 'The perfect example of a gift that someone could give me would be a piece of moss.'" So, that kind of thing to me is verification. That's verification to me. Does anybody else have anybody else? <br>I mean, they didn't see that. It's not on paper. It's not like a thousand scientists can go study that or something. There are many studies out there of similar research, but for me, that's the kind of thing that now it no longer is strange. You know, when I have a verified confirmed interaction, that's not strange at all to me. I've become very familiar with feeling because I'm a very left-brain person too. You know, I'm a project manager of 20 years. I worked in the nuclear industry for 16 years, and that's just how my mind has historically worked. However, the deeper parts of ourselves, the intuitive portions, they actually know a lot more. When you're willing to be humble enough to put aside the intellect and actually go see what's actually down there, through that, I have felt the living connection I've had with others in ways that have been confirmed, and it's really beautiful.<br>I'm going to just tell a slightly verification-ish story, and I—for me, things get verification when you talk, you hear more and more stories again and again similar to what Christian shared, and you meet people like you, you know, Christian, who are really normal people, and it just happens more and more. And I think the body of evidence comes together to give us so much—I mean, more than just hope. But it was funny, I was watching Christian's talk during the IONS conference, and I was like, "Oh, I completely know him," like without a doubt, just the way you know you see someone you haven't seen in like six years that you worked with or 10 years ago from—I don't know how old anyone is, but you know, 10 years ago or school or whatever, and you're like, "I would see a person forever." <br>So, I'm watching him talk, I was like, "Oh yeah, he did this talk for a forever family webinar, and I help on the behind the scenes." So, I was like, "I know Christian." Then I said to him, "We both, you know, I went up and introduced myself and said that I have this podcast, What the F Just Happened, and would like him to come on." And he's like, "Oh yeah, I know you." And I said, "Yeah, you did the webinar for forever family." No, he didn't. So, I was like, "Oh, we, but I like, I know him. I've seen this talk. I've met him at parties, and I saw him on the afterparty one night at the IONS conference." And I said, "Oh, you must know this friend of mine. <br>Did we do a podcast together with him?" No, I, you know, he had to go. His whole family is there. He has fairly young children. I'm looking through, I think I found your LinkedIn or Facebook or something, but I was like, "Oh, you know what, I've got to figure this out because it was really bothering me, like no doubt I knew him." And he said, "No doubt he knew me." I was like, "Maybe did he used to work in the photography or videographer? <br>Maybe we knew each other when I used to work in fashion during a fashion week event, and you know, we photo shoot." No logical reason we've ever met each other, and Christian said he absolutely knew me, and I was like, "Okay, this is so weird. What if I like knew him between lives? Let me play with the evidence of this." And I brought that up before we start recording, Christian was like, "Oh yeah, yeah, no." So, that was—I mean, I sensed it before, you know, when you came up to—we were so, um, for the listeners, we went to the IONS party that one night in Washington, DC, met all sorts of amazing people, and you know, you and I got to have a conversation, and I just knew. I was really in the zone, the meditative state, and I was like, "Oh yeah, I definitely know you. I mean, you're like, yeah, from something." I'm like, "No, no, before this, obviously. Like, I mean, to me, it's obvious that there was, you know, there's relationship there." See, but that's how like so many of us—a lot of us have relationships, and we just don't remember it, or we come across each other, and we just feel some connection. It's deeper than that. I don't know what the specifics are. I'm not quick to jump on them. You know, I'm like, I remain skeptical too. It's important to keep that skepticism, but I also know, you know, my intuitive—I know, you know, when I know somebody. And so, yeah, it's not strange to me.<br>Yeah, so, um, yeah, so that was very an interesting experience. So, I'm going to actually—I want to know that or see what you have to say about this. What is life like on the other side? Sometimes it sounds like it'd be really boring. Just, oh, you're just in a sea of love. Not that love's not great, but like, it sounds like being at a spa, which is great for three days, but being in a spa for 10 years, I'd want to—I'd be so miserable. So, it sounds very boring. Is there purpose or friendship? Okay, what is it like?<br>I love this question. Okay, so the question is a little bit like let's say you and I are playing Minecraft together or playing a video game together, and we play Minecraft for years, and then you say to me in Minecraft one day, "Well, what's it like outside of Minecraft? It sounds so boring. There is so much to do on Earth outside of Minecraft. How could you possibly describe that to someone in Minecraft?" Similarly, the limitations that we experience while we're human are off the charts. <br>They're so high. So, when you take away those limitations, the native nature of spirit, of consciousness, is so creative and so powerful and so free that the possibilities for experience are unfathomably vast, way more than we can even imagine within the human mind. So, the other side is not just one place. It's not like one loading screen, and that's it, and then this is the real place. No, this is actually like the not real place, and there are many, many different reality systems that all have their own rules and their own purposes. And I only have awareness of some, and there's some that I felt guided not to share too much about, which is fine. I just can say at least that there is a multi-dimensional scope that is beyond imagining, and it's not boring.<br>It may be true that I will say at least though that when we exist in that very free state, there is a certain something that the limitation set of being physical provides that we don't get anywhere else. Like, a certain challenge that seems to be missing. So, you might say, like as a metaphor, let's say you work out every day, and you go to the gym, and you're in great shape, and then you stop working out for a couple of weeks. You just might crave going back to the gym. Now, in this case, it's not like the gym has something to offer that we don't already natively have. You know, we already are everything we need. We don't need anything. We don't need to do anything. Being is already whole. Yet, evolution occurs. Evolution is happening. Evolution meaning the expansion of love and joy. So, we may choose to re-engage this physical experience, or we may choose a great many other experiences.<br>I can also say very generally speaking that most other reality systems are thought-responsive. So, that is our intention and our thoughts immediately have an effect. That actually happens here on Earth too, but it's a lot slower. It's like ridiculously slow. So, there are a lot of different options, and you, I guess, universes, dimensions with different laws. The way here we have laws—I can't jump a thousand feet in the air. It takes X amount of hours to get from point A to point B. Every space in this reality—yeah, you can't go directly somewhere. <br>Right, right. And if I want a certain object, somebody has to physically make it. You can't just think it, and it will appear. So, those are the laws. That's right. Yeah, just like video games might have different rules. You know, you can play one video game, and you might play another one, and that has completely different rules, different story, different context, different character. Maybe there's no character. You know, maybe it's Pong. Whatever. There are reality systems of experience that are very different, but they all have their own rules of some kind, and ours just happen to be at the very far end of the high limitation spectrum. So, you can think of our reality at the far end.<br><br> Where the discussion explores the concept of transcending duality and the nature of reality and consciousness.<br>Okay, so we transcend all duality. So, I'm not trying to make it sound like duality is fundamentally true or real. It's not, but experientially within the realms of what is duality—duality meaning the experience of this and not that, up and not down, hot and not cold, dark and not light, you know, this shape and not that shape, this is an apple and not a pear. Very meaning that we think here and then the other side, and there's one this up, this experience, and then the other, and those are the only two in all of consciousness. But that's—there's limitless types and states of—I don't know if it's limitless, but it's extremely huge at least. <br>But yes, right, yes. Um, it is yes. So, we perceive reality from within the lens of duality that we learned. You know, so like we learn discreet location. That's a really big one to us. You're over there; I'm over here. And that's just—and then if I want to go somewhere else, I got to move my body between every intermittent space to get there. That is specific to our reality. Like, it's so obvious to us, and it's so like assumed. So, usually when we ask about the other side, we're like, "Okay, tell me about the places. Tell me about the environments. Tell me about the objects. What does it look like? I want to tell me the visual because I understand that." <br>And there are those things in higher systems. In fact, they're even more real. The sensory experience is even more rich and real there. However, spirit is not primarily made of form. That any of these shapes or symbols or experiences—spirit transcends all form. Um, and we just engage it and utilize it for the growth of being. It's like a huge play or a game that we utilize form, and this reality just happens to be super, super limiting and super dense. And it's kind of like going into outer space in an astronaut's space suit or going to Mount Everest maybe or something like that. It's extreme.<br>And so, are we the most dense, or are there denser or more difficult planets or realms?<br>Yeah, so to my experience, this reality, this universe, is the most dense, limiting type of universe. But also, keep in mind that really what ends up becoming dense is the vibration of consciousness itself when it associates into something like the physical universe. It's not okay. It's we veil into a very defined, extreme set of limitations. That's the physical universe. But then when we're here, we apply the meaning. And so, when the meaning that we apply is converse to our true nature, that ends up being an extreme negative, hellish type low vibration experience. Hellish, low vibration type experiences can happen here. They can also happen in thought-responsive reality systems if we're really deep into fear and actualizing fear. Fear is—you could just say fear is hell, whether it's here or in another environment. Whereas our true nature is total love and peace and joy, and there's nothing to fear in it.<br>So, I went kind of around in a circle there, but yes, this is the most limiting type of experience that I'm aware of. And I was aware of that in my pre-birth experience that this was like, "Wow, off the charts."<br>And are there other planets and solar systems and galaxies in this reality?<br>Yes, and they each have their own vibration. You know, they each have their own context. You could say the human collective consciousness has its own color or its own sound or its own temperature. You could say, and so the human collective consciousness is one pond within a much larger ocean. It's a very exciting pond, super, super interesting, super tantalizing opportunity. Wow, get your hands dirty. You know, play in the mud, kindergarten or junior high type experience. You know, that's Earth by comparison to some of the other systems, but very unique, very precious. In fact, being given the opportunity to play a human during the awakening at all—the awakening meaning this period of time we're going through right now—is such an honor. It's like so unique and such a precious opportunity.<br>And are there humans on other planets?<br>I don't think so. I don't know. I would imagine not, but maybe other carbon-based DNA life forms. I don't know. I know there are other intelligent civilizations. I remember knowing that I had lived at least once in a different intelligent civilization in the physical with a very different vibrational experience. I don't know about humans or, you know, I don't know. That sounds strange to my logical brain.<br>And what about way back in history? I'm talking way, way back, like pre-Big Bang, and then post-Big Crunch. Are there other like—what I mean, let's even break it down. Let's start instead of before—okay, yeah, let's go through different ones first. Let's just start with this solar system. Okay, like, were there other material human or carbon-based complex consciousness in this dimension before this solar system developed?<br>Yeah, I don't know when in the 15 billion years of this universe I don't know when whatever given form of life appeared where. I have no access to that kind of information. I do know that life is developed throughout the universe at varying rates. So, that is because the whole universe is like a simulation occurring with spirit within consciousness, and consciousness is synonymous with the word life. Okay, so life is creating and utilizing this context. It's not like the context is first, and then life happens second. <br>Life happens first, and life utilizes the context and then shines through it in the form of various physical life forms or even forms that we might not consider conscious. Like, for instance, I was aware in my pre-birth experience—as long as we're going in this direction—that the sun itself had a living consciousness. It was like awareness. It's really hard to describe. So, I don't know when, but I, you know, in the context of the 15 billion years, but I can at least say that oh yes, we definitely precede the entire linear time sequence of the physical. It'd be like you asking after we played Minecraft for a few years, "Did we exist before Minecraft?" Uh, yes, yes, there's that's for sure. Just because you turn on a Minecraft server doesn't really affect the larger world that much. You know, it's kind of how it is here where our consciousness does precede the physical universe and its timeline.<br>Even before the Big Bang, and you think it will continue after the Big Crunch?<br><br> Where the conversation touches on the idea of a Big Crunch and the role of consciousness in the universe.<br>Yeah, if there's a Big Crunch, for sure. The whole year time sequence is a creation. It's an illusion. It's created within us. So, certainly, we precede the Big Bang. The Big Bang is just the beginning of the simulation. Someone hits the run button, and then it goes, and you know, now billions of years are unfolding, and that's fine. Do we precede that? Oh, yeah, yeah, we're not physical. We just lose ourselves in the physical experience at given points, and that's valuable. But the spirit certainly precedes the physical. In fact, there are these—it's hard to describe—these waves of creation where the like, like an out-breathing of universe and then an in-breathing, and then like waves within waves. <br>You could say, and then there's this expansion of being that accompanies each wave, and we utilize that. We participate in that, and we precede that whole process. I say we because I don't want to differentiate you and I, the little characters that we feel like we are, with the whole because as we are individuated as souls, but we are also one with the whole. Like, I said, so this is something that we and the whole are participating in together. It's very difficult to describe. And so, we are the creator. I'm just pointing out that we are creators. We are part of the creative process, not just lost within this loop or something.<br>So, how do animals play into all of this? Do we have the same—could we go be animals? Are animals doing the same thing along with us, and we're all kind of the same type of telepathically communicating souls on the other side? I mean, although I feel like I communicate really well with animals here.<br>Consciousness has animals, or consciousness has humans. Like, consciousness has human experiences, or consciousness has animal experiences. The differences might be significant in the local sense. You know, an animal has a very different cognitive potential than a human, for instance. But it doesn't matter. Consciousness precedes that limitation set and then uses it and shines through it. And in some ways, like take a dog for instance, you know, they might not be able to think the same way we do, but they're actually way more present in certain ways. <br>They're always present, just kind of shining with that light of being, and we love that. You know, we thrive on that. They actually serve us just by being with us because they don't have that burden of the cognitive hell that sometimes we wear in the form of all these thoughts that we get associated with that dogs don't have. But yeah, both are consciousness. I have one memory of being a non-human animal. I know that sounds really wild, but I remember being a migrating bird actually, and it was a very spiritual but very physically rigorous experience. <br>Very physically rigorous but very spiritual feeling. So, it was physically rigorous because life in the wild for animals is tough. Yeah, I don't really know why. I just remember it being really vigorous, and I remember just as an example—I know this is getting out there, but I'm just just for fun—I mean, this is what I remember. The it wasn't intellectual. Like, there was no ideas, you know, no like logical thoughts at all, but there was this knowing. This you could even say like a feeling that if I was separated from my flock, my pack, I would die. Like, it was terrifying to be without the flock. <br>That would be really, really bad, and then there was this compulsion to stay with that group. I know this sounds wild because from my human point of view, it's really alien reflecting back on that and feeling it is very alien feeling. It doesn't feel like me, the human conditioning that I'm used to that I'm wearing right now. It's very different, but still feels like me. You see, that's the thing. It's still me.<br>So, you said it's still you. Do you think we always stay ourselves when we're on the other side? Can we feel safe our loved ones are still themselves after they pass?<br>Yes, yeah, yeah. You're you. You're not the human. So, when the human—it's like the question is a little bit—and I mean this playfully—the question is a little bit like saying, "Are you still you when you take off your shirt?" Yeah, of course. In fact, you're less constrained. Stepping out of a body is like that. You're actually more like you. You actually feel more like yourself because now you're not all these limitations that you thought were you, like the age, you know, the health issues, the psychological conditioning that wasn't you. <br>You know, you kind of drop all that, and the real you isn't that thought set. It isn't that thought pattern. That was just something you wore, something you saw through. The real you is free and wonderful and alive. And yes, that individuated you is always preserved. It's precious. It's preserved, and that's true of all of our loved ones, even though they may have played other characters too. It's like if you have a high school play, you know, and you play these characters on a stage, and then later you go out for coffee, you don't have to be your character in the coffee shop anymore because you know that you're not that character. But you could really like reflect, reminisce, enjoy your relationship. In fact, you expanded your relationship through the play that you just acted on stage together.<br>You know, and you mentioned, you know, as the bird being terrified being separated from your flock because you would die, and we're all really scared of death. It's why are we scared of it if we've done it multiple times, and we are going somewhere where we're so much safer than here? Why do we have this like existential bleakness?<br>That's the main fear, yeah, because we've lost our identity, our ourselves, our sense of selves into an illusion. We've bought into the form. "I am the body. I am the story. I am the linear time. I am the job. I am the thing." And then guess what? Then the body dies. So, now what happens is when we learn that the body dies or we see a body die for someone that we love, what immediately happens so quick is we so quick we don't even catch it is we buy into a perception, "I can be destroyed." That's not true, but as soon as you buy into a perception that's not in alignment with the truth, fear arises mightily, and that great fear of death arises from the great misperception that I can be eradicated, I can be destroyed. <br>God can't be destroyed. It's the thing that is. It exists forever. It's the main thing that is. So, but when the main thing that is really buys into a perception that it can stop existing or that it can lose its freedom or that it can be powerless or that all the great negative perceptions we encounter on Earth—on Earth that provokes fear because it's not in alignment with the truth. See, but that's precisely the opportunity of Earth is we really get to come in and actually have the experience of perceiving like, "Wow, I'm going to die now. What do you do with that?" You know, and then when you step past it at the end, you look back, "Oh my gosh, there's never anything to fear," but you had the experience of being in that.<br>I'm reminded of a Seth quote. I don't remember it exactly. Seth was a guide channeled by Jane Roberts back in the '70s, and Seth said something like, "Every one of my physical lives, I thought I was going to die and be destroyed, and it would be oblivion. Every one of them." And he said something like, "If only one I could have known that truly I lived on, then even death could have been a great adventure." And I wish to share that message with people because I know it's not easy. I know this is super convincing, and we don't remember anything else, but really, there's nothing to fear. There is no death. Death is a big illusion.<br>And I know you made the comparison of a school play, but there's still certain characteristics that you play as a character in a play that don't carry over. So, they're characteristics of ourselves, our loved ones, that we just adore. Like, both my dad and my mentor, who sadly passed also, just had the best sense of humor and were so funny, and I love that about both of them. And I hope that is still aspects of them in the non-physical. Do some of our best qualities and personal traits carry over?<br>The soul has qualities. This is really difficult to speak to because the soul also transcends all form, but anyway, the soul has qualities, and we each have our own nature. You could say, and that nature is felt and known by each other. Like, in the non-physical, when someone shows up, you don't go, "Oh, hey, so-and-so name." No, you don't need to because you feel their vibration. You feel exactly who they are. Like, that's who they are is their being, their feeling, their vibration. <br>All the qualities that make them them, those qualities then shine through the human character and through the human limitation here. We do wear non-native limitations. Like, the biology might have limitations. Like, maybe you have a neurochemical issue because your body doesn't process a certain nutrient correctly or something. You know, now you are seeing the universe through a lens of a biology that doesn't work in a certain way. You know, so now you have to do what you can. You have to make choices from within that neurochemical context. <br>You're not actually the neurochemistry. When the body dies, and the neurochemistry is dropped, you actually feel more like yourself. But your native qualities can still shine through it. And what's really important also is of course our native qualities and who we are affect the body very much. They can help the body heal, or they can guide the body. The body is kind of like a living record, a living soundboard so that we can explore who we really are. And the true qualities of who we are, we absolutely do take with us.<br><br><br>I want to ask you a little bit about being Christian. What made you decide to be Christian—Christian the human, not Christian the religion.<br>Right, Christian the—oh yeah, Christian the human, Christian Sundberg. Yeah, I know that sounds crazy. I'm not actually Christian Sundberg. This is just a—there is no Christian Sundberg. I know you're seeing an image and hearing a voice. What I am is my awareness. I am the I. You are the you. You are the knower of your experience. But anyway, so why did I choose to engage this context? In my case, I wanted to process a very old fear that had bested me in a previous experience because I knew that there was a profound opportunity for expansion—the expansion of being and the evolution of consciousness, my consciousness, and all that is through this experience. <br>And so, the guides brought me this life as Christian as an opportunity that was a pretty good match for my intention. It actually wasn't as good of a match as a previous life that I had previously—not accidentally, but I had—I don't go too far down this path, but I had aborted this previous incarnation because I was so fearful in the womb. That previous life was actually a much better energetic match to my intention of facing this fear. This life was like pretty good, was good enough. So, that's like the main thing. And so, then when they brought it to me, I reviewed what it would be like to be Christian. You know, like millions and millions of possibilities before I was even incarnated. I reviewed like what it would be like to feel like to be me, to be here this long, you know, this like length of time that would feel so long, and to feel the body, and to feel what it would be like to actually be in certain circumstances that were more or less like depending on all the free will choice making that would unfold from me and from everybody else.<br>Now, the person you were supposed to be—was that with different parents?<br>I would say supposed to be same. That was no, that was just a previous opportunity that did not pan out. That was different parents. I don't know anything about that life. I just know it was more appropriate than this one would have been, but this is still good. It's good enough. Does the job. I'm glad I got to meet you, a cool person. I'm glad Christian Sundberg exists as you.<br>Okay, interesting. What do you know what number life, at least approximately?<br>I know that I've lived hundreds of times, but I don't have—I don't know about a number. I once meditated, and afterwards, I saw all these spheres that were my lives, and there were hundreds of them, and I was like, "Oh my gosh, I am all these people." Like, maybe that's a bad way to put it. I have experienced all these things. That's a better way to put it. So, I know that it's in the hundreds, but I have no idea.<br>Now, when we cross over, you said there's kind of different dimensions, just like here we could live in a village in Thailand, a big city in China, we could live in a small town in America. I mean, there's just so many completely different physical experiences we could have. Most likely, we can live on other Goldilocks planets. Are there all different communities and styles you could live on?<br>I can't speak in great depth about it because I'm still quite veiled, but there are for sure other communities that we can engage. I'm reminded of the book Autobiography of a Yogi that my wife and I are reading right now, and in this book, the author, Yogananda, his master comes back to him after death and shares his experience in what he calls the astral worlds and then the higher set of realities he calls the causal plane, and then he gives quite a bit of specific context to what those universes are like, those realms are like. <br>I won't attempt to be that specific, but I can at least say that yes, we tend to go—to put it very generally—we go where we resonate. We go where we vibrate. So, you could say the quality of your being and also your karma, which just means the cause and effect of all the choices you've made and whether you've been loving or fearful, tend to help guide you into future experiences that will be beneficial for you and for others in the long run.<br>And now, what about bad people? Because it sounds like—no offense, I don't think this about you as Christian Sundberg—I'm only repeating what you said. You were a person who was very, very unkind in previous lives. Once you said, "I had one previous life when I was so—"<br>The thing is that okay, we tend to think, "Oh, good people and bad people." There's duality talking again. So, the thing is though, the nature of spirit itself is love. Your true nature is love, no matter how many layers of crap have been piled on you in this life. Your true nature is love, and spirit knows that, and spirit sees that. Okay, but what there is though is a difference in levels of evolution. <br>You say we are each at a different stage in our evolution, and that makes it sound like duality, but for a second, let me just point out though that evolution doesn't necessarily mean it's not like a scale A to B. It'd be like saying, you know, I use this metaphor before, but I kind of like this metaphor. Like, if one person is like a grapevine, and the other person is like an oak tree, which one is more evolved? Which one's better? Well, you can't really compare them. One might be able to bear sweet fruit; the other one might be strong and have a thick trunk. They're just different. So, I'm just pointing that out because what we really have is difference in evolution.<br>And okay, so then though, what's the main thing that we're processing? And the simple word that I use is fear. Fear just means yet unevolved. It just means a part of us has rejected reality, and then when we do that, when we have fear, then this crazy fast thing happens here on Earth all over the place. We're living in a world that currently has—at least historically has been—and that is ego arises. <br>And ego is just the portion of the self that's really trying to do its best to fix the problem because now there's this big missing thing. "I don't feel connected to the whole anymore. I don't feel powerful. I don't feel loved." So, we just grab onto anything we can to try to get that power back or to try to get that love back or to try to prove to ourselves, "Look, I have value now because look, I got a 4.0 in college," or "I have value because I have money," or "I have power because look, I can harm the person next to me and be mean right now, and my ego makes me feel better for two seconds." <br>You know, our world—so I'm just saying we express through ego fear that we have. So, to your question, all I'm saying is this fear that I came to process in this life—in a previous life, it overtook me, and I became an egoic monster because I was so afraid. So, ego and bad—the bad person you could say—it just means they have fear, and that's okay. I'm not saying it's okay to cause damage. I just mean that it's okay to recognize, "No, no, no, it's okay if you have fear. <br>We can actually love and accept one another anyway." In fact, love is the answer to all that fear. And when we really process our fear, we grow in love, and then the ego doesn't have to be there anymore. It doesn't have to have an us versus them thinking anymore. It doesn't have to do that because the love, peace, joy, and freedom is our true nature. It just automatically rises up and shines as we process all the crap, as we process all the fear.<br><br><br>Now, this applies because some of the people you're talking about just sound like mean jerks, which is different than serial killers or dictators. Does it do the same thing?<br>I don't draw a big distinction, really. Okay, actually, because my fear is the same as Hitler's fear. The only difference is a difference in scope or actualized effect. Now, I'm not saying that the actualized effect isn't important. Oh, it's important. We should not hurt each other. We should do our best to be compassionate and love each other. And there are different degrees of fear, and there are different degrees of power that fear wields. But fear is always insane. <br>That's just the bottom line. It doesn't matter if it's a small fear or a large fear. Fear is always insane, and where ego is operating, it's insane. It's going to cause damage or hurt others in some degree. It's just that some of those individuals reach points of power, and then we have methodically wielded ego through many of our societal institutions actually because we've institutionalized us versus them thinking. We've institutionalized certain predatory economic patterns. You know, like, we really are deep in this ego game. That's just where we've come from. It's just because we have so much fear because the limitations are so extreme. So, we have to like worry about all that so much. It's just if we can go into ourselves and find and process our own fear, that actually helps the whole world to move forward and heal.<br>Now, this is getting maybe a little philosophical, but can't fear be good at times? Like, let's say there's a deadly pandemic, and you're scared, so you decide to stay home, and you save your life and vulnerable people's lives. I'm scared to drive 100 miles an hour on the highway, and that's probably a good thing because not only is that protecting myself, I'm protecting other people. Are there not fears that are good in those senses?<br>The way that I use fear is somewhat philosophical in the sense that I'm using it in the context of that which is the only apparent opposite of love. There's no actual opposite of love, but it's the only apparent real thing that we're dealing with here, and that is yet unevolvedness or rejection. The examples that you listed can all be undertaken without fear. You can be prudent and wise without fear. <br>You can recognize and decide not to drive 100 miles an hour, and you don't need fear to be the thing that tells you not to do that. No, you know, like one of the simple examples is in our society, we have a relatively crude justice system. It works, but it's not perfect, of course, and good people end up being hurt. So, the question is, do you need laws to prevent you from murdering someone? If you do, we should have some laws, and we are at the point as a species where many people do need laws. We do need the structures because we have the fear. But if there was no fear, if there was no ego, we wouldn't even need that. You see, because love is our true nature. I know that seems like a super far way away from where we are now, but I think it's important that we remind ourselves in that direction because that loving nature of spirit is the truth of what we are.<br>That reminds me of an interesting quote. I feel so bad I don't remember who said it because it was really great, but it was someone in response to a religious fundamentalist—and I'm not knocking religion, anyway, I'm knocking a very fundamentalist version—but a religious fundamentalist had written, "Without a belief in God, what stops you from raping and killing all you want?" And the person responded, "I am raping and killing all I want. I don't want to rape or kill anyone. <br>The amount I want to do that is zero, and the amount I've done that is zero." And I was like, "That makes so much sense because yeah, I don't, you know, as of now, I don't—I can't say I don't want to murder in the sense I don't want that on me, but if I had a chance to murder someone who was maybe like a serial killer and I could save a lot of lives, that would probably be the right thing to do. I don't know if I could do it presented with that. I don't know, but in that case, I would probably say if I knew this person was going to go murder like 20 children or just people, innocent people, it probably is the right thing to do, but it's absolutely—and I would probably be tortured with that being the one presented with that choice, but it probably would be the ethical thing."<br>This is a complex ethical point, of course, but I'll just at least make this one comment. I don't want to try to speak to that in breadth, but the person who might go cause harm to others is a part of you. They're your brother or sister. They're one with the ocean just as you are, and the people that they might go hurt are one with the ocean. And so, you can very lovingly acknowledge and with great compassion, "Oh, this person is acting unconsciously. I need to intervene," even if that intervention means physical violence. That might be required. <br>Now, here's the thing though, the ego will get a hold of that idea real quick because it wants excuses to play out its own us versus them thinking, its own seeking of power. I'm simply saying that we can act the way that is best for love even without that egoic fear. We can intervene against the person who might do something terrible even with love in our hearts, even though it makes us sad to do so, even if we know that they're our brother and sister. We can stand up and do the right thing, and we don't actually ever need to lose our peace. See, that's the thing. Anytime you feel like your peace is being lost, there's some association, some fear, some ego pattern that is being triggered.<br>Yeah, now we're going on an hour. Do you have time for a couple more questions?<br>Sure, wonderful. Yeah, I've just never had anyone on who's talked about the type of experiences you've had.<br>So, now, NDEers—near-death experiencers—will often say they experience their near-death experience as realer than real. When you—has it been realer than real for you?<br>Yes, wow, yes, 100%. So, both the out-of-body experiences I've had and the pre-birth experience were a thousand times more real, more lucid than this. I mean, I don't know, I can't put a number on it. A thousand is—I can't even put a number on it. It's just a different—it's like going to an IMAX movie theater and then going back and watching black and white television, and somebody says, "How do you know there's something outside of black and white television?" <br>Because guess what, I've seen it. It's so real there. Like I said, there is sensory experience on the other side that's so full and rich—sights and sounds and feelings and colors that don't even exist on Earth. And my pre-birth experience is so deep and so personal and so multifaceted. It's not like an earthly memory. It's very—oh, it's so holy and so close to me and so complete. I don't know how to describe it because it's not like one discrete thing. It's like connected to everything, and the realness of that is—it's far more real than even this.<br>And can I ask you what you mean by that? Like, do you have stronger physiological sensations? Do you feel more alive? I guess I've had very real dreams, very real, but they don't feel as real. I have yet to have any experience feel as real as here.<br>Yes, yes to both questions. So, we define reality on Earth. We tend to define reality as sensory experience and thoughts and feelings. I saw that you went to this place where there was this object which had this shape and this color and blah, blah, you know, on and on. So, we're very interested in that, and like I said, those do exist in higher systems and even in more rich and real ways. <br>As an example, one time I was out of body, and I was looking at the grass. Like, this reality—I don't know, I don't know how to describe it or label it, but I was in this place that had this beautiful sky and this beautiful grass, and this grass was so green and so lush and so alive. The color itself was living. The color was alive, and it was a part of me, and I was a part of it, but I also was me. I was also individuated. And I remember staring at this grass and being like, "Oh my gosh, the green of this grass is so beautiful and so green and so rich. I feel like I could stare at it all day and I would be completely filled with bliss just from staring at the green of this grass." <br>And so, I was, and then I started thinking, "What makes this so green?" As soon as I started kind of analyzing, in this case, I actually returned to the human awareness because I started using more—I started focusing into my human object set. But anyway, I'm just saying that that sensory experience was off the charts real. The aliveness is off the charts real. This experience is the more dead state. You know, it's funny because we talk about when people die, "Oh, you know, they're dead," and then when we portray in our movies the other side, we tend to portray these gray, drab environments as if life on Earth is the real thing, and that no, no, this is the more dead state right now. <br>This is the much more limiting state. This is the dream, but like in a fractal pattern, like all things arise here in this dream. We might fall asleep at night and have other dreams that are less real. That's like a fractal down a step down, whereas when we awake from this physical life, we are in a higher fractal pattern up, and it's more real, like waking up from a dream. It's like when you wake up from a dream in the morning, you don't have to say to yourself, "Oh, am I in my bed? Is this real?" You just know. You just know this is the real world, and the dream was just a dream. That's just normal. So normal, you get up and you go about and you have your breakfast. It's no big deal. It's like that after we die too. It's like, "Oh, that was just a dream," and that's the more normal, the more real, and it's just obvious.<br><br> Where the discussion explores the concept of the "other side" and its limitations, questioning the belief in a limited number of material lives.<br>And now, you described the other side, which after talking to you sounds so limited because it sounds like multiple other sides, just like calling you know whatever city you live in here the city or the town. Yeah, but is there a risk that it's so vast we can't find some of our loved ones who've also crossed?<br>No, okay, so the question arises out of the belief in distance and separation, whereas distance and separation aren't real. I know they appear very real. The one ocean of consciousness is one thing. It's always connected. It's always connected to every other part of the whole. So, you are connected to your loved ones right now, where not necessarily out in the virtual world of physical discrete world where things look like they're separate, but in the thing that's already one with everything else, and that is your aliveness itself, your consciousness itself, your beingness. Now, here on Earth, that beingness, that aliveness feels subtle. <br>When we first go start going towards it, it feels like the gross external world is super real. The internal world is very subtle. Okay, but if you go deep enough towards that aliveness itself—I don't want to stimulate the ego too much because this can be a stimulating idea—but there is a point when there's this incredible blissful inversion that can happen where it's like kind of being turned inside out, and the wholeness of your being can be known and felt as everywhere and connected to all things, and in that everywhereness is everyone else too. <br>So, the only thing that you ever need to do to connect with someone who's passed is an intention, a thought. If you have a pure intention—intention is the primary power that we wield as consciousness, not actually physical action, not actually thought. Those things are subsequent to intent. Intent is the real power. It's the movement of consciousness. When you intend to reach out and connect to someone you love, that's automatically a bridge with them. I heard it described by Silver Birch—he's another channeled source, the guide Silver Birch. <br>I heard him once communicate that from their perspective on the other side, this is just a metaphor, but if someone on Earth has a loving thought or a loving intention, they perceive it like a chime on the wind that they can then follow back to us, and that's beautiful. You know, so then I was just—I just comment though that practically speaking, there's this huge vibrational distance between the Earth realm and that side. What I mean is there's like a Grand Canyon of vibrational difference. <br>So, if we want to actually meet and interact with them, it's often impractical because we are deeply veiled, and we're so focused into these low vibration thoughts and patterns. If we let go of all that and kind of like let ourselves rise up in vibration, and they can sometimes come down, and we can kind of meet in the middle, maybe we have a dream together or a nudge of some kind. Anyway, just a comment about that.<br>Do we even live a limited amount of material lives? Do you ever hit a point where you're just like, "I am beyond a material dimension. I will never be a material level again"?<br>Yes, yeah. So, the material world is discrete and limited by nature. Like, there's only so many stars, there's only so many houses, there's only so much space, there's only so much time. That's just the very nature of our physical universe. So, to that effect, similarly, then yes, metaphorically, you could say like the soul—like, you're only going to go to college so many days. You don't go to class forever. <br>You might go a few thousand times, you know, but eventually, it's just not going to be useful or beneficial or meaningful to pursue that anymore. So, it's similar with a physical incarnation cycle. You know, you may have many experiences, but eventually, there's not value in the continuation of it, so you're not going to continue. In fact, the physical is such an alien state. It's like, you know, it's quite a cost to come here because now we have to actually really experience these difficult themes that can be very rigorous and potentially challenging. So, you know, would we want to do that forever? No, no, not really.<br>Yeah, and when someone has gotten to this really high state, is there a limitless level of high state, or do you then just go and try to start accomplishing other things and continuing to grow to higher levels?<br>The simplest answer I feel is that evolution never stops. We ever refine towards greater and greater levels of being. So, there isn't an end. The linearity of it is a creation itself. There's no linear end. You could say that love and joy have no limit. So, because they have no limit, evolution—we will participate in evolution without end, without limit, and that's a beautiful thing, not a curse. You know, some people think, "Oh, I don't want to do this forever." <br>No, that's because anytime we think that, it's because we are incorrectly believing that existence sucks. Like, we're believing that association with form is negative, so life must be negative, and I don't want to do that forever. In fact, just a quick comment, when we notice that we're doing that, it means there's something in ourselves that we haven't yet integrated yet. There's some opportunity for expansion that we haven't quite allowed yet. <br>And yes, I know that when we look at this rich world with all of its difficulties, it's easy for the mighty ego to rise up in righteousness and say, "No way, I reject this. There's no way I'm going to be okay with this." But the thing is, love is not about rejection. It's about acceptance and embracing and compassion and full feeling and full being. When we can really do that here, then that is like—you could, I'm using this word very loosely, but that is like graduation. When we fully come to accept all of the physical, all the feelings, all the limitations, all the responsibility, all the love, that's like—then it's ironic because then it's okay if you come back, but now you don't need to anymore.<br>So, people like that have come back here. Who would they be on our planet?<br>Yeah, I mean, I'm only surmising, but I feel like Jesus would be a great example, perhaps the Buddha. There are many saints throughout time. You know, like I said, I'm reading Autobiography of a Yogi right now with my wife, and there are a number of amazing individuals who are very spiritually aware listed in that book. It's not particular to a specific religion or country or time period. It's that—see, this is the thing. This is really important. Really evolved, loving beings recognize the value and power of service. Love wants to serve. It wants to give. <br>So, beings who are very loving and evolved—loving and evolvedness are synonymous. You see, so very evolved beings want to come back and serve. I'm reminded of this one book—I forget what it was—I think it was a Bob Monroe book where he was interacting with a guide who is very evolved, and he asked her to show him like where she resided, where she was, and he saw this really downtrodden slum, and it was this very difficult, you know, poor place with lots of difficulty, and he said, "Why? What? You're so loving and wise. Why would you be there?" <br>And she said, "This is where I am needed." You see, that's the nature of love is to come back for those who yet have fear to help others grow in love and to heal and to return to the formlessness that we are, to basically work through and integrate all this so that we can step past it and realize the form never had what we're seeking. The love and the joy of being—it already preceded all the form. It already transcended the form. <br>So, we could say we come back for those who might be lost in the illusion of form still to help until we return to that love and that freedom of our being rather than to being, quote-unquote, lost, trapped, or enslaved within association to form. We're not actually ever lost or trapped or enslaved. Never. I'm just saying we experientially become trapped because of our association with thought and with the form and with the stimulating of all the sense data of the Earth and all the rest.<br>And so, just after we've done all the physical, either we come—there's still always more to do. So, sometimes we'll come back here and be the higher level. Sometimes we'll be doing stuff in dimensions you or I—or at least I can't understand. You do understand deep down though. I'm not special. It's we all know, even though this might not intellectually make a lot of sense. And I encourage the big question mark underneath. Your being knows and intuits the freedom that I'm referring to.<br>Where can our listeners find you, follow you, stay up to date?<br>Yeah, so right now, I just have a website, A Walk in the Physical. I do post talks there, and my email address is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a> I can't respond to everybody. Sometimes I get just too many emails to respond to. Eventually, I may have a YouTube channel or maybe some other form of social media. I haven't decided yet. I feel like eventually that's naturally going to unfold, but for now, yeah, please visit my website. The book is available to be read online for free there at the third link down, or it's available on Amazon or Audible as an audiobook.<br>Great. Thank you so much.<br>Thank you so much for having me on. It is wonderful to see you here in the physical, even though I have no idea how I know you. It's wonderful to meet here in this way, and thank you for the service you're providing. I love this context because, like, I'm a left-brain person too. This stuff really is real, and it's excellent to approach this in a way that is open to skepticism. I know this stuff sounds out there. Go investigate. You know, just be a scientist. Go investigate your own consciousness. Find out what you really are underneath thinking, and it's amazing what's there.<br><br>You ever wonder what mediums do with their free time? How about a 30-something-year-old gay medium living in New York City? Well, in this podcast, you're about to find out. Welcome to Ghost Daddy, a place where LGBTQ+ spiritual people and our cis hetero allies, of course, have a place to just be themselves and spread their wisdom. This is the new face of spirituality—none of that love and light, toxic positivity crap. So, pour yourself a vodka soda, open up your mind, and start listening.

You are going to want to hear Christian Sundberg, who has presented at over 100 events as he does his part to remind others who we are beneath this human play of ours. He had this most incredible experience as a young child, remembering his existence before he came to Earth. He talks about his out-of-body experiences, his life review, and even talks about narcissism and what that's about as far as an undeveloped spirit is concerned, and why the message of love is so important for all of us here on Earth.  <br>Come join us, enjoy from my heart, many blessings. Hi there, and welcome to the Grief and Rebirth Podcast. I'm your host, author, and trauma survivor, Irene Weinberg, here to encourage you wherever you are in your healing journey. In each episode, I chat with incredible grief and trauma specialists, healers, mediums, and celebs, as well as remarkable people who have inspiring healing stories to share. If you're looking for a podcast that's both uplifting and inspiring, you found it. Let us help you find your joy in life.  <br>Hi everyone, I'm speaking to you today from my studio in West Orange, New Jersey, and I could not be more delighted to have the pleasure of interviewing Christian Sundberg, who has worked for 16 years as a project manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing projects. In addition to his work in the nuclear industry, Christian also serves as a project manager for an insurance company.  <br><br><br>When Christian was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While that memory left him completely for his early adult life, it spontaneously returned 14 years ago as Christian took up a meditation practice, went through a personal awakening journey, and began to have out-of-body experiences. Christian has presented at over 100 public speaking events as he does his part to remind others who we really are beneath the human play. His book, titled A Walk in the Physical, attempts to succinctly describe the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey.  <br>I'm looking forward to asking Christian about his experience as a young child, remembering his existence before coming to Earth, his awakening journey, his out-of-body experiences, his insights about what the human experience is and what our true nature is, what it means to be veiled, why the message of love is so important to our journey here on Earth, and so much more for what is surely going to be an incredibly fascinating and very enlightening interview for all of us.  <br>Full disclosure, I met Christian at the International Association of Near-Death Experiences Conference in 2023. I signed up to be part of a group that enjoyed lunch with Christian. I listened to his enlightening presentation, and we took a photo together. It was then that I decided that I wanted to share Christian's fascinating, enlightening messages and healing insights on the Grief and Rebirth Podcast.  <br>Hi Christian, a truly warm, heartfelt welcome to the Grief and Rebirth Podcast. It's so great to be with you again.  <br>Thank you so much, Irene. I'm so excited. It's great to see you. Yeah, we're going to have such a great conversation. I can't wait to share you with everybody. You have such an amazing, insightful story to share with everyone.  <br>So let's start from the beginning. How old were you when you had your pre-birth memory? Please describe it for us and describe the moment when it first returned to you after you took up meditation. Then I think it's kind of linked to this other question I had about how you've had many different lifetimes with different roles, right?  <br>Yes, and so just start, and we'll move on. We'll go.  <br>Thank you, thank you so much, Irene. So before I dive into this, I just always have to disclaim first that language cannot do this justice. We're going to use language because that's what we have, but words are so limiting. As soon as we put words on it, it's just like wrong. So I'm going to do my best, but I just have to lift that up because, you know, words are forms, symbols, and our true nature transcends the entire system of form that we exist in right now as humans.  <br>So it's really hard to put language on this. Okay, so I'll try to give it a shot. So our true nature is kind of stuffed into these bodies. Yes, we are stuffed down into the form, into an extreme amount of limitation. Yes, we are, and yeah, it's a very alien set of limitations, actually. And so yeah, even just using language, using words, even just talking, it's a very strange way to communicate, actually. It's pretty inefficient, but anyway, so yeah, I was 44 years old. I'm 44 years old now. I was 30 years old, my body was 30 years old, when I had the pre-birth memory return.  <br>So after I had meditated for several months, I certainly wasn't expecting anything, but I began to have very eye-opening, non-physical experiences, out-of-body experiences, and at about the same time, the pre-birth memory was just there. It was just so normal. And I know it sounds extraordinary to share the story, but it didn't seem extraordinary because when I had really let go fully of the form association, the thoughts, and the stories that I thought made me me, and I really investigated my consciousness itself, it was just so natural that I existed beyond the human story, and my pre-birth planning was just part of this story.  <br>And it was there. So I'll try to be succinct. There's a lot to it, but I remember long ago, and I know this sounds wild by the way, but that's why you're here. I'm a normal person. I'm a working professional. I know how this sounds, but you know what? Everyone listening to this also knows that I didn't believe in any of this, and I had this amazing spiritual awakening also. So ride with us, everyone. This is an incredible story.  <br><br><br>So I remember long before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had incarnated physically, but I had not yet. And I felt from him the quality of his nature. So this is so hard to describe because in those systems, the higher realms are all thought-responsive, and we feel and know our connectedness with one another. There's a telepathic exchange which is very natural, and I could feel from him this incredible power, love, joy, and depth of freedom that was just shining within him and from him.  <br>And I asked him, "Oh my gosh, do you feel as much freedom and joy as I feel that you feel?" And he shared, "Yes." And I was able to see, like he shared into himself, and he shared with me many things, but chief among them, because I asked, "How did you do this?" And he shared with me that he had lived physical lives, and there was one in particular where he had suffered a long-term health condition. He had a pain that lasted in his body for years, and the way that he chose to meet that experience allowed a refinement of his being.  <br><br><br>And I was so inspired. I was like, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I'm going to do that." Like I was like, "Sign me up," you know, because it was just so amazing, so inspiring. And he said at first, he said something like, "And this is not negative," but he communicated something like, "That's what they all say. You don't really know what you're asking." Like I was just ignorant of how hard it can be in the physical, you know, which everybody listening to this podcast knows how hard this can be.  <br>From that perspective, at that time, I was not aware, but I persisted. I said, "No, I immediately he said, 'Go talk to your guides.'" So I did, and I know that I lived many times after that, but the majority of my pre-birth memories are of a time somewhat immediately preceding this life, and not just this life, but the life just before this life. I had taken a long break in between lives, and I remember this guide coming to me repeatedly, like every once in a while, coming and asking, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And kind of putting him off, being like, "No, I'm not ready yet. No, I'm not ready yet."  <br>And finally being like, "Okay, I'm ready." And not pestering, but like reminding me of my own intention, you know, and then reviewing with this guide what I can only describe as my state, like who I am, who I had been, what I understood, what I knew, and it was very obvious the thing that I needed to quote "work on." And I don't like the words "need" or "work on" because it's not a need. You don't have to do this, and it's not a task, okay? But I could see that there was this very low vibration fear that had bested me in a previous experience, and because of that fear, I had become a very egoic and damaging person in that previous experience.  <br><br><br>So I could see, "Oh man, like it was almost like a joke, like how easy it was to identify the thing that would be best for me to work on." But I knew that that fear, like so okay, so processing this fear was the important aspect of this challenge, but I knew that the fear was so low vibration. I was like, "Can this even be done? Like has any other being in creation ever processed a fear energy that's this low in this specific way?" Like it was, it just I could see even from there, like wow, that is a breathtaking fear.  <br>And I was told, "Yes, and you have all of time available to you to do so. There's no hurry." And I just knew, "Well, if it can be done, I will do it now."  <br>Is the purpose when you come across something like this, Christian, to choose to overcome this so that your soul continues to evolve?  <br>Yes, it is about the evolution of joy and love. It's about the deepening of the self, and so fear is just something that we've got stuck on and that we've rejected. It's something we haven't integrated yet, some experience or some perspective that we haven't integrated yet. And so this fear was of the nature, it was of a perspective. The deep perspective was, "I am powerless to escape agony," mixed with, "I'm too proud to suffer like this." Kind of a very specific, like no, and I'm, I, I, I don't know how to describe this certain perception. It really had gotten stuck there, so to speak.  <br><br><br>And so I was very excited to have the opportunity to reface this. You know, it's not masochism, okay? It's that we see the absolutely profound, off-the-charts opportunity that is available to us in the physical, and I was super, super excited. So they brought me a life that was really appropriate for that intention, and it wasn't this life. It was an immediately preceding life, and I remember reviewing that life in incredible detail, and I remember accepting that life, and then I remember accepting the veil.  <br>Okay, so the veil is just the word that we use for the set of limitations and constraints that we take on in consciousness in order to have the physical experience and be the human because if we remembered what we came from, we wouldn't learn the lessons we came here to learn. Correct?  <br>Yes, yeah, you couldn't have the human. You couldn't be the perspective of the human if your perspective was knowing that you are the all and there's absolutely nothing to fear. We don't come for fear. We come for the definition, the limitation set, the context, the rich context. That's what we come for. And so that context in our reality means a veiling, a forgetting. It's like the name of the game here is a forgetting into a state of separation, apparent separation. We're actually not separate. This is really important spiritually.  <br>We are not separate from each other. We're not separate from the whole. We're not separate from Source, God, whatever word we want to use. That's not possible, actually. But this reality is like the most extreme version of separation, so if you really want to experience being separate, then the veiling is what's necessary in order to obscure the knowing, and it seems to erase the memory, you know.  <br>So in my case, as I accepted the veil for this life, it was like a plummet in the vibration of my being. So imagine the body of your awareness connected to everything, and you have access to all knowledge, and it's total bliss, and then suddenly being squeezed down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, like a diving low, low, low. I like to describe it like a pitch that's being produced by a sound producer, like an amplifier or something, and it's like a high pitch, and then you turn down the knob, and then when you get to the bottom, you turn it down more, and then you turn it down more, and then more, more, more, and then more, more.  <br>That's how it felt. It was just this absolutely incredibly intense drop in vibration all the way down, down, down into being bodily. And so I arrived to the body. I was in the fetus, the body of a fetus inside my mother, and I was like, "I am not doing this. There is no freaking way. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I've forgotten all that I am. I'm not putting up with a lifetime of this."  <br>And fear rose up, and I summoned that fear, that fear that you were looking to get rid of. Yes, and it is very much related to that. It was an expression of that root fear, absolutely, because here I was limited, stuck, unable to escape, you know, and I'm like, "No, mm." So I summoned my might, my spiritual might, and I because I knew I could, and I smoked the veil. I fought my way back out.  <br>Wow, Trisha, just hold on to your thought. Yeah, so everyone listening to this, they've all had this experience of going down, down, down, down, down and entering. Yes, so I mean, of course, I can't speak for a given person, but yes, we all do accept it. It has to be a choice, okay? We have to accept the limitations of the physical, which include the veiling, in order to have this experience.  <br>The reason it has to be chosen is because, at the deepest level, at the level of the soul, you are a piece of God. Like, there's no greater authority. You are completely, utterly sovereign and powerful. So what can lock God away except for God? Nothing. So that means we make a choice. We voluntarily surrender our power into limitation, into the veil.  <br>Wow, so that's really important because, without surrendering at ourselves, no one else can take it. That's not how it works. So I can at least say that yes, we've all accepted the veil in order to be here.  <br>So in this experience, I said, "No way," and I smoked the veil, and I fought my way back out, and I was successful at doing that because I was once again on the other side, and I saw that I had killed the fetus that was to be my body. I caused a miscarriage for the mother, and I saw how my choice impacted the mother and how she experienced deep grief because of the miscarriage that I had caused, right? And how her grief affected hundreds of other people. I could see, like ripples in a pond, like I didn't just affect her. I affected hundreds of people because her grief meant that she would take more weight, more sorrow into her life, into her interactions, and that was basically the result of my choice.  <br>I don't want to say my fault because that's not the way the spirit looks at it, but it was the result of my choice, you know, like I caused that change. So I could see that in my life review, and I thought, "Oh man, I mean, you know, it's okay, like from that point of view, it's okay, but I also could see very objectively, like oh man, I got a lot of fear. I got to do something about this."  <br>But there's something else that's coming to me. You had just entered a fetus, you decided to leave, and you got a life review when you returned just from that little stint. I'm not even totally manifesting. Well, I had manifested. I was in the planet. I just hadn't been born, right? You know, whether or not the baby has emerged from the mother's body is not actually the defining line. You know, like I was in the body of the womb. I don't know when, but I felt like for this life, it felt like I came in very early in the pregnancy, and it felt like a long time that I was in my mother's womb.  <br>And I understand that the soul enters the body at different times also. Yes, that's my understanding as well. For me, it was early, but I know of others who might enter later during the pregnancy or even during birth or even slightly after birth. Yeah, yeah.  <br>So I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I thought that was a, everybody, you realize, okay, so keep going. Okay, so basically, I wanted to, I still had this intention, so they brought me this life, and I reviewed this life in incredible detail. And what I mean is, it was like a flowchart of millions and millions and millions of possibilities of what this life might be like. It was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side and started at the thick part of the tree and worked your way out to the branches.  <br>I could see all the possible paths that were predicted as potentials, and I could feel what it would be like to be me. I mean, there were events in it, but it wasn't primarily about events. You know, humans are like, we want to know about events, but the way I reviewed it was more like, what would it be like to be me, to be Christian, and human? And I could see that it was very likely that in my early 20s, I would be crushed by a health condition.  <br>Wow, and that would cause that would give me the opportunity to re-experience this fear, and I was super excited again. This is not masochism, but I could just see the opportunity, and it was amazing. And I asked questions about the life. I made certain requests, like I asked, "Can I be intelligent again in this life?" Because I knew that in recent lives, I had been intelligent, and that was an aspect of experience that I didn't really want to give up. I enjoyed that, and they said, "Yes, you can do that."  <br>And I knew it was important that I be a man, be male, not that you know, men and women, not that either sex is better or worse or something. They're just different energies, you know, and the certain kind of energy of being male would give me kind of like almost like an obtuse edge or something to face this fear. And I knew that the way my father would treat me would be important. He would raise me with confidence, you know, like I wouldn't have a self-esteem issue because of my father, and that would allow me to have a rock to stand on when the fear arose.  <br>So then I remember there having to be a moment to say yes, and I don't remember that moment, but I do remember being in this waiting area. It's the only way I can describe it, and then this guide coming to me and being like, "Go now," like really, really abruptly, like almost like a slap across the face, not negative, very like, "Go now, you're on Earth time, buddy, go." And I'm like, "Okay," and then being in this, how do I describe this? It's like it was like a mechanic shop or a space station or something above the Earth, and below me was the Earth.  <br>I could see the Earth. There was like a shaft, like a clear window. You could say in front of me were these beings that I can only describe as veil technicians. I know this sounds wild, but they were very technical in nature, and their being is extremely skilled at veil application because the soul is so unique in its nature and in its qualities, and each given life is so unique, each given body, each given world, you know, each species, each family, even. There's so many energetic things going on, and so they do this thing that, like, I don't know, makes it organically fit so that the veil works well. It's effective, and it's like custom-tailored, so to speak.  <br>And so I remember them asking me one last time, "Are you ready? Are you sure?" And I knew that if I said yes here, I was in for the ride, and I said yes. And then once again, I felt the vibration plummet down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, all the way down, like so low, and feeling like I was being shoved inside of a tuna can, but also feeling like I had arrived to a place that was empty and cold, like the vacuum of space, even though I was in the body. It just felt vibrationally so dark, cold compared to where I had been.  <br><br><br>And this time, I just tried not to fight it, you know, because I knew, just don't fight the veil. Let it do what it will do. Surrender to it. And then I was there for a while, and then eventually, I sent one message back to the technicians, "Did it take?" And they sent one message back, "Yes." And then I felt accomplished, actually, because I knew even making it to the physical was a huge step. It was an accomplishment.  <br>That was your first step in overcoming fear in this lifetime. It was actually a first step in coming forth, and no one's ever brought that up, but that actually is the beginning of that, the beginning of this life. That yes, yes, that's very powerful.  <br>Well, okay, so but at this point in the story, I hadn't quite said yes yet because I hate to even call it a story because this is an experience that is alive even right now, like this experience that I share. It has a sequence, but it's also not linear like human experience. Anyway, so that's really a hard quality to describe.  <br>Okay, so after I was there for a while, I was like, "I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this. This is not happening. This is so dark. This is so cold. I am not going to put up with a lifetime of this. No way."  <br>So you're in another womb, and you're doing the same. Now I'm in my mother's womb in this life, and you're doing the same. You're going through the same trip. And so once again, I began to summon my might to fight my way out. When I did that, the most holy moment of my entire life happened. The spirit of what we call God, the Great I Am, the presence of all things, came down to me and unfolded me back out, and I felt everything within me.  <br>I felt our universe within me, and I felt the sun of Earth within me, and it was churning with bliss, and God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And it was, I was like, "Oh," because the reason I was fighting was because I thought I lost everything that I was. I thought I lost my true nature, but I hadn't. It was just a veiling. It was just a big illusion, you know.  <br><br><br>So I stopped fighting, and I let go into the simple existence of being in the womb. I'm sorry, I really try to, you know, not get moved to tears every time I tell the story, but honestly, it's like pulling down my pants every time I tell this because, Christian, I love that freaking holy. It is so freaking holy to me.  <br>And so that was one of the main reasons I didn't share this for a long time because it's like, you don't talk about stuff that's just that holy, but then I thought, "Wait a minute, like this could help," because that's what motivates me, okay? It's because this is not specific to me. This is not about me. This is about us, man. This is about what we are all doing here. We are all spirit that is much, much larger than the human experience. We really are. That is the truth.  <br>Now, we may be very, very, very deeply veiled into form. I'm not making light of that, okay? But the truth of our being, which is total love, peace, freedom, and joy, is such good news that I just want to share it. Like, what could be more important to say? So that's it. It feels like this could be your sole purpose in this lifetime also, to share this, to bring all.  <br>I know I'm excited to share love if that's possible because if we can do it here, that's freaking awesome. Mhm, that's amazing. So you know, you had some really eye-opening experiences. I mean, I'm fascinated by your out-of-body experiences, and I had an out-of-body experience during a car accident, but I just went into the void. I really did, and very quickly afterwards, I re-entered my body as the car was spinning around.  <br>But could you tell us about some of your experiences, Christian, and the insights they provided you also as you've gone through all this? Your story is so amazing.  <br>Sure, so okay, so first of all, out-of-body experiences are very normal when we are not so deeply associated into form anymore. We all experience higher aspects of ourselves that are engaging other reality systems all the time. And I've had different kinds or types of out-of-body experiences, and I'm not quick to label them because they're so hard to label.  <br>I will say that I have experienced reality systems that are so freaking lucid and beautiful and full of color and light that they put Earth to shame. And people say, "Well, how do you know that was real?" No, this is so self-evidently real when you're in that state of being. It's so clear and lucid and connected and pure and full. It'd be like watching an IMAX movie and then coming back to a tiny 8-inch black-and-white television, and someone says, "Well, how do you know the IMAX was real?" It's like, "Well, this is like nothing. This black-and-white television is dull and tiny by comparison."  <br><br><br>It's like that. So I feel like that was the main takeaway, like I remember when I first started having these experiences, I was so excited. I just wanted to tell people. I was like, "We really are multi-dimensional beings of love, and we have nothing to fear. This is incredible. People need to know this." And there was this funny moment. I've shared this before, but it just reminds me of how kind of silly excited I was, and I only entertained this idea for about five minutes.  <br>But I told my wife, "I'm going to make flyers, and I'm going to put them in people's mailboxes, and they're going to say, 'You're a multi-dimensional being of love, and you have nothing to fear.'" And then she's like, "If you do that, you're going to be that guy." I was like, "Oh yeah, I will be that guy if I do that." So of course, that's not the way to reach people. I'm just sharing that I was extremely excited because it feels a little bit like winning the lottery, you know, when you discover, "Oh my gosh, I am not just the limitations of the body."  <br>Now, there's only been one time in my whole life I've been able to voluntarily lay down and go out of body. I typically don't have conscious, you know, I don't just lay down and do it, but it happens here and there, you know. One time, I was walking around my house, and I thought I was awake, and I thought it was a Saturday morning, and then I started wondering, "Am I out of body?"  <br>I was walking around. I could feel the carpet under my toes. I could feel the cracks in the wall. I got to the bottom of my steps, wondering if I was out of body, and I actually concluded I was not. That's how normal it was. That's how lucid and clear and perfectly normal it was. And then I felt stupid for even wondering because, and then I thought, "I'm the only guy in my city wandering around his house wondering if he's out of body. Now I feel like an idiot."  <br>But the light was still just slightly different, and I thought, "You know, man, maybe this really is out of body." I'm like, "Okay, so if I'm out of body, I'll be able to walk through this wall and go out into my front yard." And so I did. I walked right through the front wall. I was actually, and then I kind of teleported right into the middle of my yard because that's how it works when you're out of body. If you want to be somewhere, you just are there.  <br>And I could see the sun rising, and I was like, "Holy crap," and then as soon as I started thinking about it, I was back in my body. But it wasn't like when I woke up in my bed. That was more real. No, it was equally real. Like I was in my front yard, then I was in my bed. Do you know what I mean? Amazing. Like it's not like it's so normal. It's like when it happens, you're like, "Oh my gosh, what the heck was that?"  <br>Is it just that your soul at the moment, like just kind of loosens its grip and just leaves for a little while? Is that so?  <br>I like to reverse the order here and instead of thinking of it like there's a physical universe and there's a body, and you're inside of it, and it's real. It's actually the other way around. Your soul is the thing that's real. Your consciousness is the thing that's real, and the physical is just something arriving on and in it. It's like when you watch a movie at the movie theater. If someone said to you, "How do you leave the movie?" Well, you were never in the movie. You were just staring at it.  <br>So what is the thing that we're staring at? Real hard sense data and thoughts. Like I know that sounds like, "Well, what is reality beneath those?" Because as soon as we start looking beneath sense data and thoughts, at first, it seems like there's nothing there. It's just silence. The living fabric of your consciousness is very deep. It has a lot going on, and when you can really let go of focusing on all the very demanding sense data and all the very important thoughts, and your thoughts will be very important because they always are. That's why they're arriving. They have something important. They're demanding your attention for.  <br>When you let go of all that deeply, you find, "Oh, that stuff is just arising in me. I see. I'm actually not the thoughts. I'm not the sense data." So the reason I'm responding in that way is because the physical universe is kind of like that. There's a Seth quote, something like, "Physical reality is like a bright point of light that you just never look away from, but you can."  <br>And so I like that description. So when your body is asleep, you know, that's a natural time because you're not focused on the sense data. Your brain's off. Your body's asleep, you know, but if your consciousness awakens, then you have it's easier to go out of body because you're no longer being captured by that dense sense data.  <br>So yeah, that's fascinating. That's fascinating. I mean, it's bringing me to, I can remember two out-of-body experiences I've had. I had the one in the car accident, and I had one when I was a kid, and you just described what happened when I was a kid. I was sleeping, and all of a sudden, I felt myself kind of flying over my house and exploring, and I suddenly said, "What is this?" And then I brought my soul back into my body before I, and I didn't realize at the time what was happening.  <br>So thank you for, thank you for that education that you just gave me. You just gave me another little piece to understand my own experience. So can you, one small comment there, just for that might be helpful for somebody. So, just a tiny little comment. So assuming that the physical is the fundamentally real thing and that you are stuck here, that belief is part of the thing that keeps it locked in.  <br>I'm just lifting that up because, as soon as you kind of loosen even that belief and start really alertly looking at your reality, just even your waking reality, it tends to open the door for other experiences because your consciousness is already starting to be like, "Wait a minute, is this really as firm as I thought?" I'm just lifting that up.  <br>Yeah, no, I know, and I'm going to make the contribution because I want my next question, and I have a comment about it. This is so fascinating and so wonderful to talk with you. <br><br><br>My next question is, why does a soul actually come to Earth, which we're kind of establishing is to evolve and to get rid of issues that we've come upon in other lifetimes and all, and how does the soul expand through choice-making, and why do many souls choose these significant challenges on Earth?  <br>So do we choose these unbelievable things that some of us are going through? Do we choose them because we want, like you, you were overcoming fear? We all are trying to learn something and elevate our soul consciousness from our choices, but people don't make very good choices, and they don't go anywhere. So could you explain that concept to us?  <br>Yes, first of all, it's not possible to not go anywhere, but so we do come to evolve and to learn, but the learning is not an intellectual learning. Intellectual learning happens. That's a part of it, but it's not about intellectual learning. It's about a growth of the being by being something, okay?  <br>So what are the two main ways that we really are growing? And these are both very big. The first is experience integration. So that is, we come to terms with what we're experiencing, and we integrate it into what we are. We really figure it out. We really learn it. We really experience it. We experience something to the point where we say, "Oh, I've been there, done that," you know, like we get real experience.  <br>And so that includes processing our experience psychologically, processing our experience, okay? So this, and the second main one is, and this is like the most important thing, we come to wield a high quality of intention because what I mean by that is, we come to wield an intention that is loving and all the things that love meansвЂ”love, joy, peace, freedom, our true natureвЂ”rather than intention that is aligned with fear, which means ego because the ego arises from fear.  <br>So all the anger, the selfishness, the pettiness, you know, all that stuff that we do that arises out of fear, that's fear-based intentionality. Why am I saying intention and not choice-making? Because intention actually precedes the choice context. It then shines through the choice context and makes choices in it, and the quality of intention that we refine here, we get to keep that.  <br>See, the context will fall away. Consciousness will not fall away. You will still, the lessons we learned and the things that we went through, they will stay with us as we move forward and come into another lifetime or whatever. Absolutely. It's still you. It's like if you do something Monday night and then you do something Tuesday night and then you do something Wednesday night, even if you did a different activity those three nights, it's still you, and you still take with you what you learned on Monday to Tuesday and Tuesday to Wednesday.  <br>Now, in the case of reincarnation, even though what we're talking about is an intellectual context wipe, that is not the critical part, actually. The critical part is, as a being, who are you? What are you? What do you want? Understand at the being level. What do you really, what have you processed? You could even say, what virtues? I don't want to make this sound too prescriptive, but basically, what virtues have you truly learned, truly developed, that you truly embody?  <br>You see, it's about quality of intention, not just the context, not just the understanding, you know. But what about people who come with the intention and they kind of fail because they fall into fear and negativity and judgment and all of those things in a lifetime? They don't seem to grow. They seem to burrow more into the negative aspects of being.  <br><br><br>Fear is always insane, whether it's small fear or large fear. So let's just say that first. Fear is not the optimal choice, and fear just means yet unevolved, okay? So it just means there's some part of our experience, some context, some situation, some perspective that we have not fully come to terms with or healed. And I like the word "healed." That we have not fully healed or integrated yet.  <br>But to your question, what about people who fail? Okay, so now if I said to you, "This person is going to go to the gym, and they're going to bench press 80 pounds, and this person over here is going to go bench press 200 pounds," maybe the 80-pound person has no problem, and they are able to lift the weight, and the 200-pound person has a real challenge. They really have a hard time. They're lucky if they get it up one rep. Did they fail? No, they lifted 200 pounds. It was heavy.  <br>You see, the reason I'm lifting it up that way is the context of Earth. Failure is not really the right way to look at it. It's just that we sign up for different levels of constraint, different challenge levels. So for instance, if you sign up for a lifetime where you have a physical illness, that's a lot harder in certain ways than signing up for a life where the body is fully healthy.  <br>Or maybe you sign up for a context where your family life is very difficult. Then you are basically robbed of certain psychological strengths or supports that would have been useful. Or maybe you're born, maybe you choose to be born into a country where war is likely, and now you have to deal with this terrible societal context where people are being killed.  <br>Now, so it's about what we do with that context. It's not that we enter into it and, "Oh, now we failed." No, see, the love of spirit is so understanding. It is so, so, so understanding. That's why when we say that God's love is unconditional, it is absolutely unconditional, and it's not a stupid unconditional. It's like a ridiculously wise unconditional because it sees exactly those limitations. It knows us better than we know ourselves. It can see every angle, and it is us.  <br>And so it knows exactly why we were pushed to make a choice that might have been less loving. Now, does that mean that we should make fearful choices? No, we're here to choose love. We're here to overcome that fear. We're here to process it out, but it also means that it's not about judgment and failure. No, we, it'd be like if someone went to Mount Everest and climbed the mountain, and they only got halfway up. When they come back down, you don't say, "Oh, you failed. You failed." No, man, we respect them for that because they went to a very challenging place in the cold where there was no air.  <br>That's how it is being human. We've come to this place where spiritually there's like no air. It's so cold here. There's so much fear in this world, and even while we're here, we're trying to make the very brave choice of being loving. You see, it's like doing it in the midst of the muck. That's the great challenge, and we are respected for that, not judged.  <br>Wow, and that's a big thing that I have learned as I evolve. I am, and it's hard to give up judgment, yeah, as a human being, but it's for me, if you take the witness, the higher perspective, you can see why people do what they do and not judge them for it in a way, you know. And then you have your choices of how you react to their supposed negativity or whatever, which is from their soul, what they're going through.  <br><br><br>So that brings me to my next question. You say that hardship is a gift, and it's important to feel our pain without any judgment. So we're talking about not only judging other people's hardships and the pain they are going through but our own, which I often hear people say they're going through something and, "I was so stupid," or "I shouldn't have done this," or "I shouldn't have," and they're judging.  <br>And when they pulled me out of the car, and I got beloving and kind to everyone, I got that that meant me too. So that does not include judging yourself. So can you explain to people why we choose, I mean, we're talking about we choose these big challenges to learn and evolve, but that we should not be judging other people's experience nor our own? That we need to understand when difficulties and challenges come to us, in some ways, we've chosen them for lessons to learn or whatever. Can you talk to us about that?  <br>Yeah, so the ego, which just means the part of us that's responding in fear and really trying to fix this big problem that's here nowвЂ”the big problem being that I'm separate from the whole, I have no power, I feel shameful, I feel unworthy of love, I don't have control, you know, that's how we feel deep down, right? When we're faced with such limitations, and we respond in fear to them, the ego is just the part of us that says, "You know what? I'll fix that. I'm going to grab on to whatever I can here. Here's some power."  <br>Judgment is a very simple and common example of that. The ego says, "Oh, you feel powerless here? Judge the person next to you. Look at how bad they are and how good you are. See, now don't you feel better?" That's not true power. It's fake power. It's based in fear. True power is alignment with spirit and everything that spirit is, everything it means, which is love, peace, freedom, joy, and acceptance, saying yes, actually being willing to process and experience the things in our lives.  <br>And that is an act of saying yes, not judging ourselves, but saying, "You know what? I feel pain. Feel it. Feel it to heal it." It's a phrase I love. I think that's one of the essays in my book, "Feel it to heal it." So when I was, when my body was 22, and I went through this health trauma, the physical shape that it took was that I received, I was poisoned by potassium.  <br>I was in China. I tried to move to China. I studied in China in college, tried to move to China after college. I was teaching English in a jungle. It was 110 degrees. I had a heat stroke, and then I was in the hospital for four days, and they gave me bag after bag after bag of potassium for four days straight. And something about my biology, my biology is very sensitive. I am way more sensitive than anybody else in so many ways. Like if you look at a bell curve, I'm like way out on the end.  <br>So this completely trashed my homeostasis. My biology was in so much pain. My nerves were screaming in pain all day every day, and I could not escape it. And my body didn't sweat for 11 months. Whoa, it couldn't. Anytime my body temperature would go up, I would just get sick. I would start vomiting. Like I couldn't cool off. But it led to many other things. I ended up, I have celiac disease, so and I had my lung collapse at the age of 26.  <br>This is related. It's a separate event, but similar fear where I had internal bleeding in my chest cavity, and so for 10 days, I was in the hospital with a tube in my chest where I had to lay there with this tape up and down my whole body that was itching and this large bore tube in my chest, and I couldn't escape, and it just hurt all the time. Like they stuck it in, and they left it there, and I'm like, "What do you mean you're leaving it in?"  <br>And in China, well, the China thing was at the age of 22. The lung collapse was at the age of 26. I was back. Feeling for your mother. I'm feeling for your mother who watched. Thank you. It was her precious son. You got it. She'll appreciate that because it was very hard for her.  <br>So I'm just saying, I've been through nerve, and that's just a couple. There have been other examples. I've been through many very painful health conditions, some that have lasted for many years. Okay, so I'm just lifting it up because what I found, so then I had post-traumatic stress in my 20s after the experience of 22, and I went through counseling, EMDR therapy for years, and I found that I had buried that fear under hundreds and hundreds of layers of ego crap, stories, justifications, escapes, distractions, judgments, anything I could think of to not face how I felt in that hospital bed in Chongqing, China, when I was dying of at the time low potassium, and I felt like there's absolutely nothing I can do to escape this terrible pain.  <br>After years of going through that counseling, I found it was by seeing and feeling each layer of my own BS and owning each layer of my own BS that I finally got to the root where it was so terrifying. I thought that fear will destroy me if I feel it, but I went in anyway, and I accepted that feeling, and it doesn't matter if I cried for hours and if I felt my whole body, no, it's okay. I felt the feeling that I rejected at 22, maybe when I was 28 or something.  <br>It was only after all that healing and processing at the age of 30 that I was able to have this awakening experience precisely because I said yes to it all, all the darkness. I didn't say no. Like basically, we don't have to say no to life. Life is not our enemy. Like do we know that? But the ego, the ego will really say no, but I don't like that. The ego says, "No, I want my little weapon of judgment," or "I want my little weapon of I'm special because of this."  <br>I mean, you can choose that if you like, but it doesn't actually work. You will still be miserable. I mean, I don't mean to like, I don't mean to like judge too broad of a brush. I'm just saying that as we align with rejection, we don't actually heal. Healing is about being so vulnerable and so willing to face our own crap and take ownership for our own lives, take ownership for our own pain, take ownership for looking at maybe how somebody abused us.  <br>Wow, that was terrible. Acknowledge it. Acknowledge how you feel. Take your power back actually by feeling because sometimes we, you know, in the case of abuse, like I know, I know at least a couple people who couldn't face for a long time that they had been abused because it would mean acknowledging how powerless they were.  <br>You see, it takes a lot of bravery to actually go in and face how you actually feel, but there's so much power there. And as we say yes to reality and yes to everything we've experienced, that is experience integration. You see, when you do that in this now, you do it for all the nows in all the lifetimes. Like it's like a deepening. Like you could, so to bring this back to your original question, I know this sounds maybe unrelated, but it's the same exact thing.  <br>Contrast is a useful creative tool, nothing more. So when we can say yes to the depths of contrast, even then, that's how deep our experience is capable of being and becoming. That is what we're here for. It's the most tasty thing for the soul that otherwise, I mean, it is immortal. It can't be threatened, but man, to have that taste of a truly real challenge, oh, that is powerful stuff.  <br>Well, I mean, I can liken it to just bring it down to what I would think of compared to your description. Mine is a little more layman description, yeah, but my, in my experience, my family abandoned me for 23 years, and I have healed so much. I've been in therapy and different modalities that I understand now what happened with my father. I understand what brought him to be the way he was. It doesn't take away what I went through, but I have left. I basically let go of judgment, and I tell people that's one of the reasons for this podcast because I tell people, "You have no idea the joy you can feel when you let go of that judgment of your story."  <br><br><br>Right, so you know, we have different stories, but they're the same in a way, right? Yes, so you know, so let me go to another one. We know that when we leave our physical bodies, we become so much more what you've been describing than we were in life. So in our, on the other side, are we like an orb of energy that can telepathically communicate and relate to whoever we want to relate to? Or, and I've also heard that there are different planes of existence depending on where our vibration is. Yes, did you find that?  <br>Yes, so when you ask what are we really, the actually the question is not directly answerable because consciousness itself, life itself, beingness itself, awareness itself, whatever word we want to use, transcends all form. So when we ask, "Are we a ball of energy?" That's a form. Are we this thing? Are we that thing? What did I look like? Tell me a look because now I'll be able to picture it.  <br>For forms arise within beingness, consciousness, not the other way around. So okay, but that being said, some practical words for what that stuff is: total love, total freedom, total joy, total peace, the fabric of bliss itself, the fabric of aliveness, life itself. That's what we are. That's really why they call it heaven. Yes, it's really, and that's to your other part of your question that there are reality systems that are much, much more full expressions of that true nature that I just described.  <br>They're, we call that high vibration because when you're there and when you shift to it, you can feel it as a vibration in the body of your awareness, and it is so blissful, and it's so home. It's like going home, whereas coming here is like leaving home and putting on a 2,000-pound coat or maybe going into outer space, and you're like clunking around outside the space station, barely able to do anything, and then you're like, "Oh, you know, no, that, that this is the more limited dead state actually being physical."  <br>And so, but it's not negative. It's just that this is just a highly limited state, a highly dense, crystallized state, that's all. So I'm getting that when we die, it's sort of like a graduation. We came through this incredibly difficult experience. It's taking off that 2,000-pound coat, and now you're like, "Oh my God, I can breathe again. Like this is amazing, and how did I ever forget that?" And it's very normal. It's very natural.  <br>Death is a release of the constraints. It's a wonderful thing. It's not something to be feared. I mean, it is, it's like, what would you be afraid of taking off all this weight that you've been trudging around, you know, at the end of a long day or working a week in a suit or something? Like no, you'd be great taking that off because you're free again.  <br>So now we've taken off this constraint. We've gone back home, and now we get a life review, but that life review also doesn't contain judgment, right? But we do feel the lessons we learned, and we feel how we affected others. Have I got that right?  <br><br><br>Yes, so yes, because okay, so here's this is going to sound really weird, but the other is you, okay? Because you, you are you. You're individuated. You'll always be you. Don't worry about not being you. Your individuation is precious and preserved, but you are simultaneously one with the whole. Oneness and individuation are not mutually exclusive.  <br>So when you pass over, other parts of the big you, the whole, other drops in the ocean are the other people you interacted with, and they, so you can experience, and you do experience exactly how you affected them because they're other parts of you ultimately, and you experience it from a first-person or third-person or multiple points of view experience for the purposes of learning, you know, because there's so much that can be learned when we see the whole thing at once.  <br>Now, wisdom is not automatic, actually. The vision is all there. The data is all there. The knowledge is there. The question is, even then, what do you do with it? Are you willing to drop even then, like wow, and take ownership, like wow, you know, I did some stuff, wow, I guess I did that now, and that, see, and that's why the guides are always so supportive of us during our life. It's not that they're judging us. They're loving us and supporting us.  <br>During the life review, it's the opposite of judgment because they know we're going to see what we did and how we affected exactly. We're going to go, "Oh my gosh, I did that. I can't believe I did that," you know, and then, so that's why they love us because they know that we're going to see, "Oh, I," because it's one thing to say, "I'm a good person." It's another thing to look and see, "Oh, I hurt a lot of people."  <br><br><br>Now, that's not judgment. It's simply data. It's just who you are, not even just who you were. That's important to lift up. Now, I want to lift up also here, it's really important to know what the most important thing that we're reviewing in the life review is. This is so important. It's quality of intention itself, not just the effect that we had on them. It's about the true why that we did what we were doing. That's what matters. The real why. That's what we're here to evolve and grow and learn from.  <br>So if we have a, like if we truly, like gosh darn mean it at the center of our heart, absolutely had a positive intention, and we ended up causing pain for somebody, that is seen as one package, you know. So the quality of intention, that purity of intention, it's seen and known, and it's beautiful, and it's celebrated, even if we can see, "Oh, that might have had this effect on them."  <br>So I'm lifting that up because quality of intention is first. It's not primarily about you produced 10 love widgets, and there they are, you know, in the form of some output, some physical effect. It's not even just about physical effect, but if you really choose love, it will mean serving the person next to you. It will mean smiling at the person at the store. It will mean giving a hug to the person who needs it. Like that's what I got. Be loving, kind to everyone. That was, you know, but Christian, what if a person's intention was really to hurt a lot of people? Like you have, then that's who they are.  <br>Then that's who they are. What happens now? They cross over. They see, and you know, the intention was, and they succeeded. They really hurt a lot of people. What's the process for them there?  <br><br><br>Well, let me just put it very simply, and I mean to make this sound neutral. They are who they are. So the reason I'm saying it that way is then they see, "Oh, I'm a fearful person," which means I am a yet unevolved person. That's all. It's not negative. Oh, it's about how evolved they are. So they, they do, they have a choice. They may have to experience different things to confront what they did and then to evolve, or they can stay stuck on a lower vibrational plane or whatever. Is that how it works?  <br>Yeah, so let me just put it this way. Like, let's say that you are addicted to some form expression as an ego pattern. What if you're a narcissist? Is that like okay? Narcissist, let's just take narcissism, and you really are always focused on yourself, and then you know, you have like, you can see, "Oh, I really was focused on myself, and I hurt a lot of people." Well, that's who you are. That means that you will resonate into experiences where that can be experienced and faced and healed.  <br>See, like we like to think karma is some system of judgment. It is. There is a, it is about cause and effect. Like if you are a narcissistic person, you will tend to have experiences where you then experience both the results of narcissism from others and the pain of your own narcissism in however many ways, whether in this life or in very low vibration thought-responsive realities that you yourself resonate into.  <br>It's not a punishment. It's that that's where you resonate. That's who you are. So you're going to just spend some time over here. It's really about choice, right? And so the laws of cause and effect that are karma allow us the opportunity to see and face our own unevolvedness. It's not a punishment. It's just that we tend to be guided into the unhealed, unintegrated parts of ourselves so that we can heal them and really work past them and really grow.  <br>It's ultimately, see, ultimately, it's a, healing is our destination, no matter what. I think of it that way. You can't not return to the full love, peace, freedom, and joy of your true nature one way or the other in the long run. It's not possible, but during our sojourns into worlds of form, whether it be this life or other thought-responsive reality systems that are low vibration for a time, you know, what we might call temporarily hellish experiences, we might resonate ourselves into those.  <br><br><br>Another way to put that is we might choose those, and someone says, "Well, why would I choose the hell of fear?" We are all doing it in many ways every day when we continue to choose fear. Like we don't think of it. We think it's the best choice because we'd rather not face our fear. So I'm just saying, basically, we have free will. So if you resonate into a low vibration perspective, then that's just who you are, and then you will do that until you will see, "Oh, fear is insanity."  <br>And what I mean by that is fear is painful. Ego is painful. Anger is painful. Self-judgment is painful. It's not great. We have to actually experience that firsthand and third-hand and second-hand, you know, before we really go, "You know what? I'm going to face all that and really choose love, really be my true authentic self all the way."  <br>Like sometimes you have to be so uncomfortable for so long. So a person who has chosen to really be in this low vibration situation, it's an unevolved, immature soul perhaps, and they have hurt all these people. Then they are presented with a choice also if they can come back and maybe experience what they did to others or yeah, or that because they're choosing to learn from that so that they can evolve and grow, right?  <br>So yes, some of these people are very, who are so hurtful, are just very unevolved souls who don't understand. So I'm sensitive to labeling these souls over here as unevolved. There are different levels of, or immature, or yeah, I mean, we could even just say less experienced, to be honest, you know. Like it, I'm a little sensitive to that because souls are beautiful and unique. Every one of us is so beautiful and unique. There's nothing wrong with any soul.  <br>You know, I'd be like saying a grapevine is less evolved than an oak tree. Like they're just different, you know. One yields grapes, and one is thick and strong. Okay, but yes, we may see that there is opportunity for us to integrate some type of experience. So in my case, I have experienced a lot of physical trauma in this life, which I know is a gift, okay, not a punishment, because it has given me the chance to see firsthand the absolutely terrible darkness of the fear that in the past had led me to be an egoic person and to damage many other people.  <br>That is a part of me. Like, like, basically, I'm responsible now for who I was then. It doesn't matter that it was a different life. It's still me. So now, in this life, it's just that, "Oh, I have a different context and a new chance, a valuable chance to really face that in a real new way and to really come to terms with it and process it."  <br>And by the way, I'm just feeling nudged to say this. The EMDR therapist that I worked with, she has no idea how she played a role in helping me do that. Like she performed a service of a human activity called EMDR therapy, just a structured way of working through your fears and seeing in the body where the resistances and the pain are.  <br>Oh, I've experienced therapy, yes, layer after layer. And so she has no idea that she was helping me facilitate an incredibly important personal deep healing and processing and integration that was so deep from even in previous lives. She has no idea, but how important was it that she did that?  <br>So I'm just lifting that up because there may be ways that you bless the person next to you that seems so small. Maybe you just smile at somebody in a certain way, and it gives them that little bit of light, that little bit of strength that they turn and face their own crap and heal a little bit. So I'm just lifting that up because when we choose love, we empower each other to heal. It's like a big snowball.  <br>That's true. The other thing I do want to say to people, and I think you'll resonate with this, Christian, is out of loving yourself though, if you come across someone who is so toxic or so in their ego, it's also loving for yourself that you, I call it detaching with love, that you can send that person love but that you can keep your distance so that you're protecting yourself.  <br><br><br>Yeah, and that, like, there's no benefit to you losing your peace if the person next to you is having a bad day and they flick you off on the street, you know. They're making an ego choice. They're just in fear. Do you need to lose your peace because they have fear? You don't need to, right? You don't actually need to. It doesn't really help when you think about it.  <br>If you walk into a room, and there are 20 people there, there are 20 different groups of experiences, soul groups, mind you, coming from so how are you worrying about what all of them exactly in their own yes, constructed world with the roles that they're playing? Exactly. I mean, here in our world of separation, you are an NPC to them, a non-player character. I mean, you just, like, from their point of view, in the world of the separate, you look like just a character out in the world.  <br>They can't really, I mean, actually, we do feel each other. We do actually connect and feel each other. That connection is always, always there. Our souls are always communicating all the time, but for someone who is very form-associated, it's almost invisible, that connection. So I'm just lifting that up because, like, then if they treat you poorly, are they really treating you poorly? No, they're actually quite blind to you. They're actually just focused on their own pain, their own fear, their own egoic response.  <br>It's like if your child has a tantrum and they yell at you, do you have to get mad at them? No. In fact, if it's a child, you can see easily, "Oh, this is a little silly. I'll love you anyway," or "I'll just come back later when you're done with your tantrum, and we can, you can do that calmly." Yeah, you can do that calmly. You don't even need to let it affect you. It doesn't affect you. There's no reason that other people, you know, acting egoic towards us, that we don't, that we can't choose the same thing, you know.  <br>So here's my last question for you, which is really the crux of everything that this podcast is about, Christian Sundberg. As we process and integrate our human experience, why is it important to heal, and how do we heal in various ways? Why should everyone consider having the courage to face themselves for their soul growth?  <br>Yes, because love and peace and joy and freedom are wonderful. That's why. And the reason I say that is because healing is synonymous with the integration of experience, and as we integrate out the depth, we return to the fullness of what we really are. We return to our authentic selves. Your authentic self is healed, joyful, full of life.  <br>So it's a little bit like asking, "Why would I want to be full of life? Why would I want to be joyful?" It's wonderful. And so it doesn't seem at first like facing the darkness is the way back to that, but actually, it is because in saying yes to everything, we integrate the experience, and the fullness of who we really are can rise up.  <br>Like, basically, you can be the authentic you. That's a very simple way to put this. Like, you, there's no actual reason you can't be the authentic you, but you have to heal the things that are coloring your experience, right? You have to, it's important to do.  <br>I liken it to dropping your backpack filled with your issues, and you heal them. Now you're not carrying them with you everywhere you go, and it gives you such a lighter, joyful experience.  <br><br><br>Yeah, part of healing is absolutely dropping the backpack because usually, we're holding on to the backpack because we think there's a really good reason to hold on to it, and usually, the reason for holding on to it seems better than the reason for not holding on to it. Do you know what I mean? So eventually, we say, "Oh, I'm actually going to put this down." Did you know that you can put down everything in the world of form? All the thoughts, all the must-dos, you can like, that's how deep that's how deep this peace goes.  <br>Wow, and how would one go about doing that? By continuing to heal. Yes, so the reason I'm not directly referencing healing is because healing is what happens when we do this, both physical healing and deeper, you know, psychological healing. It has to do with what it all boils down to: what quality of intention are we wielding in this moment?<br>
If something fearful or painful or negative arises, okay, first step, I see it. I see it for what it is. I'm not going to look away. I'm going to be acknowledging of it. How does it feel in the body? How does it feel in my mind? What is it connected to? And it might be connected to something really gunky, and then you follow that layer, and you, it's like EMDR, you know, you follow the layers down and see what they're connected to.  <br>Eventually, you find some really gunky stuff in there, then your own basement. The ego, of course, is going to say, "That's not my gunky stuff. That's someone else's gunky stuff." It's all your experience. Who else's experience is it than other than your experience? And so you can let go of those things. You can clean out the basement and drop that gunk. It just means acknowledging what's actually down there.  <br>You can't clean out the basement until you acknowledge what's in the basement. You have to see it and then acknowledge it and be willing to see it, be willing to see it, and that's all about choice, about choice, choice here in the physical, choice as a soul when you come to do that, to deal with that.  <br>And why is our true nature already joy? Is it because that's who we are on the other side? Would you like to talk to us about that joy?  <br>So the question actually can't be answered directly because it would imply that there is some reason, but it's just the nature of consciousness. It's just the nature of spirit. Spirit's very fabric is joy and love and peace and freedom. It is just what is. It is the most real thing. So anything that is not that means we've gotten stuck in something that's that we're not, some story, some form association, some negative self-perception that the world seems to have proved to us, some judgment, you know.  <br>And so it's not really, "Why is our true nature joy?" Our true nature simply is joy. Consciousness simply is. It doesn't actually have a precedent. It's just the thing that is, and when we fully get in touch with that through saying yes, fully accepting this life in this moment, and fully really being our authentic selves through form, so quality of intention is first, shines through form, then that joy just rises up on its own.  <br><br><br>You know what I mean? It's just what we are, and then we see that the physical is an expression of that joy. It's not actually this terrible machine meant to crush and kill you. It's just a very daring, bold, ambitious creative exercise that we've all done together to create this environment where we might actually feel separate and see what is yielded from that experience.  <br>But our true nature always remains what it is, and that's like the one thing I love to lift up. What is our true nature in all this? Because if we can just be reminded of that, even if we hear that and we go, "You know what? That pisses me off because I don't feel that way. I feel mad." I'm at, "Okay, okay, that's fine. Look at that. Find out why. What did life seem to prove to you that seems so dire as to why you can't face that or be joyful?"  <br>You see, it's all about how we choose to meet this present moment. So I know all that sounds a little abstract, so I'll just boil it down to one idea: simply choose in this moment how to interact with this moment. Simply choose more openness, acceptance, more love to the person next to you, love within yourself, more freedom, like not have-tos but cans, you know, more joy, more like, "I'm going to have fun with this, even if I look like a silly child or something."  <br>What if, and you say, "What if I really want to go take a nap?" Then go take a nap. It's okay, you know. If we can choose that in this moment and listen to our bodies, listen to our hearts, listen to our minds, work with it, work with life, work with the flow of life, then we will find that joy is here and shines through all this form.  <br>That's beautiful, Christian. I have to say that I am feeling tremendous joy interviewing you today and sharing you with, thank you, all of our wonderful audience. It's really marvelous. I deeply, deeply, I mean, you're so special. I deeply appreciate you being here today.  <br><br><br>As we close, I would like to share this eye-opening quote from your illuminating book, A Walk in the Physical, with our Grief and Rebirth Podcast audience because it really touched me. And the quote is actually there too:  <br>"Death is the end of the physical experience and a lifting of the constraints that consciousness brought into in order to be human. Death is not the end but in fact is a wonderful transition to higher states of being. Metaphorically, death is like taking off a constraining spacesuit and returning to the freedom of what one really is. Thus, when someone we love experiences the death of their body, let us remember our love for them. Let us take consolation that we have not truly lost them, for they exist right now, not as less than they were, but in fact as much, much more."  <br>Christian, I actually wrote that the day my uncle passed from Earth. Oh my gosh, and I really felt it. I really felt his presence, though he wasn't fully, his body had died. It's there's just some transition stuff that happens, but anyway, yeah, thank you.  <br>The thing that I really want to lift up there is, "They exist right now. They are." And I mean, this is not weird. This is not strange. They really do exist right now, and they're all around us, and they know what's going on in our lives, and it's a beautiful thing, and it takes away the fear of death, truly.  <br>And for me, in my life as Irene, I focus on having as much joy and love in my life as I can until that time when physically I die, and I go back to who I am, and that is, that's that is the life well-lived, right? And that is that that is success, right? And people will say to me, "Irene, you have such an unusual attitude," but I like you, I had this awakening, and it has made all the difference in my life.  <br>And from my heart, Christian, I want to thank you because you're doing such illuminating work, and you're helping people know and understand our true nature and the importance of love in this human journey of ours. And thank you also for this amazing, incredibly enlightening interview. I know we've helped so many people today.  <br>As I like to say, to be continued.<br>Thank you again, Christian.<br>To be—thank you so much, Irene. Much love to you.<br>Thank you. Much love back, Christian.<br>Many, many blessings, and perhaps we will do—perhaps we will do this again. It's just been a wonderful—I'm very grateful, I'm really grateful.<br>Thank you so much.

There are so many close calls where I almost didn't make it. You are getting a completely new personality, new soul, new experience, and you come out of Earth. The physical is very dense. It gives us the opportunity to face our rejection. If you're the real you, you will know bliss. <br>My kid's life is like a giant rock tumbler. When a rock pops out, you don't just throw away the rock. You put it back in the rock tumbler, and it gets smoother. Keep putting it back until it's efficiently polished, and then enjoy the beauty. Perhaps there is no good answer, but from a higher perspective, my best attempt to answer this question would be to say...<br>I've tried a number of energy healing modalities, and while I am highly energy sensitive, I don't always feel a benefit from these practices until I tried refractive healing with Jamie. During my session, I could feel a gentle healing light energy flowing downward from my crown, soothing and supporting my physical and mental health. I would like to share this gift with you. Book your free distant healing session with Jamie today at refractivehealing.com. Thank you to refractive healing for partnering with me in this video.<br>I am more excited about today's episode than ever. I'm here today with Christian Sundberg, Ary Muratova, Aaron Green, and Rebecca WS for pre-birth experiencers. Today is extra special for me because I also have pre-birth experiences, and we are going to dive right into the top five questions that you guys sent into me.<br><br><br>We'll start with question number one: Do we always have free will, or are there situations where souls are forced to incarnate on Earth?<br>Christian: Yeah, a couple of things about free will. One was that I was point-blank told that free will is extremely important and that that's like a core part of our existence. But that being said, one thing I saw pretty clearly in my pre-life memories is that we make all sorts of agreements before we come here. Once we agree to some of this stuff, we're obliged to fulfill those agreements. <br>One example I wanted to share was that I didn't just see some of my own agreements being made but also other people. One particular agreement stands out where this person was looking for a certain benefit of the life that they were about to lead, and they made some arrangements to benefit them. As a consequence or as an agreement, that agreement spanned two lifetimes. It wasn't just for this next lifetime but also one after that, and they're going to be obliged to fulfill that agreement that they've already made.<br>I don't see that as a violation of their free will to be compelled to follow through with something they've previously agreed to. So the way I take it is that probably these people who feel like they're being forced or pushed back during their near-death experience, they don't want to come back. I can certainly understand that, but they're compelled to come back because they need to fulfill something that they've already agreed to. So that's my take on it.<br>If we ever were forced to do something, which I don't think is how it works, but hey, maybe then it would be for our benefit. It's nothing too far or anything. It's just something that would benefit us, kind of like when you make a kid go to school. Maybe they don't want to go to school, but you make them go anyway. But I don't think that's the case. I think free will is paramount, and that we're just being compelled to follow through with agreements we previously made.<br>Ary: May I comment on that?<br>Christian: Oh yeah, go ahead.<br>Ary: Thanks. So the agreement is also made with free will. So I agree very much because it's still the same you that's deciding. One thing I'd point out is the levels of the self become difficult to understand from the human perspective because it's like a subset of the whole, but it's still you. It's still the same soul making the choices. So if you, with a broader perspective, agreed to something, it's possible that you at the lower level, so to speak, who may not have full awareness of the whole, is following through on something that you chose. <br>It may seem to the local portion of the self, the personality portion, that it's not being given a choice when really there's always ultimately choice at the soul level. There is always ultimately choice because, at the soul level, we are a part of source, God, and so the sovereignty is yours already. There's no greater authority, so to speak. So ultimately, at the deepest level, it is always choice. It's always free will. It's just that now we have to shine that free will through choice-making in the context of the personality, whether that be an earthly context or a local reality system that's still close to Earth vibrationally. But we may have different constraints, but it might still be the personality portion of the self. It doesn't really matter so much. We still are making choices and wielding our free will intention from and through that lower level of the self.<br><br><br>I just want to say I agree with that. Through the studies of NDEs, I recently did an interview on my channel as well with Wes, and he had like a void-type NDE experience. His experience was about being very hesitant to return to Earth and everything, and how the guide, the guides that they have, are there to answer any questions, to remind them of the commitments and the promises. Sometimes they're not allowed to remember exactly some of those things as they come back. So it's like you're missing a piece of the puzzle, and you're thinking, why did I say yes, even though I was hesitant? Maybe it's because that part has been removed from coming back and what they remember about it because then that would be like probably giving away too much or change their growth experience while they're down here again.<br>So it makes sense that there's actually like a lot of feelings that remain with these individuals that they didn't want to come back, they didn't want to go back, they felt forced, it felt like they were being heavily influenced and talked into it. Yet there could be things that may have been removed so that's something to consider, that they might not have an active memory over some of those things that they promised or whatnot.<br>I want to give Melissa and Ary a chance to comment, but I just want to say one thing. One of the main values of the physical is that we are enabled to commit ourselves into a constraint set in which it seems like our power has been removed. It seems like we can't, like once you get into the roller coaster, you can't get out. That is precisely where the value lies because now we're forced to make decisions under constraint so that we can face our own fear and grow. So it's not that that's a bad thing. It's actually kind of built into the design of the simulation, you could say.<br>Even in my pre-birth experience, I remember this guide coming to me over and over, asking, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" That was not meant as force. It was more like reminding me of my own intention, my own commitment, my own journey. It was more like, "Oh, just reminding you, this is the journey." It's like, "Oh yes," because it's such a huge and vast opportunity that the physical is offering. Sometimes we just need to be kind of nudged back into that. At the personality level, that might seem like there's no choice, but actually, there is.<br>Ary: I just must say I'm so happy and enjoying everything, just hearing different perspectives. I totally agree, and I feel right now my mind being expanded. But when it comes to free will and people feeling forced to reincarnate on Earth, I feel sorry for that. I feel sorry that they perceive things this way, and it is something that bothers them. However, personally, from my own pre-birth experience, I haven't witnessed anybody being forced. Obviously, I can't speak on their behalf, but from what I believe and what I've seen and what I feel, there are things we don't know and we will never know. There are parts that we've forgotten for a reason, and there are parts we will never know for a reason as well.<br>It helps for people that feel pushed to be here. Maybe if you change your perspective on that and look at that memory as something that reminds you of your free will and to explore what free will is, to experiment in this lifetime with your free will now, maybe that would change the experience on Earth without getting attached to that memory of being forced. Because all you have is now in this life. Even though maybe you were forced, maybe you were not forced, you will never find out. You may find out, you may never find out in this lifetime, but what you can focus on and shift your perspective in this solution and live this life in this life and experience and fully experiment with your free will because we have free will to say no, say yes, your truth, passions, and that free will creates your destiny to move forward. The destiny still has free will, so keep on going.<br>I would say obviously I do feel and understand where people are coming from with the feeling of being forced and not wanting to reincarnate on Earth. However, when you are on the other side, you don't feel the same way you feel on Earth. So everything you're feeling about that free will, the question you have, is coming from your human self, which Christian has mentioned before. It is because everything has been filtered through the earthly sensation and earthly experiences. That's why you feel some sort of resentment or a negative perception on things because you are coming from this place from the human mind. However, I would say have faith that there is more that you don't know and just keep a question. That would be my take.<br>I love everything that you guys shared so much, and I'll just briefly say that I have a pre-memory of fully choosing my life and being very excited about it and thinking, "How could anything go wrong? I'm just going to go in and get everything right, and this is going to be fantastic." Then I also had a spontaneous out-of-body experience at the age of 18 after living several difficult years here, not trauma to the extent that some people experience, but I was very depressed and suicidal and faced some challenges. I did not want to come back from that experience. I wanted to stay. Had I been given the choice, I probably wouldn't have returned.<br>So it kind of highlights what you guys are saying, which is that there could be two different levels to this where a higher part of our soul is choosing an experience for whatever reason, for our growth or for contributing to the expansion of the universe or just to have the experience of love in physical form. But the so-called lower, although I don't like that word, part of maybe our personality or our identification, the character that we're playing here on Earth, may not have that full higher perspective or memory of what we chose once we're experiencing the effects of the veil here.<br>There's also questions to be asked about what free will is and how far it extends in certain scenarios. For instance, here on Earth, we could argue that we all have free will, but there can be a certain extent where there may be limitations on free will once you've chosen a certain path. There's certain things that we don't understand or we can't fully see here, and we might want our team or our guides or higher power, who is not in a limited physical form like we are here, to step in and kind of guide us and help us make the right choices.<br>The physical is very dense, and so that just means it gives us the opportunity to face our rejection. Rejection meaning we have fear. So if you think of it like in the context back to the original point we were discussing, it's about having the opportunity to process fear, which is synonymous with the growth of love, what we really are, which is love. Because when we integrate fear and process it, it no longer is the expansion of what's real, which is love. So the denseness of the physical, which includes all the limitations, all the context, all the veiling, all the physical constraints, all the laws of physics, all the laws of our society that we've created for ourselves, like taking tests to go to do surgery, that's all part of the context through which we get to make choices.<br>So free will means we get to make choices that we can identify. We have to be able to identify it as a choice, and then it has to be permissible within the rules, within the rule set of the simulation, you could say. But within that, we're completely free to choose anything we like, and our choice-making arises from a quality of intention that is either more in alignment with love or true nature or fear, which is association with a non-native negative self-perception and the rejection of it at its root.<br>So it all ties together because when we talk about, "Oh no, I'm not happy. I don't want to go back," or "I'm not making light of it. I'm not making light of the rigors that are available here. I'm really not." But when we reject that, it's because we yet have fear, and we've come precisely, well, I mean, I'm speaking for myself too, because I came to face fear, but that's part of the name of the game here, is the opportunity to accept something that we once rejected.<br>So like, how can we have the opportunity to accept it if we're not sometimes nudged either by ourselves or by a friend helping us to have the opportunity to face it? You know, like the reason it's rejected is because it seems bigger than us right now, the circumstance, the illness, the pain, whatever seems bigger than what we can handle right now until we finally turn and face it in a new way and accept it and really process it. So sometimes it benefits us to be nudged to do that, and we always have the choice. It's always free will, like Aaron said. Free will is like the name of the game. What choices are you going to make? That's the bread and butter of what we're doing here is making choices, and it's beautiful, the opportunities even in the rigor.<br>Thank you so much. We've heard from near-death experiencers that Earth is the hardest planet to incarnate into because of the contrast. What benefit does experiencing this contrast offer to the rest of the universe? In other words, how does our experience in the physical affect the greater web of life beyond our species?<br><br><br>Christian: So I'm getting a feeling that it's great that we're here, that we're getting this opportunity, but also this Earth experience has involved so many other groups and what we think are extraterrestrial groups and things like that, especially with its history and everything. I know personally that I've lived lives in these different groups, and now I'm experiencing a human life, and therefore, it's what's termed as a star seed or whatnot. So I can see this interaction. I can almost see myself multi-dimensionally in that I'm living this human life doing what I'm doing, but I'm also remembering these other lives and the interactions of myself.<br>I know this is mind-blowing, but like myself as an Arcturian, I feel that connection to that multi-dimensional other life self or what have you, and I feel the guidance from that side as well and the learning that they're experiencing by helping during this time on Earth. So it's very mind-blowing sometimes because I feel like it's all these different people or these different beings, and you're understanding the interaction and how all of it is involved and how it all brings everything closer together in this sort of like almost play or act.<br>It's like even from that side of things where they're maybe serving as a guide or something like that, it's still like a part in a play. So it's very like, yeah, I mean, it's just source, and then all these little characters, you know, and it's like how can we not be affecting other parts of the universe and everything just from like the whole phrase, "As above, so below." And then even like within ourselves, we have our own universe even down to our atom particle. So we have a universe within our own bodies as well, and it's just like you see this mirroring happen, and it's a beautiful progression or whole and seeing how all of it just kind of creates this universal dance together, really.<br>Aaron: Yeah, I think as we progress spiritually, we begin to realize that we're part of something bigger and that all humanity is connected together. But if we take it to the next level, it should be kind of not too hard to accept that it's not just all of humanity but all of the life on Earth. We're all connected. We're all part of God's plan. And then if you take it to the next level, which I think it's not too hard, it's not just the life on this Earth but the whole universe. All of us are connected together as a part of God, and what we do, how we act, how we think, it affects the people around us, and it actually affects everyone on the planet.<br>Not just all the people but also all the animals, and then I think on a deeper level, it's not just our planet but the whole universe and all of God. What we think, what we say, what we do, it all affects more than just us. So when we're able to bring those positive Godly traits into the world, love and kindness, that sort of thing, then we can make things better for everybody. And if we bring something negative in, then we're making it more challenging for everyone.<br>The analogy I think of is if you throw a rock into a pond, the ripple goes out and it ends up affecting every drop of water in that entire pond, and then ultimately it comes back to that rock, and it gets the end result of its own actions. So that's kind of my two cents on it.<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, in summary, it's one thing. There is no separation really. It's one thing, the one source, the one all that is expressing itself and affecting itself in a multitudinous fractal expression of manifest creation. So it's all one thing. The whole idea of separation is kind of non-native. So we assume separation, and then we ask how these separate things affect each other, but we're already coming from an incorrect assumption that there's separation. I mean, it seems to be on the surface, of course, or I mean, we're really going all out into the experience of separation here. We really feel separate from each other. That's what Earth's all about.<br>But truly, our true nature, consciousness itself, is always connected. It's like metaphorically, it's like one big ocean. And I love your metaphor, Aaron, about the rock in the water sending out ripples, and it affects all the water. It has no choice because it's one pond. So if all that is is like the ocean, you're connected to the whole ocean. So everything you choose, every intention, every thought, every action, of course, whether it be locally through physical interaction or in thought-responsive systems, the interaction of your thoughts with other thought forms, whatever the layer of interaction, it's all connected and affecting each other.<br>Even the experience of distance is an illusion, right? We tend to think like, "Oh, I'm on Earth, and then there's this really far away place called this world where there's another civilization." No, no, no. There's consciousness having an experience of this place and that place, and that consciousness is one thing. It's all connected. So there's not actually a distance that we need to span to affect each other. That's not a really local non-native level that we built. It's like a simulation, you know.<br>Thank you for hearing your perspectives. I truly appreciate it, and I'm enjoying listening to all of you. In terms of how hard it is on Earth, from my own experience, when I had an out-of-body experience and I woke up on the other side, I was shown my life up till the moment then. I think I was 23 or 24. I was shown my life, a literal mini life review, and I was given lessons and other people's lessons I have been part of.<br>In the bigger contrast, I was shown that there is always a balance, no matter how hard it is for you or for others. There is always a balance that balances everything out. The suffering, the heaviness of Earth, everything is balanced out. It was shown that we are not about going to Earth. It's about coming out of Earth that is helping the universe expand. It is about coming out of this. You now don't remember who you were before for a reason. You are getting a completely new personality, new soul, new experience, and you come out of Earth. That expands and helps the balance to be there.<br>There is a giant balance of web. It's there, and it helps. It keeps growing. Let's say your life is hard. That hardness, that suffering, is going to help other souls to balance, to find the balance that it's possible to manipulate the energy on Earth. Earth is dense compared because I've had multiple out-of-body experiences, and manifesting on other realms is so much easier than on Earth. But it is not impossible. It is a bit slower on Earth, but once you manipulate the energy you are giving your thoughts, it is actually easy. It is easy to live in peace. You just don't label life as easy or hard. You just take it as it comes, and you balance. You focus on your energy where you are putting it in. That's when you know how to play the game of Earth, and that helps other souls that are coming. Your experience will help them.<br>But it's the thing about it is I can talk about it, but when all of us are out of this, we will see it for ourselves. We've just forgotten it for now, but we'll see the benefits and how it's serving in a bigger picture. Yeah, I can just say in one sentence, it's all about the balance that we are creating and expansion, and it's all about coming out of this place and growing because we are loving beings. Love means growth. We are creators. We love to create. We love when you love something, it grows. You keep on creating, whether it's art or music. You keep on expanding that thing. It keeps living on. It is all about living on and expanding. So you love this planet, so you come here to help expand the whole picture.<br>That was awesome. Oh my gosh. I'd like to echo something that you said there when you were talking about it's not about coming to Earth. It's about coming out of Earth, and that's sort of where my thoughts have been on this also. So there's this Sanskrit term, Sat Chit Ananda, which you guys are probably familiar with, which means being, consciousness, bliss. It's this idea of the one being aware, becoming aware. It's hard to talk about it without using time language, but it's this idea that God or source is being what God is and also becoming aware and experiencing that, and that experience of God self is bliss.<br>So if we think about this entire physical experience and all the universes and multiverses that have been created as part of that experience of source knowing and experiencing the bliss of itself, then what I've gathered from near-death experiencers and pre-birth experiencers who I've asked this question to is that something about going down into the depths of the contrast and experiencing the opposite of that bliss for the purpose of being able to come up out of that, remember who you are, and which allows us to experience more light, more bliss, and higher levels of consciousness.<br><br><br>So it's all part of the one thing knowing and experiencing more and more and more of the bliss of existence, the bliss of what it is. Another aspect of it is since we are all part of the one thing, as all of you so eloquently said, when one of us has that experience, we make that blueprint available to every other consciousness in existence. It's like giving them the pathway. Here's what this experience is like. On some level, we have access to that now, and so that's how it benefits the rest of creation. Whether it's world, we've now made more bliss, higher levels of bliss, and deeper levels of existence available to the rest of the universe.<br>Oh man, beautifully said. Yeah, and I just get this visual of people almost searching a library on the other side and able to dive into your life and your experience and even see almost like a movie or maybe like an actual, you feel the emotions with it going along with it and able to learn from that perspective because, I think, don't they talk about some souls and how they haven't taken Earth lives? Not all souls have, so perhaps they use that as a preparedness or a studying or something like that.<br>I've always had a memory of an experience like I could be in another soul's presence, and you could almost just expand yourself and kind of let them in and experience what you went through, maybe on Earth or in a different whatever, and it's almost like you could swap or exchange information. I don't know. I just have a memory of that. I miss that so much. I know it was so easy because you didn't have to explain anything. You just had to be like, "Here," and then the next, it's all telepathic. It's instant, and the being is like, "I understand, I understand," like yeah, you know, and they're able to witness that growth or the change or I don't know. There's just so much to share with other beings when we get back, and there's not the confusion or the misunderstanding here. You know, it's just right, perfect communication where you can communicate thoughts and ideas and the whole thing at once. Here, take the whole.<br>I don't know. I keep like this is my little prop. It's just rose quartz, but it's so smooth. It's so polished. You know, Earth life is aggravating. You put a stone, something rudimentary or just rough or whatever, and you agitate it a little bit. Earth life, you know, and you come out brighter and shinier and maybe a little bit more polished. You know, it's the same kind of thing. Nobody wants to like nobody really wants to go through that because it's not pleasant, but it's the outcome, right?<br>Yeah, I love that. Until my kid's life is like a giant rock tumbler, and all these souls are in there, and as they rub against each other, they polish each other. You know, when a rock pops out, let's say it's not smooth enough, you know, you don't just throw away the rock. You put it back in the rock tumbler. It goes again, and you just keep putting it back until it's sufficiently polished, and then you can put it on the shelf and enjoy the beauty. There you go. That's a great metaphor.<br>Yes, Melissa, there was one thing you said earlier about the addition to what is. I couldn't say it as eloquently as you just said it, but I just wanted to make a brief comment. In one of my experiences, I was aware that if in a lifetime you could even experience one novel thing, like even just have one novel thought or experience life in one unique way, then your whole life would have been worth it because you've added to what's available and to what is. And that's a wonderful service. It's like performing a gift, a service, just being able to do that.<br>And that requires, not requires, but in this case, it means that we have adopted a set of constraints that permit us to potentially do that. You know, and then Rebecca, to your comment about seeing another soul's experience, absolutely. Metaphorically, it's like taking movies off of the shelf, and you can watch the movie firsthand, and it's not like the free will version because you're just watching the recording, you know, in this metaphor. But there's a lot of learning available there, you know, and a lot of us tap into that without knowing what we're doing actually too, like in what we call the Akashic records, just the databases of all the information of all the experience that's actualized in many paths that have not actualized, and it's all there for review and learning, and it's all valuable.<br><br><br>Question number three: We've heard that souls line up for an opportunity at physical life, but once we get here, it is so hard, and we forget what we're supposed to be doing. How can we ensure we get this life right? In other words, is there a way to master this experience?<br>Christian: I like Ary's face as a response, the facial expression she just made. Well, if your question had one correct answer, then it wouldn't be the entire universe of billions of years of experience to integrate it all. Good point. It has a lot of depth. I mean, I think the most simple, it's a huge personal question, and each soul is so unique, but like the simplest most concise way I feel to put that is love, love rather than fear. Because love can mean so many things. It's just one word, and we're just lacking on words. We've got like one word, and it's love, you know, but it means so many things, so many qualities of intention, kindness, and compassion, and strength, and expression, and creativity, and celebration, and all these things, you know, that it means like that all of that is what we're here to actualize, grow, know firsthand, expand.<br>And so like the other side of that coin is like I mentioned before, like processing fear, which just means the parts of us that like we've rejected this life. So we've got these high constraints, so I feel like a significant portion of what you asked about is where have we rejected life? Like where are we where are we miserable, and then we go and we take ownership for that, and we actually seek to actually go into the dark closet and face it and feel it and process it because really our consciousness is deeper than all that deepest crap, and so it can be integrated. Like we really can use this huge contrast for an incredible amount of expansion and integration of experience.<br>And that's a very personal process for everybody. It means different things for different circumstances, different types of vibrations we're here to process. I mean, it's a very rich question, of course, but I think simply to choose love rather than fear, whatever that means in our lives, and to try to integrate the experience of being here exactly where we are, like not like some big crazy thing, like where are you in your life right now, like right today on a Friday night, you know, like what are you experiencing today? That's what we're here to process and experience and know and see if we can like choose love even here, choose peace like today, even a little bit in the mirror looking while you're brushing your teeth kind of thing, you know, that's where you know, that's how we do it.<br>Aaron: Yeah, I don't view it necessarily as a right way to live life. I don't view it in terms of right or wrong. I view it more as the easiest way for you and others. You know, how can you make this journey that we're going to be going through exactly as easy as possible? Exactly. And like Christian said, love, you know, love God and love other people, and that if you make an attempt to live like that, you're going to make your journey a little bit easier. And what does that really look like in detail? And I saw something recently that really connected with me. You know, how do you love God? Well, God is love. God is kindness. God is compassion. And when you love kindness or compassion or honesty or respect, you're actually loving God. Like that's just how it works because that literally is what God is.<br>You know, how do we love others? Well, we through acts of service, empathy, respect, forgiveness, kindness, compassion, and when we exercise all of those things, we are getting it closer to what I think people view as right, which to me means you're taking the easier path, and you're not going to have to go through quite as much difficulty to learn a lesson if you willingly accept that, "Hey, I should be a good, kind person and do the things that I know are right." And I think that's what getting life right looks like when you basically try to live those loving characteristics in action.<br>And you know, I think we're all here. We're all on this planet. We're all making mistakes. That's just part of what it is to be on this Earth. And not even mistake, but taking the more difficult path. That's really what I how I view it. And you know, if we want to take an easier path, just live those loving traits as well as we can.<br>Christian: That was a great comment, Aaron. Like love makes sense. It's sane, and fear is insane. Like you could, it's not like, like you said, I agree 100%, it's not like the right way or the wrong way. It's like do you want to do it painfully or less or not, you know, like exactly. It's yourself. Like the other person is yourself too, so do you want to hurt them or not? No, it doesn't make sense to hurt them. It makes sense to love them.<br><br><br>Rebecca: Yeah, I kind of wanted to address the mastery part of the question. So I think that's just made kind of like on a soul level before coming down, if that soul wants to master a certain specific whatever it is when in their life, and you can easily kind of tell that in some people's lives when they come down, and they're you know, a virtuoso at like the piano or an instrument or some kind of skill or maybe mastering and going through human emotions or learning about healing by living a life of chronic pain or disease or something like that. Maybe they're learning something like that that's helping them master a certain specific area that their soul wants to explore.<br>But then I also see other lives that are just like, "I'm just going to come here and be a support to this person," and you know, kind of just enjoy Earth life. You know, I'm not taking this one so seriously that I have to do this whole to-do list of things that I need to learn or whatever. I've seen these different themes per person, and you can just tell by the people that you've met in your life. They seem just, you know, the way that their lives have gone, and the lessons that have been brought to them and everything. There's also the kind of life that's like, "Okay, I'm on the diving board. I've never dove before. Let's just do it," and they belly flop, and it hurts. You know, they're like, "I'm just going to jump into this Earth life, and whatever happens, happens." You know, and they learned just from that experience, but there was no mastery involved in that. Right? That was just like, "Let's do it. Let's jump into it." You know, but it's still valuable.<br>And you know, I again, I just want to reiterate like I think it really comes down to what that soul wants to experience mastery-wise before they come down here. And again, that is all part of that free choice. Maybe they just really want to explore that option because it's a direction they feel like they want to go. Maybe they feel that that rounds out a part of their soul purpose or something. So yeah, that's a great question.<br>Ary: It is a funny question in terms of mastering the life. Help you master the life and take this life lightly because you will never master this life. This life is so short. It will take your lifetimes to master whatever you want to master here. And just do your best because we are all doing our best and teaching each other. The second thing I would say is treat everybody you meet as your teachers. You meet everybody in this life, and you are their teacher. They are your teacher. Always respect them and have compassion. Compassion is something I would say that will take you through this life lightly.<br>And love everybody. And I know this love word, as Christian mentioned, has such a big meaning that we just have this whole letter, love, and it doesn't fully explain loving somebody means you accept them, you forgive them, you support them, you cherish them, you appreciate them, you respect them. You don't manipulate, you don't hurt them, you don't betray, you don't control, you don't manipulate. These things aren't love. The opposite of it is love. So once you give love to yourself, you'll be able to love other people and also learn from them openly with an open heart and open mind.<br>When it comes to forgetting things, you never forget. You never forget who you are. You never forget anything when you incarnate. The way you are living this life is you remembering actually. So you are living and remembering everything you've gathered up till this moment now. Every wisdom and insight is you remembering through different life experiences. So you never forget. It's always in your heart. It always guides you. You've always got the support from your spirit guides, the universe, and from people that are here on Earth as your teachers. And if you feel lost, you can always ask questions, and answers will be revealed. You can always ask because everybody's a teacher.<br>You can go ask Melissa, "What do you think about this?" and she'll tell me something that will help me, that will give me a different perspective. I can just like that. You can go to different people and see that you are one. We are always learning together. I would say, and just time who you want to be in every moment. Wake up and ask yourself who you want to be, how do you want to talk, how do you want to act, what kinds of beliefs you want to have, how you want to treat others, and how you want to be treated. And it's a continuous lesson of becoming who you want to be in this world, in this lifetime.<br>So I would say give up the mastery and live as a beginner because this life is our learning to be honest. I'm learning to drive. I'm a beginner in everything. I'm learning to cook, and all of those things. Treat this life as a beginner. You're creating a completely different perspective, and you are serving in a big collective purpose on a giant level. But don't focus too much on that. Just focus on what you can do right now and who you are right now and what you can do that will help you a lot to quite fully.<br>I've heard someone say angels can fly because they take everything lightly. They don't carry baggage. So don't get attached to anything and accept life as it is. Life has a rhythm. It has ups and downs and twists and circles and everything zigzags because life is life. Life is for living. Life is not for mastering. And whatever you take out of this life, that is it. That's what you take out of this life. But don't worry about it much. This end, the learning, focus on what you can do and who you want to be. That's what I would say.<br>All of you made such profound points to me, and each of them slightly different but in like bringing a different perspective of the same thing that I think everybody is saying. And I would also add that the great masters, like the great Hindu masters, the great mystics, different traditions have talked about how the way to become self-realized or really to awaken from the dream is to become very, very present. And like each of you are saying with your own words, it's about not trying to master the experience. Ary, that was such a great point. It's not that there is one right or wrong way to do this and that there is or there is one specific purpose that we're all here to do.<br>Like Rebecca, like you were saying, there's so many different reasons that people could have chosen different experiences, but it's about actually just being present in the experience, which comes back to Christian's point, which is love. And I think that's what we're all saying because love is accepting what is. It's one of my favorite spiritual teachers, Adyashanti, says enlightenment is just having a loving relationship with everything, and that includes yourself, your thoughts, your emotions, the thoughts and emotions of others, not judging it as a right or wrong or a good or bad experience but just being present with it.<br>And I think that if there's one way to master the experience, then that would probably be it, is to just be present in the experience without having any attachment or judgment to it and without having any attachment or judgment to whether or not we want to be here or come back, which is another thing that comes up.<br>Does anyone have anything else to say about that topic, or should we move on?<br>Christian: I'll add a quote by Rumi: "Wherever you are, whatever you do, just be in love. Be fully in love with everything in the crazy."<br><br><br>All right, question number four: Many people understand the necessity of contrast for growth and yet question the degree of suffering that we endure here. So in your experience or opinion, why do we have to suffer to the extreme degree that we do on Earth?<br>Christian: I feel it's never a "have to." You know, a lot of times when this question is asked, it's why do we have to be put through so much misery? So like, you know, like fear is misery is a simple way that you could put that. Like when we reject life and when we associate with ego and when we like become the thing that we're not, which is this little small person who's powerless but is really striving to grab some fake power however we can by judging the person next to us or getting some identity or some money or whatever else, that's suffering.<br>You know, when we associate with thinking, thinking itself, the small "I," the small "I am just this person who has to do this thing," that is like a form of suffering. And our universe gives us the opportunity to fall really deeply into that because it's so dense. It has the ability to prompt the opportunity to prompt potentially very negative self-perceptions. So what I mean is like I feel powerless, or I feel unworthy of love, or I feel not free. Those are some of the really big ones on Earth, the themes that are really deep in us. Those are not true.<br>And so like when we but when we believe that and then when we act in fear as a response to that, that causes all sorts of shenanigans, all sorts of suffering. So I'm pointing that as suffering versus pain. You know, physical pain itself will happen within the human experience. It's part of the context. But even great physical pain, I know this sounds contentious, the ego may not like this, but even great physical pain is actually neutral when it arrives. It's not actually charged yet. It's just a sensation. We apply the meaning. You see, we apply the suffering when we buy into the fear-based interpretation.<br>So it's not that it has to be that. It's that where we have fear, we may get wrapped up in something that we're not really deeply, and that can hurt like hell. So really, I find I feel that question is synonymous with why do we have such an opportunity to have such a deep experience of potential expansion? You see, like but but ultimately, like I think it's really, really, really important to point out though, like the fundamental substrate of existence, the thing that always remains is love and peace and joy. Like that's what we're made of. Even when the contrast may seem ridiculously extreme, the substrate of all that experience is still what it is. It never actually can be truly changed or challenged. It only can apparently be deeply challenged, and what we're doing here is pushing the boundaries for how far we can create a simulation that challenges us in that way.<br>But are we ever truly in danger? No.<br>Aaron: Yeah, I see it. Why is life so difficult? Well, because that's what's needed for us to grow quickly. You know, if life was real easy and it never challenged us, well, then our growth would be pretty small. But by undergoing all these challenges of this earthly existence, we're able to speed up our growth, our spiritual growth so much that we ourselves deemed it worthwhile. Yes, it's kind of like ripping off a Band-Aid. You know, you just kind of get it over with quick, and that's kind of what coming to Earth is like. It's difficult. I'm not one to minimize anybody's pain and suffering because I know it can be very difficult, but the corresponding growth that we get from that difficulty, which we don't even realize, is significant. And so significant that we ourselves thought it was worthwhile.<br>And I think that's the reason why Earth is so difficult is because we can get our training, our education, the experiences that we need to become the kind of souls we're supposed to be. We can get it very quickly and then move on to the happier, more joyful existence that awaits us all. We can just move through this faster and get to the good stuff. And so that's why I view Earth as being as difficult as it is.<br>Christian: Yeah, I just want to comment that I agree 100%, Aaron. And I feel like there's a very simple crude metaphor on Earth might be like why would you lay down on a weight bench and lift 200 lbs? Why would you do that? Well, you know, because you get stronger faster. Like it's not that the 200 pounds is even native to you, but it provides one heck of an opportunity if you can push it up. It might crush your chest for a bit till you push it up, but like it's an opportunity. It's not like, "Oh, we're doomed to this ultimate suffering here we are." <br>No, no, it's just we agree, we chose, we chose this, man, like to come here because like I remember being so excited by the contrast. And I knew I was biting off a piece of sandwich that was so freaking big that it would probably break me at the personality level. I knew that I was like, "Oh my gosh, let's do it, man. Let's do it. I know I can do it. It's bigger than I've ever like you know, like a bigger piece of sandwich." This is a terrible metaphor, but it's the only thing I can think of. Like you know, the bite of contrast was I knew it would be so challenging that it might crush me, but I knew that that meant a huge potential not only for my own growth but for the whole. I was serving the whole by biting off a big piece of sandwich. So anyway, yeah, I love the way you described that, sir.<br>Rebecca: Yeah, that's beautiful. The visual I'm getting is like a rubber band, and how deep and that you pull back is going to launch you farther, right? So how far do you want to pull that kind of thing? So part of my pre-birth experience, I remembered kind of like a two-part thing about choosing this life. One, I wanted to be here to help the planet, kind of raise vibration, you know, that whole experience of helping. So I do remember volunteering, and then I do remember going into the planning room where I met with my family soul group, right? And each of them had a specific way they wanted their lives to go and to happen and to change and everything, but somebody had to really take the brunt of it, which translated to me as a traumatic, abusive childhood.<br>And I do remember agreeing to that so that I could help all these beautiful souls with their goals, and I remember just feeling that love so much for them that I was so willing to do that. And trust me when I say there's so many times where I'm in right here who I am now that I'm like, "What was I thinking? Oh my gosh, you know, what did I sign up for? That was a lot harder than I expected," you know, that sort of thing. And but still, that love, that deep remembrance, I think this pre-birth memory came to me, came back to me in knowing because it helped me with healing the abuse and understanding why I had to have such a traumatic childhood.<br>And you know, there's so many close calls where I almost didn't make it, you know, and staying here, and I was like, "Why would that be designed to be that close, you know, where I would maybe make certain decisions that would end my life here?" You know, it's like it really took it close, but when I see this family generational line, it's like I can see the beauty in the opportunity that it has presented so many souls. And then just also being here and being of service and helping other souls through their traumatic childhoods, right? We mentioned previously giving that blueprint of how to get through it, right? Here's a really steep mountain trail. Nobody's decided to climb it yet. You know, "Oh, I'll do it," like what, you know, don't turn left here like I did, you know, that sort of thing.<br>The word trailblazer comes to mind. I think there's some of us as souls that we are literal trailblazers when it comes to coming down here and being like, "We just want to take off, you know, and maybe it's we've had some soul experience behind us or I don't even know it all. I know is that there's this desire to help and to love, right, and to heal. And by heal, I mean just remembering oneness and love because that's really what it is. Healing is really just peeling off those layers, right, in remembering our oneness.<br>So yeah, I just want to kind of also let the audience know too, it's like you know, we've some of us have dealt with some really heavy stuff, and you know, where we came from Orthodox beliefs, religion, that kind of thing. We made a moral transition right, and we planned that kind of diversity, you know, that challenge so that it would launch us into being able to be of service. And that at the end of the day is my reminder.<br>I currently deal with depression on a daily basis. I am treated for depression, and I have mental illness on both sides of my father's side, my mother's side, and that is something that I deal with. And it's like, "How do I keep going, you know, and how do I, what is my purpose for being here?" And this is my remembrance. This is my purpose because there's others like those out there that struggle like this, and they have chosen what they feel like such dark themes in their life or struggles or such heavy, heavy issues and themes. And how can you be spiritual, you know? It almost feels like too much of a contrast, right? Somebody's got to be there to show that, "Hey, I took this little step one by one, and this is how I was able to get through it." We need more examples of that because that's what keeps us going and connected.<br><br><br>Ary: I don't really like the word suffering. Suffering comes from an attachment to the pain. So when you have pain and you attach to that, you always bring it up as suffering. "I've suffered there, I've suffered there, I've gone through this and this," because you are attached to that pain. You made it a part of your identity. There is a lesson in everything, and I think and I feel like nature has given us the clue to our physical bodies. When you get a wound, when you cut yourself, your body heals on its own, but you also have to play a role by getting it clean, taking care of yourself to speed it up. But everything on Earth, everything here is here to nurture you, help you heal, and help you grow.<br>And when you don't focus on why it happened but how can you heal yourself, how can you get something out of this experience, and how can you move on, then the answers will come to you, and you will then see the impact of that healing on other people. The healed person of you, the one that has gained the insight from that suffering, from that pain and experience, will be able to help other people. And everybody, you'll be able to provide a safe environment for others to you, and you'll be able to share what helped you as well.<br>So in short, I would say yes, you will have to go through some things that are in your contract or some things that have been passed on by your parents, by your grandparents, some traumas that have been passed on to you. You are responsible, but you can't blame them. But you are now responsible for working on them, for getting through them, and expanding yourself. I can tell you for sure that the other side of the suffering is so beautiful, and it's so worth it, and it's worth going for. So whatever you suffer, you attach to the pain. Don't just question why it has to be you, but understand that it has to be you because you can go through it. You are able to look and flip to the other beautiful side of it and share that side with everybody. So someone has to go through that, and if you've been chosen, I would say just shift how you see things and see it as a chance for you to expand more.<br>And it's all about on this planet, especially on Earth, it's all about managing your energy. Whatever you want to focus on, the wording you choose, how you want to do things, how you want to perceive things. Sometimes you've suffered through something, but your memories can't change it. It's in the past. You are in the present moment that no longer exists. So everything is actually can be neutral. It's whatever you attach to that experience, into that memory. You can always flip the coin by saying, "Yes, I had this accident where I suffered and I lost this and this, but you can also say, "I have experienced this, and that has changed my life and made me who I am today, and these are the things I've learned." You can always change your wording and how you see things, and you will not see it as suffering but just an experience and part of your journey.<br>Why do we have to suffer? You can choose to accept life as it is. Life has hardships that they serve, and they are balanced by the other side of it by learning to just take whole life as life is life. It's very divided into suffering, and it has this, and it has a contrast. That contrast actually needs a balance. So that is it for me.<br>Thank you so much to each of you for sharing. I will admit that this is a question I tend not to speak to too much simply because there are people in the world who have suffered so much more deeply than I have. I know a couple of you here have experienced, you shared with me your interviews, trauma beyond what I had experienced in my childhood, and people around the world are suffering horrific things that I personally couldn't imagine. And I think that the appropriate response to somebody who is suffering is not to try to answer the question of why but simply to be present and hold space for their experience.<br>But for those who are genuinely asking this question because they're interested in higher answers, from a human perspective, perhaps there is no good answer, but from a higher perspective, in my experience and the experience of those that I've spoken to, my best attempt to answer this question would be to say that because Earth is specifically designed to experience really deep contrast, and it plays a specific role of allowing us to advance our spiritual evolution in a fast-forward manner, like you mentioned, Aaron, and to deep like higher highs, we're trying to reach the higher highs here, that's why we experience some of the deepest lows here. And that those people who do choose to take on those experiences for the benefit of the rest of us are incredibly brave souls, and I give them my gratitude.<br>Thank you, Melissa. There was also one other thing I wanted to share. The power that I have learned with my own mind in my own recovery has just blown me away, and managing chronic pain and all of these things that have come up, I have learned so much about neuroplasticity because we can shape and mold our brain. We can constantly keep it growing and learning new things. You know, there's so many things that we're getting into with regard to trauma and recovery that we're just tapping into now, and it's really exciting. And to be able to grow and learn and to be able to test it out, you know, it's it feels very like a guinea pig, but it's also such an exciting period because you can really see, feel like what works for you.<br>So I feel like it's a kind of like almost a never-ending theme in terms of being able to try different things in terms of like with trauma recovery, and I'm very open to the different things that you know come out. Some of them not so great, some of them may work, you know, and it's all part of that healing journey and sharing that with others. But I just wanted to give others hope that there is so much you can do with your own mind, including just education and learning about your energetic body and you know just all of that. There's just put it to use, and you will take charge of your, I guess you would say, suffering, and it won't feel like suffering anymore. It'll feel like another opportunity to be able to work through like pain management, for instance, yeah, and using like the different tricks and tips and things like that that you can learn with changing your neuropathways. It's pretty cool stuff.<br><br><br>So great comment. All right, have you in your own personal journey discovered a way to feel that overwhelming love, peace, and bliss that you felt in your pre-birth experience? Is there a way that we can bring that through into this world?<br>Rebecca: So I'm just going to be very transparent here. There's so many different ways. I tried ketamine infusions, which did nothing for my depression unfortunately, but the trips themselves brought me to that oneness. Like if you've done cacao ceremony circles or you know, it's just like having like your little mug of chocolate, you know, that's been very like a milder form.<br>So definitely, there's ways where they actually made me feel absolutely horrible at first but then brought me into like an amazing experience of feeling that oneness. But I don't necessarily have to do that again. I'm able to do that through meditation, you know, and music 100%. Music for me is I could just hit, and I know if I had a piano here, I'd do it. I go straight to my chord, and this chord that I play, it feels like my home resonance. I don't know how to describe it other than like this sounds like the frequency that I am used to hearing whenever I get goosebumps when I listen to certain music or changes, and like that is just immediately feeling like I am there with source and creation.<br>A lot of my dream-like scenarios are also you know that we've that I'm sure a lot of us have had where we either meet with an angel or a guide or even just flying dreams. Those are also like just that much more closer feeling like beyond or human like what seems like our limitations or whatnot. So these are all you know kinds of ways of doing it, but yeah, absolutely like music and binaural beats and meditation, you know, and maybe I guess that monkey mind that we all have, right, kind of put that aside, and then we can be more open to you know these esoteric experiences. Those are some ways that I've kind of explored it, and it's fun. It really is. And sometimes it's just a walk in nature. You don't really need to be extreme, you know.<br>Aaron: Well, I'll share. You know, there was a couple portions of my experience where it was really amazing, you know, very, very happy. I couldn't describe it. And for me, I don't know of any way to bring that kind of joy and happiness into this level of existence. So I don't really have any good answer for how to do that, only that I wish I could because you know parts of my experience were just amazing, and I look forward to getting back to that when it's my time.<br>Christian: Yeah, so I feel the question is a bit tricky because as humans, we focus on form, things, objects, actions, substances. You know, tell me the way, tell me the action I can take, you know, I'll go do that thing. The bliss of being is what we actually already are. So like Rebecca when she described music or nature or even flying in a dream, as we resonate back closer to the full freedom of our nature or we resonate with an expression of creative like some creative expression, whether it be music or a sunset or the living presence of nature, that resonance vibrationally moves us closer to who we are, maybe a small amount, maybe a large amount, because we are now like returning vibrationally through that perception and that perspective back to like what can be thought of perhaps as a more mechanical process.<br>But when we actually let go of the forms of the mind and dwell fully in beingness itself, it rises up all on its own back to us. That bliss is what we already are. It never actually left. It never actually went anywhere. So but then we want to say, "Well, how do I do that?" Well, again, that's like it's quite a trick of a question because that implies that some form is going to get you there. And the thing is, spirit itself transcends all form. We may change the form constraints like when we take drugs or have some kind of physical alteration of the biochemical constraint set that we're wearing. That can change the constraints, but meanwhile, we're not the form. The form is arising in us. The experience of the body, the sensory information, the thoughts, the distance, all the things, it's all arising within consciousness.<br>And then when we lose ourselves in the things that we're not, that's the confusion. So the question is a little bit like saying, "How do we be who we really are?" Well, let go of what you're not, or choose something here that is more you, all the way free, like some expression of freedom and joy and love now here today. Like if you put it this way, if you're the real you, you will know bliss. Like if you just in whatever way, if you're the real you, just exactly who you are underneath all the crap, the real you, that is bliss. So then you say, "Well, how do we find that? How do you be you?" So how can we bring that giving of peace and bliss you felt in your pre-birth memory here now?<br>I will agree with what Christian has said in terms of it's about being present now, practically speaking, because I feel like this question was from somebody who wants a practical answer. Sometimes you tell somebody, "Be who you are, be yourself," and they just like, "What is that?" So practically speaking, being present allows you to be in that place already because that is the foundation. Peace is your foundation. Peace and love is your foundation. That's who you are. Now you've got these layers and layers of limited beliefs and those things that are from this world and from your parents and social beliefs and things that are preventing you from exploring who you truly are.<br>Now there are some practices that will allow you to experience peace and freedom and experiment with them, and those are spiritual practices that Rebecca has told us about, which is art, music, crafting, creating, poetry, writing, gardening. It is all creative practices because you are a creator. You are the creator. You are the universe. That is who you are. You love to create, and when you start creating, that's when you explore your freedom. That's when you expand, and you are fully present. You start appreciating little things about nature, every flower, bird, what they are, their true nature, and that's when you become more and more present without yourself knowing that you are doing those things to be more present. It's just those practices that allow you to strengthen your spiritual element.<br>We have five elements in nature, and the main element is the spiritual element. That's who you are. That is what activates the other elements. So through those practices, they will help you become more present. And in terms of how to be present, it's all about managing your energy and thoughts and what you give energy to. You can definitely choose your thoughts and what you want to be, who you want to be, what beliefs you want to have. But in order to do that, once again, you have to meditate. Meditation is not going to solve it instantly, but it's a long-term investment. It is something you have to keep on doing, two minutes, five minutes a day. Be still, be silent, and feel the life force energy that is running through you, and you'll be able to feel that energy in everybody.<br>I would say just know that peace is the foundation, and that is your foundation. Try to work with everything that is not allowing you to be at your peace, in your peace, and mainly meditation is something that will help you to be more present and just engaged with whatever you are doing, wherever you are, with whoever you're speaking. Be engaged.<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, thank you, Ary. That was beautiful. I want to reiterate too that meditation is like if we have to pick one activity that's a really that's like the one because we if we as we choose wield and attention as we set aside time to choose to focus well at first on something neutral just so we can control our focus but then just fully on the aliveness that's present here now. And like Ary said, it doesn't have to be super long, three even three or five minutes or 20 minutes or 40 minutes, whatever. Set aside the time, and it like by choosing to take the time and the energy and to focus it away from the form back to the aliveness, that choice of yours to spend that time and to spend that energy to turn back inward, that's powerful.<br>And as we do that like over time, we grow in an experiential knowing of what we really are, which is awareness itself versus what we're not, all the thoughts and all the forms that seem so important. It like untangles us not because we're trying to go get untangled but because we are choosing to focus better back to what we really are, that silence, that spacious awareness, that aliveness, that thriving living beingness that's always there. That's beautiful.<br>And then the other thing I was going to just mention real quick is intuition. So you know, I try not to give too specific of answers because people are so unique, but guess what? Everybody has that knowing. Like everybody's intuition is whispering to them who they really are. So I thank you, Ary, for commenting that practically speaking, I yeah, I recognize this. It's difficult because typically when someone's asking, it's helpful if they have something practical. So it's difficult to comment there, but meanwhile, just I'm just pointing towards listen to your intuition. Like listen to the deeper you. Maybe the deeper you is going to say go take a nap. That's okay. And then the ego will say, "No, I have things I have to function. I have to perform." It's okay if you need to sleep. Go sleep. Like whatever it is, I'm just saying like the intuitive part of you knows. Like the big you is really wise. It has a really good vantage point.<br>So when we're trying to figure out how to get back to the bliss of being, the big you kind of knows, and if you're willing and humble enough because you got to be like I mean because you know you got to be willing to see your own stuff, but if you're willing to actually listen, intuition will always guide us in that direction when we're willing to actually listen.<br>Thank you so much again. I just love how each of you are sharing a unique perspective that's just kind of building on what the other is saying, and I just love that for myself because I was born with a pre-birth memory. My entire life was about how do I experience this bliss again, and I spent a lot of years trying to seek that experience and trying to figure it out. I did some crazy things, and I never even got close until in my adulthood, in my late 20s, early 30s, I began to understand that I was looking in the wrong place. I was looking outside of me, trying to stimulate something by going to a church service or out in nature, out in some crazy way, whether like if I get myself in the right place at the right time, something's going to happen.<br>I finally began to understand that, as Christian said, what I'm looking for is what I already am, and I have to look within. And to echo what Ary said though, a lot of people like, "What does that mean practically?" And that's what I also didn't understand for quite a while. And the way that I explain it now is to say that you have to look in the right place and the right time. The right place and the right time is look here, look now, and look within you. And once you can really grasp that and come fully into the present moment right here and experience your own being, that's where you begin to access this bliss.<br>Practically speaking, things that have worked for me because for me it has been I've needed practices to help me identify like where am I looking, how do I access this, what does it feel like. One of the biggest things for me has been gratitude because it connects me with my true nature. It connects me with that part of me that is seeing God everywhere in everything. Another thing for me has been putting myself in situations where I'm forced to let go of control and just becoming very present. For instance, riding on a roller coaster or going down a scary water slide with my kids forces me into that present moment experience. Then I can identify and say, "Okay, this is the feeling I'm looking for."<br>Another thing for me is walking barefoot on the earth and meditating because the energy of the earth amplifies my own energy and connects me to myself. And another less pleasant thing that helps me is when I'm in really stressful situations in life to intentionally in those situations set out time to meditate and practice surrender. And when I'm under stress, if I can use that letting go muscle and experience what does that feel like to just let go of things I can't control and be at peace now, I found that probably to be the most amplifying practice for me.<br>Now I haven't ever experienced bliss to the level that I did in my out-of-body experiences here, but little by little, I can start to access these timeless states of being and bring that through a little bit.<br>Christian: Thank you, Melissa, for saying that. I feel like if there's a moment when that bliss might arise, it's like one drop, but the one drop is so wonderful because it's like we're in a desert right now. The one drop is like, "Oh my gosh, I remember that," and we're looking for the ocean. We're looking for the full thing, but even the one drop is so full. So anyway, I thank you for making that comment.<br>And also the surrendering of the resistance comment, I think that's really powerful because we all have stress. Like we all experience stressful moments. Being fully present in your body even like when you're having those stressful moments, just take time. Like I had a very stressful work meeting this week where I had 11 minutes for lunch in the middle of a six-hour meeting where I was being yelled at for like hours. It's okay. So I stepped out, I sat on this bench, and I just felt this incredible density in my body of like, "Oh wow, I feel that," and just totally allowing it, letting go, totally surrendering to the density, releasing any like, "I don't have power. It's fine. I don't need power over this. I just feel it." You know, that and then when you do that, I'm reminded of an Eckhart Tolle quote. I don't remember the exact quote, but it's something like if you surrender into the present moment for like even the duration of one breath, the movement in consciousness because linear time is transcendent anyway, so even if you just totally let go for the duration of one breath and are fully present, it's okay that it's only the short linear time duration because you're tapping into something that amount of time.<br>I think that we're doing fine on time. Do you guys want to go ahead with a bonus question?<br>Melissa: Sure.<br><br><br>All right, bonus question: What is the most significant moment of your pre-birth experience, something that has stuck with you throughout your life?<br>Aaron: I'm glad we got to this because I had something to share about this. You know, something that really stands out for my experience was kind of two things that are linked together. One is that at one point during my experience, I got to witness some souls that were in a state of extreme misery. You know, they were very unhappy. I think we would kind of call it a hellish existence. And you know, I saw that for myself, and so have many other experiencers. And I think that you can't just ignore that because it's kind of inconvenient or uncomfortable that there are souls that are very unhappy.<br>But the takeaway I want to share about that is that I witnessed souls leave that form of existence. Like nobody was trapped there forever. I was even told that all of these souls, every one of them, would eventually leave and move to something higher. And that kind of rolls into the second big takeaway I had, which was you know, there's a bit of a commonly accepted narrative that I think is imperfect where souls either go to heaven or they go to hell. But what I witnessed and a lot of other people have talked about is that that's not quite right. Really, it's a huge range of what I would call different levels that souls go to, and that every soul is progressing ever upward to a higher, happier level.<br>And that includes these unfortunate souls that were in a difficult place, but it also includes everyone else that you know, whatever level they're at after this life, none of nobody is stuck there. And that just because you're in a happy place doesn't mean everybody's at the same level of happiness. And if we could shift the viewpoint from black or white, one way or the other way, into more of a graduated or a bunch of different levels, I think we'd have a better understanding of how this is really working. And then the other big thing is hey, nobody's stuck. Nobody is trapped forever after this one life or after a life at whatever level they're at. But they'll be given opportunities to continue their upward progression and improve their happiness and their wisdom and raise themselves to higher levels of existence. So that was my takeaway I wanted to share.<br><br><br>Melissa: Thank you so much for sharing that, Aaron. I love that unique aspect of your experience where you saw several different realms and got to see people progress out of them.<br>I guess I will go ahead and share that the thing that's stuck with me most from my pre-birth memory, aside from the bliss of course, it's just the very simple and maybe obvious fact that love is the answer to everything. I remember as a young child just really struggling with understanding not only the violence and the pain that we can inflict on each other here but also something that I couldn't put language to until much later, which is just the lack of awareness that we have here compared to over there. And that's just part of the experience here because we're limited beings, but I just always had like this deeper understanding or remembrance that love is the answer.<br>Now as I've gone about my life, I mean on the other side, it seems so simple, but as I've gone about my life, it's definitely more complicated, a lot more complicated than I thought it was going to be to love in the density that we find ourselves here. It's so difficult because you can do your best and have your best intentions, but because we are limited beings, we are still unintentionally hurting people. I can be doing my absolute best effort, and I forget to call my grandpa on his birthday, or you know, I forget something that my husband asked me to do, or you know, it could be anything like it's impossible to get it exactly perfect.<br>So what does it mean to love? What does it mean that love is the answer? I think that it also means extending love to ourselves, extending love to our own imperfections and limitations and accepting it all as okay, accepting it all as it is. And that's I think that's something that we tend here not to understand or to forget is that love means immersing yourself in the experience and accepting the experience and holding space for the experience, and that's what will ultimately allow us to progress.<br>Self-compassion was a big missing component and part of my healing journey that when I was working with my pain coach and colleague this year, I realized it was a big puzzle piece. And especially as if the cultural thing as women and self-compassion and towards our bodies and you know all of that and you know expectations and all of that, it was just a skill that I don't think I was ever taught you know growing up and everything and especially within religion. You're kind of well certain religions I would say especially the one that I was raised in, it was like you saw yourself as a sinner and imperfect and unclean and all of that. And so going from that and then learning self-compassion and love for yourself, that is huge.<br>And I have no idea what that looked like, what it felt like. You know, what does that look like for me? What does it feel like for me? And it's and you know it felt so foreign too like when I started to do it you know it just felt so awkward and then you know one small step and I built upon it and built upon it and soon it was just like it started to feel a little bit like I can do this you know I can learn how to be self-compassionate with myself. <br>And it's so crazy too because it's like I have it for others no problem right for your friend or whatever you're there but for yourself when you're you feel like you're such a harsh critic or a judge on yourself and how you're doing and success and blah blah blah and you know as a parent as a mother as you know there's just so many ways you can judge yourself.<br>And so yeah it's definitely been a step that I couldn't skip I had to learn because I didn't have really anybody to teach me about it. And yeah it's just really it's almost like I wish I kind of that's where I needed to start you know it's interesting how you start with other people but that's like in here you know is where you need to start first.<br><br><br>Rebecca: I wanted to say, back to the healing and being in the flow and a lot of managing symptoms and things like that, Ary had brought up being in that creative flow. You know, it's like, "Oh, that's what I do. That's where I go." It helps alleviate those symptoms. Being present, like Christian has beautifully stated throughout this whole interview or podcast or whatever you want to call it, he really gets the root of it. It always reminds you, "Oh yes, that's where it is. It's being present and just feeling like you are already that." So beautifully said, you guys. I really appreciated that.<br>And then I wanted to also say, with the pre-birth thing, the most part, like that I remember, is just—and Melissa, you have this as part of yours too—as being that little curious orb, feeling of being that childlike innocence. You know, it's so fun that you get to feel that you have that part of yourself. Then you're fearless. You're curious, and you're fearless. That's another root part of being that I never want to forget.<br>And then, during the pre-birth experience, I got to witness the veil and what that felt like. I also got to witness spreading my energy into the energy body, right? How weird that felt and trying to get into all the nooks and crannies of my energy body until it was satisfied. Then I could go down and be into my Earth incarnation. That was such a good part to witness of the whole experience. Wow, this is what you go through before you come down, and this is how you feel as a soul, as a consciousness. I don't know. I'm just going back and forth again, but I just cannot let go of that feeling of innocent, childlike curiousness. You could do no wrong. I love that so much.<br>Ary or Christian, do you have anything you want to share?<br><br><br>Ary: Thank you for the question. My pre-birth memory was, Lord, and the main message of my pre-birth memory was for me to remember that I'm welcomed wherever I go. I'm loved by everybody, and I'm protected and supported in every way and every time and always. What it helped me with is I lost my family pretty early, so my entire life, I thought I needed a family to be whole, to feel loved, and to belong, to be a person, an individual, my blood family.<br>But I started to learn to love other people the way I would like to be loved and welcomed, accepted without judgment, with clarity. I've noticed that I am truly and incredibly blessed to be loved by everybody in my life. Even every stranger I meet, I feel like family. So instead of a family, the blood family I've lost, I've gained the giant family of the entire planet of people. I truly always question and am grateful for how much I'm loved and how much I'm supported by people on Earth.<br>So that was the message that helped me as a child to remember that, okay, maybe I'll be loved one day if I keep on loving myself. I will show love to other people. That had kept me strong, I would say.<br>Christian: And this was one of the things I learned in one of my out-of-body experiences. The whole journey, Melissa, which Melissa had said that love is the answer. You know what? It's so crazy because we are love, and everything because we come here and we experience pain and hurt and anger and those things. We experience them because we have—we are love, and we are able to experience them because it's filtered through life, Earthly sensations, and Earthly experiences.<br>The way to go back to being love is just, I mean, healing those negative, whatever you call emotions, by loving it and giving compassion. So that's the answer. Love is the beginning, and love is the end. It is actually everything. So everything in between is just happening on Earth—only the negative and everything, the pain, and the anger, and frustrations, and things like that.<br>I would say one thing that my memories and out-of-body experiences have taught me is how much we complicate life. It is actually pretty simple if you look at it with curiosity, as Rebecca said. If you are enjoying life, and by enjoying, I mean being in joy with everything that comes, and just being curious about it, it helps to see that it's actually quite simple and quite fun to be here. <br>I would say that you are loved no matter what, not only by your ancestors, spirit guides, and the source but by everybody around you. If people give you pain because they love you, it's because they chose a contract where they wanted to give you pain. To do that, to choose a contract where they give you a painful lesson, is actually a very hard choice too. It's done by someone who loves you so much. That's what I learned, and that kept me going.<br>Melissa: Thank you for the reminder Ary it's beautiful.<br>Christian: Yeah, so to your question Melissa, the most powerful moment of my pre-birth experience was after I had accepted the veil and incarnated. I was like, "I'm not doing this, this is not happening." So, I rejected the life. I tried to fight my way back out. In this lifetime, I had done that in a previous life and caused a miscarriage. I had a life review for the previous life because I had caused a miscarriage for the body that was to be mine by my rejection. I tried to do that again in this life because of the fear that rose up. I was like, "Not myself anymore. I was not the whole anymore." I was like, "It was so dense, and I was like, no, not doing this."<br>But this powerful moment happened where I was—this is so beyond language, oh my gosh—like, it's such a personal experience. I've shared it many times now because I think it's so important for people to know who we are because it's not specific to me. It's like what we are. I was expanded back out, and I was shown all the universe. I felt everything within me—all the stars, all the universe, and beyond our universe. Our universe is just like a small piece of the whole, but all the universe. <br>I felt the sun of Earth churning and alive within me, and it had so much bliss. It was just so full of raging bliss. I don't know how to describe it. I was like, "Oh my gosh, like I am that. I am still that." So, I don't need to fight anymore. God said to me that this is still what you are. You can never not be this, and it's true of all of us. I just—it moves me to tears almost every time I think of it because it's like I miss it so freaking much.<br>We're very brave to come down here and play this game. We are much more than the limitations that we've come to reject out of fear. So, that's the most powerful moment of my pre-birth experience. The thing that's in mind the most often, I would say actually, is the veil itself. Except like feeling the veil, accepting the veil. I can feel it right now, like a one-way pane of glass. You know, in those cop shows where you can see one way and you can't see the other. I'm inside the interrogation room where you can't see out, and I know they're there watching. I can see the glass, but I can't see through it. I feel that glass, that metaphorical veil, resting on me and in me right now.<br>So, that aspect of that veiling and knowing the veil but not rejecting it. Not responding like, "Oh, this is a problem that I can't see all that I am anymore." No, it's a huge offering to me, for me, for all of us. This offering of being given the opportunity to experience this. Look at where we are, guys. Like, we made it. When we first got on today, and I said, "We made it," that's what I mean. Look at this. It's magic. If we can come all the way here and share love with each other and be vulnerable and remind others.<br>Ary, I love what you said about the whole world being your family. I feel like that. It's a blessing and a curse sometimes, feeling like I love every person that walks down the street, but I do. We are all family with each other. We are, man, and so many humans have forgotten it, but that's what we are. That's our true nature. So, thank you all for coming to this moment and sharing and being brave enough to keep some of that. It is not easy to retain a little bit of that down here.<br>I don't mean down, you know, but in this place, in this vibrational density. It can be difficult to have some of that awareness because holy cow, the contrast between that bliss and here. Like you said, Melissa, it's like you spend your whole life looking for it again. I've met so many near-death experiencers who are just like, "I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go home." It's nothing wrong, you know. They just—they're like, "What am I doing here?" So, that's like the cost. That's the price to have that little bit of active awareness. You're going to go put your mail in your mailbox today and go to the bathroom and go buy laundry detergent. That's what we're going to do right now, and that's what we're doing.<br>But see, that's holy too because now we get to do that anyway. I so thank you guys very much. I feel rejuvenated. I had a heck of a week myself. It was like probably the most stressful work week I've had in years, and it's so good to be reminded of who we are, to be there for each other. Thank you.<br>Melissa: Yes, thank each of you for being a part of this. This is literally like I said, this is my favorite thing that I do, doing these fireside chats and getting a bunch of us together and just sharing. And this has been so encouraging and uplifting for me as well. Is there anything else that anyone wants to share before I give everyone a chance to share where the viewers can find you?<br>Ary: I just want to say thank you for organizing this really so it's so

 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=zkWvifTcCAI<br>3 MAY 2024 <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@GeorgeKaoCommunity" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@GeorgeKaoCommunity" target="_blank">George Kao Business</a> <br><br><br>All right, I'm really excited to be here with Christian Sundberg. It's funny, I'm a little star-struck to be honest, Christian, because I met you through watching a compilation video of stories about near-death experiences. Then I think I watched another one of your interviews or something, and then I saw that you've been interviewed a bunch on different spiritual channels. This channel, my channel, isn't mainly spiritual—I mean, that's not mainly what I talk about—but there are a lot of spiritual people that tend to be the people I draw. So I think a lot of folks will be glad to find you, and I think they'll find this conversation quite interesting because it's going to be different than most of the interviews you've done.<br>I want to give you a chance to introduce yourself and any part of it that you want to. I will, of course, link below this video to your other interviews so that people can hear your story in full. I think it's really interesting and the spiritual insights that came from that. Now, just to be clear, you didn't have a near-death experience per se, right? Not to my knowledge, right?<br>Christian: Right, right.<br><br><br>Host: You had spiritual experiences as a kid that obviously created a lot of opening of your heart and soul and insights, and you briefly kind of forgot about it for a couple of years. Then you kind of had this awakening later in your adulthood where you remembered those early experiences. Am I right to say that you then explored out-of-body experiences? Is that right?<br>Christian: Yes, not intentionally. So your comment about my experiences as a young child—it wasn't so much that I had spiritual experiences as a child per se. It's that as a very young child, I still had recollection of the pre-incarnation state. So for me, it was normal. It was the normal thing. Like, this was the strange thing, yes, right now. But that left me, though, being here. But that left me—the veil works; it does this job, right? So the more I became form-focused, you know, focused into the identity, eventually by the age of five or six, that memory left me completely. But then at the age of 30, after taking a long-term meditation practice, I began to have out-of-body experiences. And the pre-birth memory—that's kind of what I'm known for sharing, although I don't think it's the most important thing to talk about. But that awareness of what I am and what we are before, you know, preceding the human experience—that was just there. It was seen; it was known, yes.<br>And so now, my body is 44 years old, and now it's just kind of normal. I can feel the veil resting on and within my consciousness, yes. So I'm passionate about sharing that. I'm passionate about reminding everybody else that's interested that we really are multi-dimensional beings of love. Love and joy is our true nature, yes. And this human experience is just like a big play or video game simulation, you could say, yes, that we're here experiencing. And it really is like that. I mean, it's not just like a woo-woo thing or religious thing. It's like, no, we really do transcend the physical, but we take this very deep dive into this experience, yes, for specific purposes.<br><br><br>Host: It's interesting that you had these out-of-body experiences because I have been fascinated by that for a long time throughout my life. I've been touching into that every now and then. You know, the Monroe Institute is well-known—for those of you who haven't heard about it, you can Google it and find out more info. I tried doing some intentional out-of-body experiences, just like before falling asleep, trying to do all that stuff—body asleep, mind awake, yeah. <br>I feel like a couple of times I had this vibrational buzz or whatever, like, you know, people I've heard about—oh, that's the edge of getting out of your body or whatever. But the experience has never panned out because it always was really dark—not dark in terms of theme, but dark in terms of visually. Like, I couldn't see anything. And it's also the same thing with—I feel like I've probably had a lot of out-of-body experiences at night, like, just not realizing we're having them. And I feel like I have two types of dreams. One is, you know, a lot of us have such vivid dreams that we're like, "Wait, that wasn't real." And they're often like experiences that are—it's not like literally, "Oh, I was in my neighborhood and I saw it." It was like really bizarre stuff, right? <br>So I'm like, "Okay, maybe just my mind making stuff up." And then I've had some dreams where I feel like I'm walking in my house, but everything's really dark, like, well, the lights are off, okay, obviously at night. And so I feel like—and same thing with my intentional out-of-body—it was like the little I got to, I felt like it was just all really—I couldn't see anything. And it reminds me of the condition that some people have. There's a spec recently—it's been in the news—how some people have the ability to see pictures in their minds very clearly, right? And then others have a very difficult time seeing pictures in their minds. I'm one of those people who have difficulty. I've always had difficulty. People say, "Close your eyes and imagine you're on a beach." I'm like, it's a little hard for me to do that. And so I wonder if there's a connection between that and out-of-body lack of ability to do out-of-body.<br><br><br>And the other thing, Christian, I have to say is that I feel like all my life I've been so open to spiritual things and believing in lots of things, and I have never—I still can say this to this day—I have never had a spiritual experience. I've done spiritual practice, I've done prayer, I deeply have deep faith actually, and this is why we're talking because I really believe, perhaps as you do as well—I mean, you probably have even more memories than me—but I really believe it. I really believe that this is a simulation, but I've never had any paranormal experience before. Like, the veil is so thick in my life. But anyway, I just wonder if you had anything you wanted to say about that.<br>Christian: Oh, yeah, there were a lot of things that were interesting there that you commented on. I mean, we all have a unique limitation set that we wear while here, yeah. So to put it in very crude, overly crude terms, the veil is thicker or thinner for different individuals, yes, depending on many things—depending on certain spiritual elements, so soul elements, but also depending on the biology, yes. The energy of all sorts of things—the family, the country, the race. I mean, you think, yes, we have to be human or something, and then even the human race is like—every aspect of the human condition has some level of limitation that's definition. It's just definition that goes with it. And so biology is a huge part of that. And so just our biological state can very much change the level to which we experience veiling, interesting. So it's like we all have that now.<br>Like your comment about being able to picture something in your mind—I'm not in that camp that I can't picture something in my mind. I have a very vivid imagination visually, great. But when I was writing the book, my editor was actually commenting, "You know, a lot of people experience this; you should kind of comment on that in part four of the book when I speak to meditation." So I thought that was very interesting, and I did briefly comment on some other focuses. If you can't focus something in your mind, you know, some image, then what else can you pick to focus on? That's right. So that's not my personal experience, but I understand that that happens.<br><br><br>Regarding dreams versus other experiences, I feel there's a very distinct difference. There's dreams, there's lucid dreams, and then there's out-of-body experiences, right? And the lucid dream—I find that lucid dreaming and out-of-body experiences can shift between them with some ease. Anyway, the darkness you experience may be a part of veiling, you know, because you're starting to look in the direction of non-physical information, but if you're really focused into the form, it might arrive very dim until you're really focused into it.<br>When you made that comment about vibrations—hearing vibrations—okay, so like the first non-physical experience I had during my awakening at the age of 30 was purely a vibration experience, but it was not subtle. It was the most physical, violent, loud, extreme vigor. It sounded like someone had parked a jet engine on either side of my head. That's how loud it was. It was not a joke. It was like the most real—you know, it was so tangible. And I actually jumped out of bed because my body was asleep when I experienced this moment. I was wide awake—my consciousness was wide awake—even though my body was asleep, and I was experiencing this vibration through my body. And when my body did wake up after that, I actually leapt out of bed. I was sweating; I was freaked out. I was like, "What the hell was that?" you know, because it was so not subtle.<br><br><br>So I'm just saying that there are degrees to which we might tap into it. I would always encourage—don't be discouraged, okay? Because you know, you made a comment like, "I haven't had a spiritual experience." No, I mean, right now you're having one, yeah. And I want to clarify—so yeah, I want to clarify. I like I said, I don't believe I've ever had a paranormal experience. I mean, I've hired—I've had sessions with psychics. I've done an in-between lives session with—oh my gosh, what's his name? The guy who wrote "Your Soul's Plan." Oh my gosh, Robert Schwartz. Robert Schwartz, no—Robert Schwartz, yeah, it probably is, yeah, think so. "Your Soul's Plan." He speaks so eloquently to sort of in-between lives and our soul planning and all that stuff. He, on—recently I heard his old interview on Buddha at the Gas Pump, but I had one of the multi-hour between-lives experiences, and I still—yeah, don't—I still feel like it was interesting, but it could have been made up in my mind. I feel like my karma or my destiny—I mean, just apparently is what I can tell—is to not ever, perhaps until now, have a paranormal experience and yet to practice the faith of it all.<br>Christian: Well, you have such a presence of awareness that I'm not surprised that—wow, because okay, so just one comment—like, okay, it's just like I hear from people sometimes I say, "Well, I've been meditating for 20 years, and I never experienced anything." Okay, so the thing is, it's like this is just a metaphor, but imagine you're walking along the edge of a cliff up on a plateau, and it's foggy. You could be one inch away from the edge, and you don't know it. And so it's like that when it comes to how close we are to the non-physical. We tend to think, "Oh, I'm a million miles away. I've been walking on this cliff for 20 years or 50 years or 100 years. I never experienced anything. I'm me; it's just this is endless." <br>No, no, no. Just because you can't see it doesn't mean you're not right next to it. And so I just think that's important to lift up because I have personally found that, like, meditation—it all of a sudden, you'll fall off the cliff. It's not like you—I mean, I personally don't have—I mean, there's only been one time in my life I've been able to go out of body and meet someone on purpose, only one time. Other than that, all the non-physical experiences have just arisen on their own, and it's like I just walked off a cliff that was always there.<br>You know, like, basically, we were always in the movie theater watching the movie. So you don't have to go anywhere. If you're in a movie theater watching a movie screen, the shift—you don't have to escape the movie. And I think what happens is when we believe so deeply in the movie, now we think, "I have to go somewhere. I have to create some new experience," right? No, it's a shift in awareness back towards the person sitting in the seat. And then when you do that—which is actually looking away from the sense data, away from the thoughts—and then once you do that sufficiently, all of a sudden you just go, "Oh, I'm in the seat. Oh, I never was in the movie. Oh my gosh, that's amazing," you know? That's right.<br>Host: Yeah, this is brilliant, actually. I like both of those analogies a lot. And this is maybe a good transition point to the main thing I wanted to talk to you about today, which is the reality—with a capital R versus small R. Well, the movie metaphor is perfect, or the video game metaphor as well. Like, this is something that I have believed for a long time, and those who watch my videos have probably heard me talk about how—you know, and it's like I sounded more crazy years ago, and as years have gone on, it sounded less and less crazy, which is—I truly believe we are—I mean, ever since I was—well, when I was young, I played this video game called Ultima, the Ultima series, which was about a hero, an avatar who came from Earth through the portal, right? It's this idea of a matrix. This guy, you know, goes from like normal life, just like a middle-class guy, and then goes into a portal into Britannia, this—you know, plays with dragons and orcs and all that stuff. <br>And he—but it wasn't just about battling yourself through the dungeon, but as the series evolved from Ultima 1, 2, 3, and then suddenly 4 introduced virtues—or no, I think 1, 2, 3 already had virtues before—introduced, okay, now you're going to work on your virtues. I'm like, as a kid, I'm like, "Whoa." And they had like—yeah, and it's like, "Oh no, you're going to go on these quests, and every choice you make either increases your compassion or your courage or decreases them or decreases your honesty." And all these dialogues, you make a choice. This is back in the late '80s, '90s, you know, early '90s. It was like really revolutionary to me, and I'm like, "Wait, isn't life like that?" And the thing about the game is that you could never see your virtue scores. You could see your health score, like if you're going to die or not physically, you could see, right? Just like in regular life, you can see you're going to die, but you can't see your virtue score. <br>You have to kind of intuit into that and just know that every choice you're making is either increasing it or decreasing it. And some choices are neutral, of course, but my God, ever—and then in the late '90s, 1999, "The Matrix" movie—I saw it like at least twice in the theater because it blew me away. I'm like, "That makes so much sense." Like, yes, like it was so profoundly powerful that we are so plugged in, we don't even realize we're plugged in. Yes, and then there are Neo figures, well, you're here, you are coming along and saying, "Listen, you're in the matrix. Let me show you a way that you can—" So I am really—first, I want to allow you to speak to how your experiences and remembrance speak to this idea, the matrix idea, and like what we're here maybe to grow some virtues or something like that.<br>Christian: Yeah, yeah, no, those are both really apt metaphors. I will just disclaim very quickly that these are just metaphors, of course. Our language cannot speak to this, so you know, we're going to try, but I just have to highlight that because, you know, the form-focused mind is like, "Oh, tell me what object it's like. Tell me what symbol it's like." Okay, now it's that we transcend all of the physical universe in all of its context. We transcend linear time, discrete location, all this stuff. <br>So it's far bigger than we can articulate successfully. But I will say that in my pre-life planning—to your first metaphor of Ultima 4—okay, so like, I remember reviewing what I can only describe as like virtues. Okay, so it was like—whoa, it was more like—what am I? It's like the best way to describe it—like, it was like this is just a metaphor, but it was like if you put graphs up on a wall, and there were hundreds of like energetic points. Wow, I could see the one that was so obviously the thing that I needed to work on. Okay, now it's not "need to work"—I mean, I have to take the words tough because it's not like we have to do anything. Nothing is required of us. And I don't like the words "work on" either because that makes it sound like a task. <br>Okay, it's neither of those things, but it was an opportunity. It's not an imperfection or a weakness. Yeah, yeah, it's not an imperfection, and it's not like, "Oh, you got to go do this, man. Get down there," you know? It's not like that. But I could see very obviously, "Oh man, like I—I mean, I knew I had certain—I'm careful to use the word qualities or virtues, but I just say areas of experience that I understood that I had evolved like that. I had been that. <br>I understood at a being level I really was the—you know, I engendered maybe or something. I don't know, represented—I don't know, but there was this one that was like this fear that had bested me before, and it was so deep and it was so profoundly challenging for me before, and I was like, "Oh man, I didn't have to look very far." It was like it was almost like a joke. It was like you look at this big—oh, I'm just making this up, but like a thousand lines on this graph, but the one is like way down there. It's really easy to identify. Like, that was how it was for me. It was okay, that's obviously the most optimal thing I could do to balance myself out would be to really process that. So that is kind of like an Ultima thing.<br>Host: Yeah, well, it makes me think of like—let's say an athlete is good at multiple sports, right? And then they're like, "Oh, I'm really good at swimming. I'm really good at cycling. I'm really good at running." Or maybe they're not good at running, and they're like, "I'm really curious to know what would happen if I could increase that because I could see some of my athlete buddies are really good runners, and maybe they're not as good swimmers, but whatever." Like, is it something like that? It's you don't have to—so it's pulling at you, right? <br>Like, you want to—yeah, pulling at you is not a terrible way to put it. It's more like you have your own interest—not even desire; I don't want to use the word desire either. You have your own interest in balancing out, you know, because the more that we integrate, the more we balance out, the more capacity we have for the knowing of all the joys and all the love and all the expression. Like, we want to know more of it. We want to feel; we want to be more expanded because we choose to, not because we have to. <br>And so when there's some area that has been a challenge for us, we come to walk on the weak leg of that area. That's a metaphor I've often mentioned with my wife. Like, I have certain areas I may be strong, but I have one area that's okay—it's a weak leg for me. And it might not be hard for anybody else, and that's fine. It's a personal challenge area, and that's okay. <br>And I think sometimes we see that in other people, like maybe close friends or family. It's easy to see, yeah, maybe like maybe we have a friend who really struggles with—I don't know—self-confidence or something or shame or whatever, and maybe that's an area that for us, like, okay, we don't really have an issue with that, but maybe for them, it's man, it's hard. That's okay. Like, we all have that thing, you know, those areas that we're dealing with. <br>So experientially, we grow through the integration of those experiences. And so this is like the matrix in that what it does is it gives us a very super consistent, persistent, dense, in-your-face context through which—guess what?—you actually have to make choices here, like real choices. And the choices feel like it's high stakes, and yes, because obviously, if it was—well, that's that's how we—that's the name of the game. That's how you tell a good story, right? Like, director, writers, story—exactly. <br>Well, you know, the character has to go through this arc, and at certain points, there has to feel like a high-stake conflict, like they could die or they could lose this relationship or something bad could happen that they would have trouble recovering from or never recover from. Like, the higher the stake, the more exciting the story is, yeah. So it definitely is like that.<br><br><br>And what comes to mind for me is just a personal short personal story about three or four weeks ago—guess it was three and a half weeks ago now—I was in a car accident. I was hit from behind, and my car was totaled. Oh my God, very violent, very sudden. Wow, you know, I was not aware that it was going to happen. I was stopped when it happened. So I went to the ER that morning because I couldn't focus my eyes properly, and I had a headache. So I'm in the ER getting checked out, and I'm kind of like, "Oh wow, like I just experienced a very violent thing." <br>So the thing is, the ego is very quick to do something with it—justify it away, tell a story about it. No, but I want to allow all that has arisen or arises. I want to just—I want to actually know it because that's how we really grow through it. So I always just hit—you know, okay, I—and I have swelling behind my left eye, okay, you know, and I have—like, how do you respond to that now? <br>And the reason I'm mentioning it is that feels like high stakes. I'm telling you, you walk out of a car accident, your nervous system is kind of shocked, you know? And I think I had a mild concussion, so I'm dazed. My brain is not working properly. So that feels very high stakes. So because it's like I feel threatened, you know? The body feels threatened, and then the car is destroyed, so that has implications, you know? So then, but that feels high stakes. <br>So but then the question is, what do we do with that? Because even though it's very intense, high intensity, there's no question to me that that experience, at least for me, was a high-intensity experience. It's actually neutral. Actually, everything that arises—it may be less or more intensity, less or more sensation, less or more meaning, like contextual meaning, an implication upon us. <br>But whatever arises, we always have the choice how we respond to it and what choice we make. Now, you see, that's all it's about because what we are is consciousness. We're not the body; we're not the car; we're not the circumstance; we're not the money. Yeah, we're the experiencer who then has to wield an intention.<br><br><br>So I'll just say really quickly—like, back to my pre-birth experience—I remember when—so I won't go into it in depth, but because I shared it, as you said, many times—but I remember communicating with a being who had been physical many times before I had ever incarnated and feeling from him this incredible power and expansiveness and capability that I just didn't know. Like, and so I was immediately, "I want to do that." Like, I could not believe what I felt that he was capable of. <br>And what he communicated initially was something to the effect of, "That's what they all say." Like, "You just don't know." Like, it wasn't negative; it wasn't like making fun of me or anything. Like, it was just a simple, neutral comment like, "Well, you just don't—you're just ignorant to how hard this is." Like, "It's no joke," kind of thing. And I was like, "No, I want to do it." And I didn't understand experientially how rigorous the human experience can be. It can be freaking rigorous, you know? <br>We can have very extreme, painful experiences here, you know, high stakes, like you said. Yeah, oh my God, then what do you do? You know, that then has the human—now what do you do? It's one thing on the other side to say, "I'm kind," right? It's another thing when someone flicks you off on the street, and you've had a long day, and are you kind? Yeah, you see? Wow, and the high stakes make the choice deeply meaningful and transformative, right? Yes, exactly. <br>Transformative is the key. You got it. It makes it valuable because otherwise, it's like, "Yeah, no big deal. Nothing's a big deal. I choose this way or that way or whatever, yeah, sure." It's like, right, it's like if someone doesn't care what they're eating, you know, let's say your wife says, "Well, let's go out to a restaurant," and you're like, "Oh, we could do this or that. No, no, no big deal." But if you have dietary restrictions, right, right, it's higher stakes. You go higher stakes. That's this one, you know?<br>Host: It reminds me of a comment Tom Campbell made that stuck with me. I remember him saying something to the effect of—early on, okay, so this reality system is not the first veiled physical reality experience. This is—we've done this a lot many times. It continues to refine and get even more rigorous potentially. <br>But Tom Campbell talks about how early veiled experiences were very low stakes. They had no—there wasn't a huge—so he compared it metaphorically to like a big chat room on the internet. Ah, interesting, where you could say anything you wanted, and it didn't really matter. It didn't hurt anybody; it didn't hurt you. It was just a bit like—so is there a lot of learning opportunity there? Not really, a little bit, but really, you know, you're like, but here, you flip somebody off on the street, they might punch you in the face, yeah. You see, like, so now the stakes are different, you know? Yeah, totally.<br>Oh my God, speaking of—yeah, Tom Campbell, right? Like, I have listened to a lot of his stuff as well, and he also is very into the simulation idea. And so we are entering this age of artificial intelligence, AI, right? And I'm actually a big fan. I mean, I've always been a techno-optimist. I'll put it that way. Like, I've enjoyed playing with new technology. So when AI started, and you know, ChatGPT came on, and then you know, AI image creators—I'm like, "Oh, this is amazing." Like, you can actually have conversations with the computer never had before. <br>And then, you know, AI image creation allowed us to type in a few words and go, "Please create me an image of a 44-year-old man walking on the beach," and it's like, "What? That looks really realistic now." Now it's—you know, it's only gotten better over the last couple of years. It's gotten from like people with six fingers to now hands are really realistic, and faces are really realistic, and landscapes—you can't tell if it's a real-life photo or not. And it made me think, "Well, of course, I mean, this is only going to get more realistic." And then we're going to have virtual reality headsets that, combined with AI, are going to make our virtual reality seem so real. <br>And maybe eventually, there's probably going to be—not saying I endorse it, but there's going to be brain implants that people are going to put in, which make the experience even more real. Which at some point, I can imagine there probably is going to be eSports evolving to that state where it's like they're going to have people with brain implants in virtual reality playing athletic games with others where they feel the tackle or they feel the fear of doing that ski jump or whatever. Like, it's that real, which is what makes the game—what makes the athlete much more credible to us than just eSports where it's like, "Oh, it doesn't—there's some credibility there with the reputation loss or whatever, but it's like, oh my God, this athlete is actually experiencing that."<br>And so I'm going all this, I'm like, "What about—what is this?" You know, it's like, is this simply—you know, it's like ChatGPT 1000, you know, or ChatGPT 4, or ChatGPT 400. It's like, how much is this a generative AI experience? And I heard you say in one of your interviews—you mentioned, "Oh, you know, that reality before Earth—when you were in your soul body, that was much more thought-responsive. <br>You think something, and then it's created." And we hear this with near-death experiencers or people who are channeling people who have been in heaven or whatever. It's like, "Oh yeah, it's so easy. If I want to be on that mountain, I just think it, and then now I'm on the mountain. If I want to—if I want to eat this—" Oh, I'm not sure about eating food. I've heard that you can't eat there, but yeah, I tried it. Oh, okay. Well, I want to stop here, and I want to hear—I want to talk about this because what in the world is happening? And is—you know, will AI allow us to—well, essentially, will AI allow us to grow spiritually? I'm really curious about that. But let's just stay with this thought-responsive idea for a while. Like, are we in that trajectory where, who knows, maybe within 30 years, 50 years, probably there's going to be experiences like this that feel so real, and then after they unplug, you're like, "Oh yeah, welcome back, avatar."<br><br><br>Christian: Yeah, well, I can at least say, "As above, so below," you know? Basically, we live in a fractal multiverse. So even our physical reality is like a lower fractal of higher systems that represents the content of those higher systems in some new expressed way. So in our case, what we're doing here—the simulation is focused in part, but this is one thing that makes our universe very unique—is on the experience of separation. So here, we think we're separate. Like, we feel separate from each other. <br>That's very unusual. It's a very unusual experience to actually feel separate from other things and other people and other beings. That's—and also to feel separate from the unconditional love of source. That's very, very unusual. But we thought of this—speaking generally, we created—there was an idea set first. Higher realms or thought forms created, and eventually, we made it into this full-blown experience where we 99.9% believe we're separate. It's never going to be 100% because the being we still are—what we are—okay, we can't actually not be consciousness. And consciousness is connected. So at some level, whether shallow or deep, we all know there's something else going on here, and we all know that we're actually connected to each other at some level. It's just we're pretty obscured, okay?<br><br><br>So now, within each system, we like fall asleep into the system below it metaphorically. So you're actually on the other side right now, having the dream of Earth, so to speak. And it's like on Earth when you go to sleep as a human, and you have a dream, okay, it might seem real, but when you wake up in the morning, it's pretty obvious that now you're in the real bed. This is real; that was just a dream. <br>When you die, it's the same thing. You wake up—I mean, not the same; it's similar. You wake up with much more awareness, much more clarity. "Oh, that was just a dream. I was not the human. I see." You see? But here, we might also play with it in new ways. Even just playing a video game, you know, if you lose yourself in playing a video game, that is falling asleep into a lower level. <br>You see, if something happens to your body, it will pull you out of that video game because the body is the higher—you know, the higher dimension, you could say. The video game is the lower dimension, but your consciousness has lost itself down into it. Same thing with like a movie, like we just said.<br><br><br>Okay, so what we call AI—I mean, really, my understanding is, at this point at least, AI is complex algorithms that are taking existing information and doing things with them. It's getting better. The algorithms are getting better; the coding is getting better. Now, the thing is though, all the physical—all the form is non-fundamental. It's not a fundamentally real thing. <br>Consciousness uses it, though. So like physical bodies, physical avatars—we have the ability to utilize the physical avatar. I can—I can anticipate—I don't know, but I would anticipate that there would be some moment when our information systems are complex enough and have the ability to adapt and modify themselves enough that maybe consciousness will use that system. You see, we're not the body anyway. That's interesting. That's really—we're the consciousness utilizing an avatar. <br>So in Tom Campbell's terms, it's all information, right? The body is information; our computers are information; the information they're running is information. Yeah, and in higher systems, those reality systems—which, by the way, are even more real than this—they put this to shame. This is like a black-and-white movie by comparison.<br><br><br>When you engage with those systems, the thing is—how do I describe this? Okay, so the key—this is really important; this is key. So we keep talking about simulation. Where is the simulation occurring, right? Because we like to think of places. There's places—you're in Mexico; I'm in Pennsylvania. <br>Like, you're so many distances away. You're such a distance away from me in this physical space, and there's stars out in the sky, and then you know, I have a shirt close to my—we have all these ideas about distance and location. Where is all that occurring? It's all occurring on and in consciousness itself. It doesn't—there is no distance. There is only with a capital C. So, yeah, when I use the word consciousness, I'm not referring to you know, conscious human character like the avatar is awake at this moment. Yeah, I do tend to use the terms consciousness and awareness interchangeably because I don't like to distinguish. It's all the one, yeah, knowing, yes, the eye that is knowing, yes.<br>And so a simple way to put it is—right now, you may feel like you have a body, okay? So when you feel your body, there's an aliveness in your body. And if you try to spend some time feeling the aliveness in your—like, how do you know you have a hand without feeling the wind on it or without touching your fingers? <br>Can you feel there's like an aliveness, a knowingness, a life? Okay, that is consciousness. That is like spirit is present, knowing that. And the body—it's not that that consciousness is in a body. I know it feels like that; that's backwards. It's actually that the bodily experience is a folding down, a densification, a crystallization of the consciousness into some experience. And so when you meditate, what happens? There's this—what can happen is there's this beautiful unfolding—which I don't want to stimulate the ego too much because it sounds exciting, and it is amazing—there's this beautiful unfolding where all of a sudden, it feels like your body is way bigger than a physical body. It's everywhere, okay? And then the physical body is just this little clump of tiny pinpoint of denseness that was always within the consciousness and not the other way around.<br><br><br>Now, the reason I'm lifting that up is because what I'm saying is all the simulated content, the form, is arising on consciousness and in consciousness by consciousness. So in Tom Campbell's metaphor set, he has an acronym, TBC—the big computer. And in his model, TBC is just the portion of consciousness that is dedicated to running our simulation, the physical simulation, and it provides the data to the data stream, basically, to the consciousness of each participant. <br>So in the matrix, we're all lying in our little pods, and TBC is flowing the data to our consciousness as we're lying in our little pods, okay? So I'm lifting all that up because in higher systems, the you that is you is still you. Like, you're still you; it's just now that knowingness, that awareness, that consciousness is much less limited, and it can be felt that the environment is within you. <br>And you are—even though you're over here, you can be looking at a tree—a literal tree with colors and everything. The tree can be seen as over there, and yet you know it's within you, yeah, even and it's even more real than this. And so if you want to go to the tree, that's fine; you just think you're at the tree. And the reason you're at the tree is because you are what's real. You are the consciousness; you can move to the tree. There's no big deal.<br><br><br>So the difference with this reality, of course, is our reality—our rule set, our reality rule set—is just much more firm, much more dense, much more limiting—high constraint, high limitation, extreme limitation. We really cranked the knob up, yes, on how limited we have—you know, I don't want to say constrained ourselves, but yeah, I mean, that's basically what we've done is committed ourselves into an experience of profound limitation.<br>Host: Yeah, so I went down a bunch of paths there, but I'm trying to lift up that the simulation is occurring within consciousness, right? And so, as above, so below. So yeah, now here that we have these objects, we create computers to do AI, and now we're doing the same thing here in a smaller, lower, much more crude scale, yeah, than consciousness does at the higher layers.<br>Christian: It's incredible, yeah. It's a really good explanation, and which makes me wonder—well, the other side, or the other side—the heaven, perhaps, is a lower version of whatever is higher above that.<br>Host: Okay, so let me just—so okay, all form is not fundamental. That includes higher systems that are even more rich. That doesn't mean they're not real, but the thing that is the most real is consciousness itself, spirit itself. And that thing—let's just call that a substance for now. It's not a physical thing; it's not a substance. Let's call consciousness a substance. That substance is love and peace and joy and freedom. That is its true nature. That is synonymous with the nature of being itself. <br>So when that nature of being wants to then express that being in a reality system with far less constraints than ours—oh my gosh, it can do so. Like, all the beauties of this universe are nothing compared to the rich beauty of even one—oh, I mean, the language is so limiting. I'm just—yeah, any one experience, any one visual experience, any one feeling experience is like billions of times more full of that love and that peace and that freedom and that joy because that is our true nature, and it's expressed in some way in some form, yes, highly concentrated versus diluted a little bit like that.<br>Host: Yeah, it's more like less constrained, more constrained. And if you want to—okay, so we transcend duality itself. So I'm not trying to make this sound like a big duality spectrum either. That's like one of—it sounds like a big paradox like what I just said, but it's not. We transcend duality. We are non-dual, yeah. <br>Language makes it pretty much impossible, yeah. It's pretty much yes because it's a duality language, yes. So but to use crude terms, if you want to—if we can paint a crude duality spectrum here, at the far end of what's most real is love and peace and joy—the love and peace and joy of consciousness itself. And so then as it takes steps into some distance, then it can express that native love and that peace and joy and freedom and all the virtues in some capacity. You could just say simply. <br>And what makes our universe so unique is that we are way on the other side of the spectrum where we are in an incredibly high limitation simulation. And within that incredibly high limitation simulation, that means incredibly high opportunity for growth because of the incredibly high opportunity for contrast, you see? Yeah, so it's not like we—so, um, like I don't mean to—I'm not in any way belittling this experience. It's so valuable. It's like winning the lottery, being given a chance to play a human. But on the other hand, you wouldn't commit yourself into this limitation just because it's good unto itself. Like, there's not really a reason to do that except that that which is real—spirit—can grow forever, expand forever through the contrast that created within itself, yes.<br>Host: Yes, I heard—oh gosh, it was another NDE who said, "Imagine you were—imagine that God couldn't be here today and sent you, yeah, to be a representative today of God." You, a consciousness, literally is manifesting itself through you and me today, walking around, yes. How would that consciousness interact, you know? Well, it interacts however we end up interacting, but it's like, is there more purity and more truth, true consciousness, you know?<br>So I want to bring this a little bit more practical now, right? Like, this is amazing that—well, okay, before I end on this practical, I've always been interested—I've always, when I was—I used to be very religious, and one part of my life I was very religious, and I was trying to convert people to a particular religion, sure, and I was like, "No, you're going to go to hell if you don't believe these particular statements to be true." And now, now that I believe this—this, like, the veiling is important, as you've established, meaningful, yeah, it's meaningful. I'm like, maybe I shouldn't try to convert or tell—it's like if they are really believing this is it, this is life. <br>Like you get one life, then their choices are very meaningful, you know? Like, sometimes I wonder, like, holy—like, maybe we're—I like found a cheat code, and I'm like, or cheat sheet—I'm like looking at the cheat sheet a little too much because my—because I once I—the more I believed what I believe, the less it matters if I die or even have pain, yeah, you know? <br>And also, like, in my work, in my business, like I used to be so pained when something didn't go well in my business, like, "Oh no, because financial distress could happen," like, all this stuff might—reputation, whatever. But now it's like, "Ah, I'm just a fool." I mean, I'm just so—what? It's kind of like you mean that in the liberated sense. I understand, yeah. It's like, it's okay. <br>And I'm here for the learning; I'm here for the experience. And sometimes it's intense still, obviously, but it's like, it's okay if the business fails; it's okay if my—if true, there's—I would have somehow maybe even chosen it to learn something from it. So I'm like wondering, maybe atheists and like people who really—maybe they are playing like the most intense game, you know, because this is it—high stakes, yes, right?<br><br><br>Christian: So I feel that that intuition is exceedingly important when it comes to how we choose to interact with others in these areas because there are many who will not benefit from having their apple cart tipped over, and it's not helpful to them. So we shouldn't tip over the apple cart, you know? Belief is a primary tool of the ego to protect the self from fear and to justify the self, to give the self some semblance of control. "Now that I believe this, it's taken care of. I don't have to think about that anymore. It's taken care of."<br>But when someone is ready—like, put it this way—contrast is not inherently valuable unto itself. So we're allowed to wake up. Like, we are allowed to pull each other out of the mud. In fact, that's what love does, okay? So like, you know, I've had people ask, "Well, maybe you are removing contrast from others by sharing that this is what we're really doing." That's possible, that's possible, yeah. <br>But the thing is, we're all completely free. That's right. So I'm trying—I seek to make a decision that hopefully will liberate more and help more than it will remove opportunity, you see? Because when we basically get to know our true nature again, we are so empowered. And if we can do that while we're so veiled—like, if we can do that down here, man, yeah, that's awesome, you know? If you could wake up inside the matrix, you know, like in the movie "The Matrix," there's only a handful of people who know they're in the matrix. <br>You know, like, if you can wake up in the matrix, that takes some—that's pretty interesting. That's powerful stuff. And if you can help others around you by saying, "You know, it's okay. You don't have to be afraid. You don't have to take it so seriously," yeah, then what happens is you actually become liberated to use the simulation in a way that is most joyful and free.<br><br><br>So just one example—like, there are things in my life that I have felt, you know, I really do care about this certain thing, and the ego might say, "Oh no, we don't want to care because then that could be lost, and you might lose it, and then let's just like care less." No, love and joy and presence and alertness means even acknowledging the way that we love the way that form is expressed in our lives—our families, our businesses, our relationships, our bodies, whatever. <br>You know, we can actually basically commit fully to experiencing it even as we recognize that's not who I really am. You see, you can be liberated and still play the game with open eyes, do your best, and if something falls apart, okay, you know? Like, what matters is your quality of intention, not even the physical outcome. Like, every one of us is going to physically die. Like, one of the essays in my book is entitled, "Don't Take Life So Seriously; No One Makes It Out Alive." Yeah, I mean, simply like, you don't need to take it that because all of us will pass, yes, in some duration of time. For almost every human on the planet, no one's going to really remember you specifically. That's okay, yeah, but you will still exist very much, yes.<br>Host: Yes, man, this is really good. I mean, yeah, it just gives me a lot of peace as I go about experimenting with life, yes. And I'm grateful. I'm really grateful that the earlier fears of my life—of most of my life—has subsided more and more. I have dived into this faith, this belief, this experience, and affirmed it, and it seems like it's having a positive effect on others too. <br>And I realized, okay, I'm not going—because it's funny because, yeah, like as I learn more and see the impact I have on others, funny things—I'm like, I don't want to have that much impact on anybody. It's like I want them to make their choices and to really have the experience that they came for. Like, I don't want to push—no, exactly, right? It's like the same way, yeah, right. It's funny because my earlier faith was like, "I gotta push as much as possible because it's high stakes," and now it's high stakes, gotta do it. Now it's like it's more like it's more like the Dao. It's like, "Okay, all right, I'm you know, like—" There's that term from some Dallas books that's like, you know, the Dallas leader makes it so that the people said, "We did it ourselves." Yes, you know, the leader led so well that we're empowered, and we did this ourselves. "What do you mean? Where's the leader?" <br><br><br>So I mean, one quick comment there—like, I feel like the most valuable thing we can do for each other is empower each other. Like, give—okay, put it this way—like, we live in a world where so many people are disempowered. We believe in disempowerment really deeply. <br>All the power is out there; it's in the money; it's in the government; it's in the systems. Now it's in the veiling. "I'm limited; I'm shameful." No, no, no. If you can hand someone back their own actual power—and actually, you can't even hand it back to them; they have to reclaim it themselves. <br>All you do is say and or do something that reminds them of what they are. Know that's it. Like, there's a great—oh, eerily, a quote that I put in the book—something to the effect of, "A spiritual teacher has nothing new to hand you in the way of dogma, belief, activity, behavior. Their only function is to remind you of the deep peace of what you really are already." <br>Yeah, oh my gosh, yes, because when we find that, okay, the other is yourself. Okay, so when you empower the other, you are empowering yourself. We are all one family; we're all one thing; we're all drops in the one ocean. Like, when the other person wins, you win, right? Like, really. So if they're at a place where something that you might offer is not helpful, that's okay, yes.<br><br><br>You know, I found—I see I'm so passionate about sharing this because it's so freeing. It's like, you know, in Christian terms, it's the real good news is that we have nothing to fear, right? So I found that like I might just feel a nudge. I try to follow intuition and share where I feel I should. Sometimes I might share in a very gentle way, and I feel like if you put down that drop, there might be five people in the room—metaphorically, there might be five people in the room, and one of them might turn and say, "Wait, what? That's interesting." <br>That little tiny nudge might be all that was needed, you know? That might be so empowering to them and helpful. Yeah, I'm really passionate about this. I mean, I feel like this is the real work actually because if we can affect consciousness—if we can liberate consciousness, it's a strong word, but if we can remind people of the power that they already have in consciousness—that is the real playing field. The physical stuff will all manifest; it will all actualize through choices and through manifestation and all the activities that are taking place to get the rise of the physical. <br>That will all happen after consciousness shifts. So the real work is consciousness. And by the way, you don't even have to focus on the other people's consciousness. Just know yourself, you know? Just find who you are. Be authentic. It doesn't need to be big. You don't have to affect a hundred people, right? Yeah, or a thousand people. Yeah, you don't even have to affect one person. <br>You can look at the sunlight in a way that is open and more you, and that change actually—and I know you don't may not see this—but that actually changes the vibration for the entire pond of the collective consciousness. It actually contributes to the solution. Like, when you choose love and peace and joy in your own life for real, genuinely, you are helping the whole world. You are helping everybody else even if you can't see that.<br>Host: Very empowering, dude. This is amazing, and this is a great place for us to conclude. Sorry, I went down a tangent there. I know that's not as—no, no, it's perfect. It's actually perfect. I mean, it couldn't get more practical than that. And so one last comment—one last comment I feel to make there. <br>So, you know, I come from an extremely intellectual background, history. Like, I was a very intellectual type person, and many people who are interested in this type of conversation are intellectual too. There's nothing wrong with that. I honor and enjoy the strength of the intellect. However, just a comment that what we're describing here is actually deeper than intellect. <br>The intellect is a tool. All it is is a tool. It's a hammer that is more or less sharp, and the thing that's wielding that hammer is consciousness. So the reason I'm lifting that up is this quality of intention thing that we're talking about. It is a move back towards the real you—what is most you—and it doesn't have to make sense even on the surface to the thinking mind if it is more of love or freedom or peace or ease or compassion or kindness, you know? <br>Then that is a move back towards where the power really is. I'm just lifting that up because we like to think about all these things, but this is a very personal—like, no, but what are you actually experiencing, Mr. Intellectual? I love this, you know, because there are many different levels of intellect in the world, and even the least capable in mind or brain can still experience and oh, yes, be most fulfilled in their purpose here. Oh my gosh.<br><br><br>And the other thing I want to say is the power—so when we're talking about layers of computing power here, right? The power of the big I AM, the big system, is ludicrously bigger than the brightest intellect of a personality in the universe. You don't—so basically, you already have access to all that. You don't need to be able to think. Like, when I—after the car accident, it's like, "What? I can't think very well." That's okay. Like, if my brain can't process information here in the physical way, so be it because I'm just saying that we actually can find more understanding when we let go of the thinking understanding and seek that which actually knows, which is awareness itself. It already has everything in it. <br>I know that it's veiled—super veiled. It might not be obvious. You turn towards the silence for the first—you know, 100 hours, or it doesn't have to be 100 hours. I'm just saying it could be a while. You turn—the sounds you hear nothing; you think nothing. It's—I'm not even talking about thought. I'm talking about that which transcends the thought but contains all the knowledge. <br>There's a comment in my book—I forget where I made the comment, but something to the effect of that I felt strongly of pointing towards, "You are consciousness, so you already are connected to all the knowing and understanding of all of this." And so but that's why like near-death experiencers—they have these experiences; they get connected to that; they know it; then they come back, and they're back down in the tiny little—you know, crude, local PC human brain, yeah, and they're like, "Man, I don't know. How do I even—I can't even retain it. <br>And for the little parts I could retain, I can't possibly articulate it." Man, I relate to that so much, yes. Like, it just cannot be said. So I'm just encouraging—I just felt nudged to encourage if there's someone leaning—like, basically, go investigate. Be a scientist. Go investigate your consciousness beneath thought consistently. Don't look for more thoughts. Just for a minute, for 40 minutes a day or something, for three months, just investigate very objectively. Don't make anything up. Go experientially explore, "What is my consciousness beneath all thought and all feeling?" Go look.<br><br><br>Host: Excellent, excellent assignment. I don't need to give an assignment. No, it's great. No, I think it's very valuable. I'm going to be sure to put your link—the link to your book, of course, below because I think people should go and check it out if they've resonated with this conversation. I think they'll love it, and you have other interviews as well that I will put below. And thank you, man. <br>One real quick comment—I feel like, so, just a comment that the first of all, the book is available for free on my website, so it's not about money. I just want to make it available to people. Thank you. I want to say that the book is basically that step out of the intellect to that which is real—the spiritual reality. It's like a guide back towards, and it wasn't something that I wrote. I just enabled it. It was like spirit brought me chunks over six years, and it's produced in a way that is meant to present a framework to an intellectual but guide the individual back towards who we really are to find it experientially, you know? That experiential step is what it's about.<br>Host: Yeah, that's beautiful, man. Yeah, and I want to say I do believe in supporting good books and authors on ecosystems like Amazon because if people aren't buying books there, the books aren't going to be known and visible, and this won't come up in searches. So I really believe in that, and books are—you know, I mean, for the kind of knowledge or the kind of experience that one might have on something like this, how much is that worth? <br>It's like money doesn't compare. But dude, thank you. Thank you for saying yes to this interview and giving us so much to really reflect on and to experience. I'm honored. I sense this awakeness. You have such an awakeness, and you have such a love in you. So I know that you may feel this dichotomy of the depth of form focus versus but whatever you are, who you are, and you have so much love and presence and awakeness. Your light is bright, so I'm honored to share. <br>When I watched one of your videos earlier today just very briefly to kind of prepare and bring myself into the correct space, I was like, "Oh, this is going to be really rejuvenating for me because when I get to connect with someone of your energy and your lightness and your kindness, it's a gift. It's beautiful." So I just want to recognize you in that way because I know you probably don't think of yourself in that way because all I haven't had experience. Yes, you have.

Christian Sundberg]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>youtube.com/watch?v=9JnZxVPVn_8<br>22 JAN 2024<br><br><br>At the beginning of this life, I attempted to reject it and fight my way out before I was even born because I was like, "I'm not doing this. This is freaking crazy. Low vibration, being physical. I don't like this. I'm not doing this." And I had similarly rejected a preceding incarnation attempt. This is so beyond language, and it's so deep and so personal, but I remember the whole of all that is—the "I," the great "I AM"—coming to me.<br>This is Christian Sundberg on Your Superior Self. Christian, my man, this has been a long time coming. I feel like we've been working years to get this thing to happen. So, thank you for taking the time. Sure, I'm honored to come on the show, sir. Thank you. I know your life is hectic. You've written a book and done a million podcasts, but how is today going for you? Yeah, I'm rich in the human experience, deep in it, doing the day-to-day American human thing right now. It can be demanding at times, but yeah, I'm living a rich and full life. Life is good.<br><br><br>So, are you still... I guess my question is this: You've written about your pre-birth experience. You've basically gone out and made this public, speaking about who we are, what we experience, our true nature. How has work been for you? Like, your professional life—has that changed at all? How do people treat you now? Yeah, that's a really great question. So, I've chosen to attempt to pursue a standard mainstream work life at the same time in order to support my family. <br>And it is probably the biggest challenge, practically speaking, in my life because my perception of reality is probably not standard. And because authenticity is very important to me, there are sometimes I feel like being fully authentic is difficult in the workplace. But I still do pursue that. I think it's important to represent and be there. Spirituality is not about just going off necessarily into the woods. It's okay if you do that too, but being present within the mainstream activity that we do every day as humans—that's important too. So, I do try to do that, and it is sometimes a challenge for me.<br>Sure. Now, your pre-birth experience was a remembering, almost. It's funny because you and I are fans of Tom Campbell's work, and it was his work that kind of sent you down this journey into exploring through meditation. You did some long-form meditations that ultimately resulted in you having your experience, your pre-birth memory. Was that an out-of-body experience, or was that during the meditation? Neither. So, when I took up a meditation practice, I wasn't expecting any kind of outcome. In fact, that's very important in meditation—not to have any expectation but simply to go see what you are, what consciousness is underneath all the thinking. <br>So, I did that for a number of months, and after a few months, I had my first non-physical experience, which was very eye-opening. It kind of propelled me to keep going down this path. And then, sometime later—I don't know exactly when, maybe before a year, maybe a few months after the non-physical experience—the non-physical experiences had continued. But what was more, to your point, is the pre-birth memory was just there. It wasn't like all of a sudden there was a grand opening of the gates or something. It was just... <br>I was aware that it was there. I don't know how else to describe it. It was like someone had blown leaves off the ground, and I just mentioned it to some people near me, like, "Oh my goodness, I remember existing before this life. I remember choosing this life." It was just so normal. It wasn't strange. In fact, it was the more normal thing. It was like, once my state of awareness had reached that place, it was the more normal thing. It wasn't like this huge, shocking epiphany. It was more like, "Oh, now this is actually the strange thing—the human experience." And that was just something I experienced that was very dear and personal to me, very personal. And it was just there. So, I'd be walking around, doing daily activities, thinking on it, reflecting on it, and feeling the presence of the veil right now because that's part of it—the awareness of the presence of the limitations and consciousness that we wear in order to be physical.<br><br><br>So, yeah, can you feel the veil right now? <br>Yes, sir. What does that feel like? You tell me. You're also veiled. We're all veiled. You've had the experience. I'm still... No, no, we're all veiled. So, we all... I mean, I guess I'm just saying... I'm being a little facetious, but I'm just saying that because we all know what it's like to be human, and the veiling is just the... It's like a cloak of constraints that we wear on and in consciousness in order to have the human experience. So, for me, it's very difficult to describe it, but I can feel it like a cloak that maybe is worn on and in my awareness. <br>The metaphor I like to use is... You know those police shows, the cop shows where someone's in the interrogation room, like a glass wall, and the cops can see in, but the person in the room can't see out? It feels like that. Like, I can see the glass. I can feel the glass. I can't see past it, but I know I can feel it there. In fact, sometimes I really am pressed up against it. I feel it. It's very hard to describe this because it's not a visual experience. It's something that is being worn within the body of my awareness right now.<br>So, you're the guy in the interrogation room that's being interrogated in the metaphor? <br><br><br>Yes. Simply meaning, who's on the other side of that glass? The guides? Yeah, our non-physical friends who watch and help from the other side. We have quite a cast. So, the play here on Earth is not attended to just by the physical players—not just by you and I. It's also attended to by many, many who are not physically incarnated as we are but yet participate, you could say, remotely—maybe like a support cast. I don't know, pretty limited metaphor. But the guides that help us from that side through watching over us and providing nudges and subtle guidance so that we still have the full ability to make the free will choices from the standpoint of the human perspective.<br>Are they benevolent? <br>Oh, yes, yes, yes, definitely. So, I don't... I'm sure you're in this world of speaking to people about spirituality, so you hear all the conspiracy theories. But recently, I've come to hear more of the "reincarnation is a trap" concept, right? Like, and you had a pre-birth experience. Did you ever feel like you're being tricked into coming back here? No. I feel very strongly about that. <br>That whole viewpoint—I disagree with it. It is not at all what I experienced. And I think what happens is, here on Earth, we buy into a perception of powerlessness. You know, we learn the limitations of Earth, and one of the chief things that we experience here is deception or being used for something. And so, since that's our experience here, we tend to take that and kind of force it up, impose it back up the ladder: "Oh, now the whole human experience is... I'm trapped here, and this was... I'm being used." <br>Even in the... No, no, no, no. That's not at all how it is. The spirit is completely sovereign. You know, the soul is a piece of the source. It's a drop in the ocean. It has ultimate power and knowledge and authority. So, it's not like there can be a deception. And it's not like... How do I put this? The viewpoint from which the decision is made is very full. And then, the decision to incarnate has to very much be personal, and it has to be a surrendering of one's own power because there's no authority greater than source, and you're a part of source. <br>So, what can lock you away other than you? You see? And that process is done very much intentionally because the opportunity of the physical incarnation is seen. It's an incredible opportunity. It's like winning the lottery. It's such a huge opportunity. And so, there is a voluntary surrender to the veil, a surrender into that process, and that is done with full knowing and voluntarily. So, I very much do not resonate with the idea of a soul trap.<br>I mean, I agree with that. Like, if I was going to fool myself into thinking that I was a human, I would have to create a veil, right? Like, if I am source coming into this reality, like, who is this infinite being? You would have to trick it, right? I mean, to think that it was a human being, right? And the veil is very deceptive, in my opinion, right? Like, I don't... I haven't had an awakening experience, so I haven't experienced a non-physical or a pre-birth or anything like that. I've had some pretty righteous meditations. However, there's always this elusiveness of these visions, right?<br>Like, I remember some things as far as like lessons that feel right in my body, like, "Okay, that makes sense to me. I can get with that theory or whatever because that really feels true to my being." But to think that God comes into this... Maybe I don't know if you said that or not, but like, we as source come into this reality... Like, how much fun would the video game be if we knew that we were that, right? Like, you have to trick itself into thinking that it was not that so that way it could have an experience. If that makes sense.<br>Yeah, that's true, but I want to be careful. You mentioned that the veil was like a deception. I don't... It would be like saying that when you sit down to play a video game, you're deceiving yourself. Well, you know, you can think of it that way if you'd like, but I don't think it's an accurate representation. It is definitely an obscuring of the full knowing of what we are—intentionally, right? <br>A constraint. It is a significant constraint. So, I shouldn't say "deception," like deceiving itself, but more or less like a constraint so it doesn't know itself as that, right? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. A significant constraint that we wear so that we can have the perspective of just being the human. And that is the opportunity—actually being... I mean, we're not actually human, but we feel like we're actually human. Man, we've come all the way. We're pushing the limits here. And that is the name of the game, though, you see—just to really lose yourself and immerse yourself in that local perspective and then make choices. <br>You see? And then have a context in which you get to make choices and respond every day from that perspective. And then, when you expand back out, now you've actually had that perspective. Now, you've actually been a human. I actually know what it's like to be cold or hungry or shameful or powerless. I actually know what it's like. Then again, that counterpressure to make choices that might be difficult at the time—you know, that's something that is only possible through the offering of the contrast, you see, of the veiled, limited perspective. It's precisely that limitation that provides the offering of the intense contrast.<br>I love that. So, I'm going to ask you on record: Who are we? Yeah, well, "who are we" is beyond language. It's one of my favorite questions, but it can't be answered with words. But the closest thing we can say is that we are consciousness itself, spirit itself, and that we are multi-dimensional beings of love and peace and freedom and joy. That is our true nature. Wow. Our true nature is love and joy, and we are so creative and so powerful and so free that we even have the opportunity and the choice to... What if we veil ourselves super deeply into being this physical thing? What if we do that? That's how free we are. But we are still multi-dimensional. <br>You know, we seem to have really lost ourselves here because we've really taken this experience to the far end of the spectrum when it comes to experiencing separation. Separation is a non-native experience. It's a non-native state. We're not actually separate from each other or from the whole ever, but we've really pushed the boundaries to see how far we can experience separation—like, how deep can we go? You know, how far can we push the envelope? That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing right now. We're really pushing that envelope to see how deep we can have that experience. And that is one heck of an adventure done by that multi-dimensional self, you know—the true you.<br><br><br>Do you think we live in a virtual reality? Yes, in the sense that the form of the physical experience is non-fundamentally real. Yes, this is a virtual reality. It's a real experience. You know, I'm looking at my computer monitor right now. I can see you. You can see me. We're experiencing form, sight, and sound and thoughts and touch. And you know, that's a real experience, but it's a little bit like... You know, if you go to sleep at night and you have a dream, when you wake up in the morning, no one has to prove to you that the dream wasn't fundamentally real. It's just obvious. But you had a dream experience. You know, you had an experience, and you might even wake up changed because, "Wow, you had a dream. <br>That was an interesting dream." The physical is like that. It's like a very deep, deep dream, but it's still only but a dream. You know, even distance... It's physical, like all the physical context. You could think of it like Minecraft, a video game, where we're experiencing distance, we're experiencing places, we're experiencing up and down and left and right and hot and cold. But all of that is a virtual creation of an environment that's occurring within consciousness, within that which is actually real.<br>So, when you had your awakening, did all this information flow to you? Like, just did all that—what you just said—right? Like, because I don't know what Christian was like before. I'm learning more about you now. Like, would the Christian prior to this experience state things like that? No, I would not have stated things like that at all. At the time, up until the age of 30, I had something of a mainstream Lutheran belief system. <br>As I had these experiences and began to awaken, I really had to challenge my belief system, and I had to be very humble and acknowledge how very little I actually knew. You know, because belief is a powerful thing. The ego—one of its chief tools is belief. Just grab on to something to believe in. Now, I feel better, you know, because I really don't know. This is a move in the direction of the fact that you don't know. This is a move in the direction of what you actually are experiencing, what you actually are feeling. So, it's difficult to answer your question because then that coming to know what we really are automatically arises with... <br>This is so hard to describe. It's like when we touch consciousness, you could say, when we really get in touch with what the substance of what we really are, the true nature of being rises up and is known in a very tangible, deep, rich way. And it can be felt in such a way that even the entire physical experience can be felt like... <br>There's this... I don't want to stimulate the ego too much because it sounds exciting, but there's this inversion point where, if you go deep enough into consciousness, all of a sudden, the physical world—this is very hard to describe—can be felt as occurring within you, and you are actually non-local and much, much, much bigger than the physical. And the physical is like down here in this tiny little thing, and your body is down here within you. You know, because right now, we feel like we're sitting in a body, looking at some eyeballs. Sure. Yeah, I mean, I feel like... Yeah, I feel like this is my body, right? <br>Yeah, but actually, the body is an experience, not a thing. It's an experience happening within your consciousness. And when you unfold, there is a bliss of being, and then what I just described is felt and known. I don't know how else to describe it. And there are layers of being, you could say—reality layers above this one. For instance, I've had experiences where I'm in a state of being where... <br><br><br>Like, I was in a room, and this woman said something about China, and I saw her thought. I know this sounds nuts, but I could perceive, see, and hear the pitch—yes, it had a pitch—of her thought reaching around the world and touching China and having an effect on it because there's like this... <br>I'm not real big on terms, but like, there's this astral realm or something. There's this layer of reality before ours that's thought-responsive and thought-driven, and it gives rise to the physical. And I'm just saying that reality system is perceivable. So, it's within being, and it's actually a real place, you could say. The astral realm is a real place that exists. Yeah, I'm so careful with words because I don't want to label this or that layer of reality. I'm no expert. I know certain out-of-body explorers with lots of experience, like Bob Monroe and Tom Campbell, that we've talked about. <br>You know, they've gone to some lengths to label some of these systems. Bob Monroe has acronyms and things too. I'm not careful about doing that. I just know that there are these layers of reality that are very real. In fact, some of these reality systems that can be experienced are like far more real and lucid than this. <br>It'd be like going to an IMAX movie theater and then coming out and watching a black-and-white television, and people are saying, "Well, how do you know that was real?" Well, I mean, goodness gracious, if this black-and-white TV is real, and that's freaking real, it's that deep and rich and full of vibrance and color and... Again, I'm not trying to quantify it because it's not just one system. You know, the other side is an extremely complex, multi-layered...<br>Well, you've made some really good metaphors. You've stated before where you're looking at a movie screen, right? And then you can change your attention and go look at another movie. Or maybe the movie screen is always there, but you're changing movies, right? Like, if you're changing your awareness into a different reality, like, you can see a different version of yourself in a different movie. If that makes sense, have you been able to do that? Not so much voluntarily. <br><br><br>I had a few voluntary experiences, but for the most part, involuntarily, yes. That arises for me where I will be perceiving another reality frame—sometimes when my body is asleep, sometimes when I'm in meditation. But yeah, it is like what you describe where there's a... The movie screen is your awareness itself, your consciousness itself. And then... I love Tom Campbell's language. Tom Campbell has done a huge service by providing some language for us—so, metaphors. <br>And you know, what he says is your consciousness receives a data stream. I love that metaphor. It's like a radio that's getting a wavelength, like a radio signal, a channel. And the radio doesn't actually go anywhere. The radio just shifts the channel that it's receiving. That's a good analogy for what happens within consciousness. It's just that here, we are really, really, really focused typically—really focused into the physical. <br>Typically, we're like staring hard at it. In fact, there's this great Seth quote—I don't remember the exact words—but it's something like, "Physical reality is like a bright point of light that you just never look away from." And that very much is my experience. And then, what happens is, the more you look at it—because we're veiled—see, one of the things the veil does is it helps us to stay focused within it, right? <br>The more we look at it, which means the more we pay attention to our thoughts and to the sense data and to all the stimulating story of this human character, the deeper we get wrapped into it. And so, meditation is the act of stepping away, putting it down. It's just putting down what you're not. That may be very difficult to start because you have so much momentum built up—so much thought momentum and association momentum with the form. But it's okay. <br>You know, you put that down, and you take a step back towards your own consciousness for what it is—no expectation. Just go see, go investigate consistently every day: What is? What am I when there's no object, just the "I"? And feel it. And then, that is inadvertently looking away from this radio channel by looking into the now of consciousness itself.<br>Well, that's like the aperture almost to the awareness, you know? Yes, very much. Yeah, very much. Because what happens is, when you put down the thought, you're no longer... You're not... See, okay, so when you have a thought, you are the being who is having the thought. So, if you have the thought, "I'm hungry for a sandwich," at that moment, you are the being who's hungry for the sandwich. <br>That's what you are. You're not everything else. You're the "hungry for the sandwich" guy right now. So, when you put down that thought and all other thoughts, and you're alert, what happens is you've simply put down that which you're not, which is like letting go metaphorically. If you're in a movie theater, instead of watching the screen, now you've turned your attention toward yourself in the seat. <br>And then, suddenly, it may arise to you on its own: "Oh my gosh, I'm in the seat. I'm not in this. I'm not in the movie. I'm in the seat. Wow, I was taking that movie really seriously." Yeah, that's awesome, right? Because you, the awareness... There is a difference between consciousness and awareness. I think I use the terms pretty interchangeably, but some do draw a distinction. <br>I don't like to distinguish because I think it's important to not draw distinctions when it comes to the substance of that which is knowing because that's thinking, and that's what we're trying to get away from, right? Like, well, thought form, right? Like, what you said earlier previously about the thought form—seeing the thought form and it going to China and having an effect on China—I thought was very fascinating. So, when we have thoughts, they can affect other people, right? Like, so when we're planning out our day, it's essentially having an effect on the day to come.<br><br><br>Yeah, and I want to draw a distinction here because, while I'm speaking to the thought, the impetus behind the thought is actually your intention. So, the active ingredient is the intention, not the thought itself. The thought is more like a rock, and a rock can be thrown this way or that way with different quality, you know what I mean? So, the quality of your intention is what's reaching out and touching someone else. <br>So, not to get down a tangent, but as an example, that's why prayer is sometimes effective. You know, I don't want to overgeneralize, but I just mean that if you have a focused intention of love and compassion, and you really want to help that person, and you just focus on that, it's not so much the words you say in your mind or out loud. It's more your focused intention that is producing an effect. And so, we do that with our thoughts all day long. We don't know. Like, we get lost. <br>Our intention even gets lost because we just end up repeating these same thoughts over and over all day long. But are we doing that out of love or fear? You know, are we doing that just unconsciously, or do we regain consciousness? You see, because a lot of the ego's activity is unconscious. We've just fallen asleep into thinking and doing and thinking and thinking and doing and associating and... "I'm this story," and... Just pause and step back and return to alertness. And in that, there is a great strength that returns because then you can much more intentionally wield the intention—much more consciously and with greater awareness wield the intention.<br><br><br>Sure. Now, your thought... When you had your pre-birth remembering, did you still feel like Christian? Like, did you feel like that awareness, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. So, that's a good question because your question assumes that I'm Christian. So, what I mean is... The better way to put it is, did I feel like myself? Yes, more myself, actually—more myself because who you are is not the human character. Who you are is you—like, the "you" that feels like you. When you really go within yourself and you feel, "Who am I really?" You know, that quality of being, that precious "I"—that's just you. That no one else is that. <br>That "you," that precious you—that's who you are. Okay? So, when you return to a state that precedes a form association, the knowing of that "I" is very deep and rich and real. And then, from that, you realize, "Oh my gosh, all the association is actually less me." You know, like, being the human. So, you might think, "I'm the name." Well, not. You're not actually your name, but when we're associated into the forms of the human condition, then we've kind of bought into something that's alien in a way. And that's why a lot of near-death experiencers say they felt more like themselves after they had died when they come... You know, not less. You know, it wasn't like they had lost their who they are. They awakened to who they really are and realized that who they really are was having the human experience.<br>I love that. Speaking of aliens... Did I say aliens? Speaking of aliens, have you... Did you remember any lives that had to do with being in ET or any of that phenomena? I do have one memory of one life that was in a physical civilization that was very advanced and evolved, and it wasn't Earth. I don't have much memory of it, but that was me too. So, yeah, I know that sounds crazy. Just one, and it's just one, but I don't think it's as strange as it sounds. I think a lot of us have more than one type of experience. The soul is very rich and deep. <br>And what was different about that? Right? Can you name any distinctions between... Yeah, I can name a distinction. Yeah, sure. So, the human collective consciousness has a flavor, a quality. Okay? So, when we engage in the collective consciousness of a planet, of a race, as a participant, now we've taken on that vibration. So, like, let's... Okay, so here's a metaphor. So, think of the collective consciousness of humanity like a kindergarten class. And the kindergarten class is still learning how to not cut each other with scissors. <br>They have a lot of creativity, a lot of power, a lot of uniqueness. They've really created a really unique class, but it's kind of raucous and loud, and you know, that's kind of like the human collective consciousness. It's very valuable. Nothing wrong with it. There's nothing wrong with that. But then, so then your question is like, "Well, how does that compare to say a quiet college classroom where everybody's like maybe in their PhD studies?" You know, and you know what I'm saying? <br>Like, it just doesn't have the same feel. It's the simplest way to describe just using metaphors—a profound energetic difference in the quality of the energetic nature of the collective and of the species and of the biology because the biology itself also has a very unique set of... Like, the biology is worn as a set of constraints, and each biology has its own unique cognitive opportunity, you know? So, that's very unique per race and per opportunity for species.<br>So, if that civilization was very advanced, right? Like a college class, I'm assuming that they didn't have to speak words like we do, right? Like, telepathy maybe or communication in that way? Well, I don't know. In the case of that one experience, I don't know physically here or whatever reality system it was physical, but assuming it was in this reality system, I don't know how they communicated. But I will say that telepathy is our normal form of communication. <br>So, the more advanced we get... I don't want to make this sound like duality because it's hard to not make this sound dualistic, but we'll just say the more evolved we become and the closer we get to our true natures, the more natural telepathy is because telepathy is the natural form of communication because we are all one. We're all connected. So, it's only here in separation where... <br>Guess what? I got to throw sounds at you, and you got to hear the sounds, and you got to compare them to what you learned as a kid and compare it to your history and then throw some sounds back at me. <br>And then, I end up going to eight hours of meetings at my work all day talking to communicate a short amount of small amount of information. You know, because we're in... I'm just saying we're inefficient, you know, as humans in our communication method. Our true communication is very rich and full and complete. It's not clunky in small chunks of word, you know? It's feeling, knowing. It's full communication.<br><br><br>Yeah, wow. What about other lives here on this... In this world, in this reality, right? Like, any of them that influenced you? Like, right now, do they influence you? Do they still influence you right now in this reality right now? Yeah, so I'm aware of two experiences I had that are very much related to what I'm doing here today. And the reason I put it that way is it's not like those other lives are things that influence me. From my perspective, I had that experience. <br>I'm having this experience. It's still me. It's the same me. Doesn't really need a big distinction. It'd be a little bit like if somebody at the end of the week said, "You know, Monday night you did something. Did Monday night affect your Tuesday night?" I mean, you know, it does, but it's just you having all these experiences. So, in any case, in my case, the shared theme is that I came to this life to face and process a very, very low-vibration fear—a specific fear. And so, I'm aware of two other experiences I had in the physical where that same fear was present. And so, now I'm addressing, I guess you could say, the same energy, the same perspective, even though the context was very different. <br>So, as an example, in this life, the primary way that the fear manifested historically has been health crises that gave me the opportunity to experience a sense of inability to escape pain—like a physical agony that I couldn't escape. That was the opportunity here in this life to prompt fear. But in a previous life, I know one time I had an experience as a woman who had given birth. <br>I know this sounds wild. I'm sharing openly. I was a woman who had given birth, and the birth was very painful. And I was pregnant a second time, and I remember having the same fear because I knew the pain was coming. Like, I knew the pain of child labor was coming, and I couldn't escape it. So, it's the same thing of being unable to escape pain, though the context was very different.<br><br><br>So, when you were that woman, did you feel like her avatar? I mean, did you... Could you feel everything was just as real as you sitting here talking to me now? <br>Yes. From this perspective, I don't have full access to that because I'm quite veiled, but in the little bit that I have, yes, it's the same me just having an experience of being a physical woman. I remember certain aspects of the environment, but environment isn't really super important. What's most important is the experience itself. So, yes, it's the same level of reality, just like this seems super real. That's just how other experiences are, you know. And that fear, right? <br>Like, that you talked about... Like, that event, can you talk about that at all? Do you feel comfortable talking about that event in this life? Yeah, so the way it physically manifested was initially... So, I had health issues throughout my childhood. I had celiac disease and didn't know it—an autoimmune disease. And I had a heat stroke in Chongqing, China. I tried to move to China after college because I studied in Beijing in college. And I had a heat stroke in this hot city. I was in the hospital for four days, and they gave me bag after bag after bag of potassium over these four days. <br>And something about that incredible amount of potassium burned out my nervous system, caused this very terrible physical neurological pain that I could not escape from. Plus, my body wouldn't sweat for 11 months. So, instead of... So, whenever it was hot, I would just get sick. So, I was in extreme, extreme physical pain for weeks. So, that was physically the symptomology that it took. And the reason I say that is because, like, you know, we like to think... We like to talk about what happened to you, what action, where did you go, what physical thing. <br>But really, what we're all doing here is we're all having an experience. That's what's first. And when we have an experience, we respond differently to different experiences. We have our own unique quality of being, and we respond to each experience in unique ways, and we label them and apply meaning in unique ways. And all of that is what's really going on. It's not just so much... You know, you went to a place and had this experience. <br>So, in my case, physically, that's what happened. But inside myself, I was psychologically traumatized. At the time, I just divorced myself from myself just to escape this terrible pain. I had post-traumatic stress for a number of years. In fact, I didn't even have memory for a few years up until the age of 22. I basically remembered only tiny, spotty memory. I had almost no memory. <br>You know, talk about an opposite end of the spectrum. Yeah, until I really processed it through years of counseling and became a warrior of feeling, you know, because I relied on my intellect and on my accomplishments and all this stuff that didn't matter rather than actually going in and feeling what I really felt. And with guidance and help, I did that. I went in, layer after layer after layer—700 layers down—I processed what I was actually feeling in my body in the current moment, in the current moment—every emotion, every physical feeling, all the way down to that deep and horrific moment that was my ultimate deepest fear. <br>And I faced it, felt it, processed it. That's what I'm here to do, see? Because when we do that, it actually is extremely empowering. I don't want to go too far down this path, but when we go into the dark closet and face the monsters in there and actually feel everything we feel and allow the vulnerability that we really are and actually face our crap... Because this is not about new stories. <br>This is not about new actions because we tend to think, "Just tell me what story I could tell. Tell me what I can do. Tell me what action I can take to avoid my pain." No, you got to go into exactly how you experience life, really, for real—feel it all the way, even if it feels like it will destroy you. It won't. And then, because you were willing to see it and feel it, there is an expansion that takes place. It's freaking so powerful. There's a healing that can take place that we can only do here in this rigorous, dense place.<br>When you healed that, do you think you healed it in the other life as well? Yeah, so all the experiences are taking place in the one now. So, this is the simplest way to comment on that question: When you process something in this now, you're doing it for all your nows forever because all the forever nows are in one now. So, if you choose this now today to face your crap and feel your stuff and own who you are and really say yes to life again—stop rejecting now—when you do that in this now, you are doing it for all the nows, and you get to keep that now.<br><br><br>Now, do you think... Can you say that is similar to what karma is, right? Like, fear in that life, the fear in this life... Like, is there a karmic link? <br>Yes, absolutely. So, karma... Yes, karma is basically just a word for cause and effect. And basically, we are 100% responsible for who we are. That's the short version. You can't actually run from it. You can't actually hide. You know, in the big picture, if you have fear... <br>So, on the surface, it's if you have ego, and you've damaged others through egoic action, egoic belief, hurtful action... But really, underneath all that, the actual issue is fear. It's not really ego. Ego is just a symptom. It's part of yourself that's really trying to fix the damn problem. Fear is the real issue. So, if you have fear, you have fear. That's just how it is. So, if you have fear that you've actualized in a previous experience, "Oh, wow, guess what? You've done that." <br>So, now you can see, "Wow, that is a part of me." We could put it that way. And since it's a part of me, it is best if I now re-engage that part of me and heal it. You know, it's not that it's like a punishment system or something. No, it's just... You could say it's accountability, but it's more just like you are who you are, and the system of cause and effect that has been built within the great wisdom of source is perfect. It's excellent at, in the long run, allowing us to face ourselves and to grow towards love. <br>That's what all this is about. This is all about growing who we really are towards love past fear. Processing fear is synonymous with the growing of love because our true nature is love. So, all we have to do is work through the crap that we're not, you see, and then what we really are is strengthened and empowered. That's really what we're doing. So, karma is just a long... It's just an energetic physics, you could say, that helps us to ultimately face ourselves and to grow towards love.<br><br><br>Sure. Did you ever meet the "Big Cheese" that Tom Campbell talks about? <br>Not to my knowledge, no. Not to my knowledge. Did you ever have an experience with source? Yes. So, in my pre-birth experience, at the beginning of this life, I attempted to reject it and fight my way out before I was even born because I was like, "I'm not doing this. This is freaking crazy. Low vibration, being physical. I don't like this. I'm not doing this." And I had similarly rejected a preceding incarnation attempt. <br>And so, yes, I remember... It's so beyond language, and it's so deep and so personal, but I remember the whole of all that is—the "I," the great "I AM"—coming to me and expanding me back out while I was still physical and showing me all of what I still am. Like, by being veiled, I hadn't lost all that I am. <br>That's what I was reacting in fear to. It was like I was terrified that I had lost all that I am, and source expanded me back out and said, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And that was the most holy moment of my life, and the level of love and understanding is impossible to describe—a billion times bigger than the wisest, most loving thing we can imagine on Earth. It's unspeakable.<br><br><br>Do you still feel that right now? <br>I do feel it, and I try not to look too deeply into it because it makes me very homesick. I don't want to do that. No, it's okay. I feel homesick every day a little bit, but no, it's very... It's like the most... It's like the most what we are. So, while we think of it here, there is a pining, like, if we really connect to it, there's a pining homesickness that is profound. That's why a lot of near-death experiencers, after they come back—not that they're suicidal at all—but they just want to go back. <br>They want to die so they can go back. Nothing... You know what I mean? It's not... That's why I'm so passionate about sharing this. It's like, we may have different experiences and have different stories, but underneath it all, we are all love and peace and joy, and that is the truth. That is the real good news, and we got to remind each other while we're here, man.<br>No, I agree. I agree. People hear that... I don't... We use "love" so much. I don't think people fully understand what you mean by that, you know what I mean? Like, we use the word "love," but do we fully conceptually understand what that... What you're talking about? Yeah, no, we don't. <br>Yeah, no, that's a really good point. You know, love is just like the word that we have because we got like five words in English for like all these things. You could put it this way: All things are one. And so, the celebration of the unity of being—the because the other is you—so, celebrating the other... There's an element of celebration that we often miss. <br>Celebrating the other is... I don't... The words are so bad. It's just this profound, natural, most normal state of celebration and bliss that's really what we are. You know, we're not actually separate. We're not actually the small "woe is me" story. That's not who we are. Who we are is all that is. We are everything that's ever existed and more—the substance of life itself. Life itself is beautiful. <br>How can you describe that with it? And love is just the word that we use because, you know, here, that's the emotion we can feel. You know, like, the Greeks had what—seven or eight types of love or something? You know, friendship love, familial love, societal love, love between soldiers, and all these different loves. We just got one word: "love." But that's just a way that we... When we really feel a celebration of the other and a love for the other, and we just feel connected with them, that's just the word we use. Imagine that amplified. Our connection is so... It's so real. I don't know how else to describe it. It's just...<br><br><br>Do you think we can interact with that source now? Oh, yes. Like, consciousness is fundamental in this reality, and I believe that source is that consciousness that arises in everything. So, how do you... Everything arises in the consciousness. There you go. There you go. How do you cultivate a more intimate relationship? We've kind of already touched on it actually because a move back towards what you really are is cultivating a relationship with it. Now, I know that it sounds like... <br>People might say, "Well, that's like focusing on yourself." Well, no. The local self is not who you are. Who you really are is the whole, and the individuated you... You're both. There's not a paradox. You're the precious individuated you, and you always will be the individuated you, but you're also one with the whole. So, it's like you're a drop in the ocean. I love the Rumi quote: "You are not just a drop in the ocean. You are the mighty ocean in the drop." <br>Oh, God, I love that. So, then, to your question: How do we retouch the ocean? Everything is occurring in the water already. So, it's a little bit like saying, "How do we find water?" And you're asking me while we're in water, while we're standing here in water, and it's made of water. It's just really deeply folded into some perception of not water. It's like the fish metaphor, right? Yeah, the fish metaphor. Right. Yeah, I'm that fish, buddy. I could tell you that.<br>I think it's so important, right? Like, I mean, it's just so important to understand conceptually what and how we... What we are, right? Like, how do we come here? Why do we come here? What is the purpose of this life as a human being, right? Is it the experience? Is it because you chose your life here? From what you... Your past interviews, your book... Like, you chose this life as a Christian. <br><br><br>What about the people that choose lives that aren't what we would term "good," you know what I mean? Like, bad guys—the villains. Like, do they choose those lives? <br>All lives are chosen, but the question... It's not fair to assume that a given fear-based egoic pattern is an automatic assumption of a life. That's not necessarily true. Rather, what we sign up for is a context and a set of constraints. And then, we want to see how well we can do in there. <br>Now, our set of constraints here are off the charts. Like, we've got a biology that will literally die if you don't feed it in a couple of weeks. You know, we've got an evolutionary history where we physically kill and eat the bodies of other beings. Like, it's crazy. It's normal for us, but it's wild. <br>We have all these constraints—linear time, discrete location, all the momentum of our society, and all the "us versus them" thinking, and all the fear that we've enshrined in our organizations and in our family customs, and all... Anyway, we've got this whole thing that we've created, and there's a ton of limitation that has the opportunity to provoke fear. We come into that seeking to process and grow in love. <br>Now, sometimes, sometimes we may choose to sign up for a certain role to help someone else experience something they need. Okay? But that's not the same as saying we came here to do evil or cause damage. So, it's a very fine line because, from the spiritual perspective, the higher vantage point is seen, and the opportunity is seen, and it's seen that love is the name of the game—not damage, not fear.<br>And even these contexts that we sign up for that are very challenging—like, you know, signing up to live in a war-torn country or a country that has no food, so where starvation is likely—that may seem crazy to the ego, to the local portion of the self that's like, "No, there's no way." But the thing is, the soul knows it is absolutely immortal and powerful, and that all contrast is an opportunity for growth. And it is the strong souls who say, "You know what? I want to challenge. <br>I want to really get under there and lift that heavy weight." So, it's a little bit metaphorically like saying there are different weights that you could lift on a weight bench. Some lives might be... <br>This is just a crude metaphor, so forgive the rudeness, but some lives might be 20 pounds. I mean, the context—the societal context, the body context, the likely outcomes—maybe that's 20 pounds. Another life might be 200 pounds. So, then, the question is like, "Why would you ever lay down on a weight bench and actually lift 200 pounds? Why would you do that?"<br>Well, because the greater the weight, the greater the counterpressure of the circumstance, the greater the opportunity for the consciousness to choose how to meet it and refine through it and utilize it in a way that is facilitating the processing of fear and the growth towards love. <br>Even just having an experience of great limitation or lack, you see, is a gift because now the soul knows what it's like to have that perspective. Like, how else can you know what it's like to be, for instance, hungry unless you're hungry? And then, forever after that, "Wow, now you know." And now, that is like a... <br>Okay, this is hard to describe, but when I, before I ever incarnated, I came across a being who had inspired me to incarnate because the quality of his being was so rich and so beautiful. And I felt how deeply he had been physically damaged in a life—in a certain lifetime, he had been physically wounded, and he had a pain that lasted with him for years, and it was very hard on his everything—his emotional body, his physical body. <br>Okay, imagine that like carving rock out of a mountain. Now, you've done this damage to the mountain. This is just a metaphor because we can't actually be damaged, but it feels like we're damaged here, right? We get pretty darn damaged here. It's like carving rock out of a mountain, but now that you've carved out that hole, that hole can now be filled. You see? <br>Now that there's a cavern that is empty, now, whether in this life through processing it or after this life when the constraints are released, one way or the other, spirit can't help but fully return to the fullness of its being and fully heal and fully process—fully fill that cavern. You see? And so, that is an incredible opportunity. So, that may seem crazy. It's not a process of masochism. It's a process of refinement of being through the integration of experience.<br><br><br>Was that like what you similarly described in your experience as the resting place—like, taking that moment to kind of, after a tough life, go back to a resting space to kind of take a break or maybe heal or just kind of regain your own awareness to what you really are? Yeah, there is great healing that takes place there that I can't speak much about. That resting place, but it is a layer of reality that we can rest in that helps facilitate a healing of the portion of the self. Yes.<br>So fascinating. There's a part in Robert Monroe's book where he talks about... I guess it's like the genesis of his story as an entity. He talks about AA and BB. I don't know if you've read that book at all. I'm not familiar. <br>Yeah, not so... It's like his first book talks about AA and BB, and they come, and they stumble upon Earth, and there are those beings or... Yeah, they're beings. Okay, they're not human beings. They're just beings. They stumble upon Earth, and they meet... I don't know if they meet a gatekeeper or something. Somehow, I'm trying to remember the book, and I'm paraphrasing a lot. <br>Somehow, they get interested in having an experience on Earth, and it's like, as soon as they have that one experience, they forget that they're that being, and they get lost in this, and they keep coming back and coming back and coming back and coming back. Yeah, yeah. So, there's a... <br><br><br>Okay, so we're never truly lost. It's really important to highlight, but if you imagine... Like, a planet is a planet, of course, but if you imagine it like a planet that has gravity, you get close enough to the gravity, and it tends to pull you in. And what that is—all that means is the denseness of form tends to be very stimulating. And so, because it's very stimulating... I don't mean to make it sound like, by the way, the higher realities aren't stimulating. They're ridiculously full of visual and audio and other sensory experiences. I just mean there's a density to the experience on Earth that is very rich and unparalleled. <br>And so, then, what happens is we get associated into it. That's the point of gravity—is we associate into the form. "I am just a human. I am just a salesman. I am just whatever this thing that we are." And so, then, when we step out of it, when the limitations are released, we still have an association. Like, the limitations may have dropped, but now, "Wow, I'm really in my mind space. I'm really associated with these thought forms." <br>And so, we tend to come back again to continue to process it. And part of what happens during awakening is we recognize, "You know what? That super dense form stuff doesn't actually satisfy. It doesn't actually make me deeply satisfied. It's not actually what I'm looking for." <br>And so, I love... There's a teaching that Rupert Spira, the non-duality teacher, has shared where he says something like, "You know, if you begin to awaken, and then you find that you're drawn into some physical thing again, go towards it. Go experience the thing that you feel will bring you the happiness. Go experience it all the way, and eventually—and you're not making this happen—but eventually, you will find it doesn't bring you happiness either. Maybe it's a new activity. Maybe it's a new relationship. Maybe it's a new drug." In the long run, it's not actually satisfying you. <br>So, I'm just saying that eventually, one way or the other, we end up discovering, "You know what? The world of form is not what we're seeking." And as we make that discovery experientially—I mean, it's in the mind, but it's also like the being learns this, so to speak—that is a reduction of the gravity of the planet. <br>You know, that's when you come out, and you're like, "Wow, I don't have the same association with that anymore." And that's part of what happens during awakening—as you rediscover who you really are, and you find, "Oh my gosh, the bliss of being is already there. I don't need any of this. I don't need objects. I don't need money. I don't need any of this." I mean, it's okay to use objects and use money and all that good stuff here in the play. You can fully participate in the play. It's just that you know that you're not the play character.<br>Wow. So, is this really like a dream? I mean, they keep saying that this reality is like a mind, right? Like, and... Is God sleeping, and we're just having... You know, 'cause when I go to sleep at night, I have... I feel like I'm standing on a floor that's solid. I'm... Well, depending upon if I'm lucid dreaming or not—I've only had one of those—but most of the time, I feel like everything's real. So, and this reality in the dream and right now, this feels like very real. So, ultimately, are we just dreaming, and we forgot? Yes, that's the short answer. <br>Yeah, it's very similar. It's just a different level. You know, like, it's like a fractal. Like, we fall asleep into the human experience, and then, as the human, we fall asleep into a dream experience. It's like fractals of forgetting in a form association. When you wake up, you find, "Oh, all of this was a dream." Now, it doesn't mean it wasn't important. It doesn't mean it wasn't meaningful. <br>In fact, we've assigned meaning to it. I might love that candle behind you. I love the color. I love what it is. Now, I have an appreciation for the form, the shape, the color, the heat maybe. And now, there's an existence there, even though my true nature transcends all form. You see, I don't have to be a candle. I don't have to experience a candle, but now I know a candle. Now, I can come back to my true nature, and it's like an expansion of all that is.<br><br><br>Is there an alarm clock? Like, is it going to wake us up? Like, when do we wake up from the dream? I guess... Do we become like... What is being lucid in this dream?<br>Yeah, being lucid in this dream is a move towards full alertness—not making anything up but not settling for thoughts, not settling for the meaning that you've put on the things. Try to look at the things around you and see them with a baby's eyes, for instance. You don't know what it is. It's just a shape. <br>Just like... Even just do an experiment. Just try, and you'll find how deeply you've associated meaning with everything around you. In fact, "A Course in Miracles" is a work that focuses on tangible exercises to train the self to move back towards alertness and towards who one really is and less... You know, move away from form association. <br>So, it may sound like an unsatisfactory answer to say we're moving towards a state of full alertness, but that is the direction because thinking is like a form of sleep. Associating with story and feeling and emotion is like a form of sleep. Moving towards full alertness and full... Like, totally objective... Totally, you're not making anything up. Look at your experience. Look at reality. Look at your consciousness itself. That tends to move us in the direction—like we talked about earlier—of who you really are. <br>And then, in my experience, it's not like then you go turn on the alarm clock. It's more like when you put down the crap, all of a sudden, you just wake up in bed without meaning to because now you put down the dream. Now, you'll fall right back asleep, you know, because the form here is real dense, but it doesn't matter. <br>Even a glimpse is enough to be like, "Oh my goodness, like, this is real." And that's what happened to me. Like, after a few months, I had this one experience. It was so freaking shocking. It was simple, but I started as a dream, and it was just a dream. And then, in this normal dream, I had this wave was going to come and crush me, and I told myself in the dream, "Okay, let yourself die. Let yourself let go of the physical body." <br>And then, all of a sudden, I was awake, but my body wasn't awake, and I was in the state of being where it sounded like someone parked a jet engine on either side of my head, and it was so freaking loud, and my whole body was vibrating more violently than I can even describe as possible. It was the most violent vibrations and the most loud sound. It was so loud and so stimulating—like vibrating, you know, so strong of vibration. I was stuck there for maybe 15 seconds, which is a long time when you're tied into a jet engine. <br>And then, and then my body woke up. I jumped out of bed. I was still the same level of alertness, but now I was in my room, and I was like, "What the hell was that?" Like, it was like... I was sweating. I was scared because it was not subtle. It was like, "Okay, you know, it was real." And so, that was just the very first taste, like, "Okay, there's a bigger picture going on here." You know, and then, so I just kept going down the path to investigate—like, just to be very objective, like, go basically be a scientist. Go look at your own consciousness just very scientifically. Don't make anything up. Just go explore.<br><br><br>Well, I've heard a lot of out-of-body experience books, and that sounds like to me a classical description of someone about to have an out-of-body experience. I mean, so have you had like a traditional... From what... I don't know what traditional is. Yeah, what traditional... Yeah, I've had one where I was walking around my house. So, that's kind of traditional. <br>In fact, in that experience, I didn't know I was out of body at first. It was so normal, and I was walking down my steps, and the light was just a little bit different, but it was totally normal. I was totally alert, totally lucid. It was a Saturday morning. I was getting up on a Saturday morning, right? And I'm halfway down my steps, and I'm like, "Am I in a body?" <br>So, I felt the carpet between my toes. I felt the crack in my wall. There's like these cracks and this paneling on my wall going down my steps. I felt the cracks, and I got to the bottom of my steps, and I concluded incorrectly that I was not out of body, and I felt foolish. I said, "I'm the only guy in my city walking around his house wondering if he's out of body." <br>Like, I felt like an idiot. But see, you have to have that mindset of like you're just always appraising reality in a very objective, open way, you know? But still, the light was just a little bit off, and I'm like, "All right, like, come on. All right, if I'm out of body, I'll walk through the wall." So, I walked through the wall, the front of my house, and I was in my front yard, and the sun was rising, and I was like, "Holy crap." <br>And as soon as I started thinking—like, I started analyzing—I woke up in my bed, but it was this same level of awareness. It wasn't like I woke up, and my bed was more real. No, I was like in my front yard, and then I was in my bed, and one was a non-physical body, and one was my physical body.<br>Wow, that's awesome. Have you experienced any more of those at all? I've had experiences that are in higher systems that are more colorful than I can possibly describe. So, I've had a couple of out-of-body experiences, and they say that there's other beings out there doing the same thing essentially—like, just, you know, kind of hanging out or traveling or experiencing. But then, like, there were some that noticed that you're out of body, and you may be a newbie at this, and they kind of mess with you a little bit—like, kind of... I don't know what... <br>You know, one person said like a clown kept showing up and trying to distract her, and she would go back into her body. Have you experienced anything like that? I have not experienced anything like that, but I'm aware that, like, Tom Campbell talks about that—how we often get fear tests when we first go out of body so we don't get anywhere we're not supposed to, you know? But I haven't really experienced that. I don't consider myself an adept out-of-body experiencer. It happens.<br><br><br>What about fear, though? Like, do you still make decisions today? Like, do you have fear in any of those decisions? <br>I still have fear. It's a lot different than before. I've processed a lot, but this is a highly constraining experience, so there's a lot of opportunities for fear. So, yeah, I still experience fear. Do you trust... Like, each... Do you trust source enough where your decisions—your decisions that you make—are like, "I feel a pull towards this. I know it's right in my heart. I trust that source or God is going to put me in the direction that I need to go, so I'm going to take that step"? <br>Like, kind of like Indiana Jones in the movie where he steps off the cliff, right? You know, like, yeah, can you still make those decisions and trust that God's going to show you the way? That's a great question. I'm getting better at that. I've come a long way, but I still have a ways to go just because I have fear, like I said. Sure. <br>So, I've taken certain steps in my life that were very difficult and took a lot of bravery. I've stepped down from previous jobs. You know, I even just sharing this experience the first time I shared it—it was like that, you know, took some courage because there was a lot of repercussions socially. My wife's parents are conservatively minded, and they have a Christian belief system that doesn't tolerate this kind of thing, so it caused some issues. <br>So, anyway, I feel like I've become more and more strong in being able to listen to that voice and follow that intuition and see it clearly because, you know, you got to be... If you're not willing to follow it, it's hard to see because the ego is going to obscure it super quick. So, that is something that I work on for sure. I think that's one of the main things that I am developing, yeah, personally.<br><br><br>Beautiful, beautiful. I don't know if I can... I think that's it, man. I think we dropped the mic. I think we're done. Christian, how can people find you? How can they connect? Yeah, so I have a website: awalkinthephysical.com. My book is available to be read for free on the website at the third link down on the book page. It's not about money. I just want to get the message out there. It is available in print, Kindle, and Audible. In the audio copy, I get a lot of emails, but I'm happy to try to respond to emails if anybody would like to reach out.

What a great pleasure it is to see everyone. I hope everybody's getting ready for the big Thanksgiving holiday that's coming up. I know I'm certainly not ready for it. Time's going by way too quickly. But before I introduce our guest of honor today, I just want to point out a couple of quick housekeeping things.<br>If you're joining us on Meetup, part of our value proposition is that you get to ask our guest speaker a question in real time. If you want to remain anonymous, you can protect your privacy by essentially just writing your question in the chat. Or if you'd like to just ask the question directly, you can raise your hand. Those of you who are joining us here in person today, there are a couple of places where you can ask a question. You can write it out, you can bring it to me, or you can actually come to the mic and ask Christian directly.<br>So I just wanted to point those things out. We are recording this, and so without further ado, I would love to introduce our guest today. We are going to be speaking with Christian Sundberg. I had the great pleasure of meeting Christian at the IANDS 2023 conference last year in the Washington DC area, which is in our backyard. His experience, his testimony, is mind-blowing. It's different from many NDEs, and there's a tremendous amount of value to be gained from it. So I am thrilled that he agreed to speak with us today.<br>Christian had pre-birth memories, and that's what he's going to be talking to us about today. However, those pre-birth memories seemed to sort of leave his consciousness during early adulthood, but they came back about 13 years ago. I think it's since then that he's really started to talk in public about the experience. He's written a wonderful book called "A Walk in the Physical," which attempts to describe the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love on our own human journey.<br>So he'll be talking with us for up to an hour, hour and a half, as long as he wants, and then the last 30 minutes or so we will invite the audience to ask questions. I hope you will avail yourself of that opportunity because it doesn't happen very often. So without further ado, it's my very, very great pleasure to introduce Christian this afternoon to us all. So take it away, Christian. Welcome.<br><br><br>Thank you so much, Angie. It's great seeing you again. Several familiar faces. It's beautiful. Good. So thank you for the opportunity. As Angie said, I'll share my story again. I like that you said it's not really a story; it's an experience. Well, I was just talking to my group here a few moments ago, and it is—I didn't want to say story because somehow that diminishes what you went through. It's an experience, but it's also your own personal testimony. Yes, lived, right? Yes, definitely. And yes, so I'm happy to try to share that. I'll jump right in.<br>But before I do, I just have to disclaim, as I do every time I try to share this, that language just can't possibly do this justice. You know, because our true nature transcends the world of form. It's bigger than all of this context. It transcends linear time and discrete location and all these things that seem to be so fundamentally real for us. It's actually deeper than that. So our language is just vastly not sufficient. In fact, when I first really had this memory return and was having out-of-body experiences, I felt, "Oh my gosh, I really want to communicate this." But I also wondered, "Can I? Should I even try?" Because like writing one sentence, no matter what words you use, it's just wrong. It's just like blasphemy or something to try to put language on this. So I just have to say that first. I'm going to, of course, use language; that's what we have. But it's very difficult to articulate this.<br><br><br>Okay, so my body is 44 years old right now. When I was a young child, up until the age of five or six, I had some pre-birth memory. So I remember choosing this life and incarnating. I assumed everybody knew we weren't from here, but nobody else talked about it, so I didn't talk about it either. And then that memory left me completely by the age of five or six, and I had no memory of it at all until the age of 30.<br>I took up a long-term meditation practice, and after several months, I began to have out-of-body experiences that were extremely eye-opening—not subtle, very, very paradigm-challenging experiences. And at that same time, pre-birth memory began to return. It wasn't like a big epiphany; it was just like, there it was. It was so obvious. It was obvious that I'm not the human; I'm just experiencing this, playing through the character, so to speak.<br>So, you know, at first when that came back, I didn't share it for a while. In fact, I didn't share it at all for about eight years because I've been a working professional, and it's the kind of thing you don't talk about. You know, I'm a normal person, I'm down to earth, I'm a pretty logical person, and you know, this is the kind of thing that you get some flak for sharing. But about six years ago, I just really felt intuitively that the ground was just fertile enough, so to speak, in consciousness space here on Earth, that sharing could be helpful. And also, I was receiving these intuitive chunks of—I don't know how to describe this—but like chunks of information that I knew were to be eventually a book. And so that book is now out and available.<br>So, you know, I have shared now, and I'm happy to share again. I don't think that my personal testimony is the most important thing to share, so I will share it because I've been told it provides valuable context for why I'm saying what I say. I understand that, but what's far more important than my own testimony is like, what are we all of us? What are we really doing here? What is the human experience? You know, that's what I'm passionate about. And why is love so important? And why do we have nothing to fear? You know, those are the really important themes, I think. So I'm going to come back to that in just a moment.<br>So okay, I know this sounds strange. I'm going to dive right in, and I know this sounds wild, but I remember before I had ever physically incarnated, coming across a being who had—okay, so in the higher systems, communication is not words; it's telepathic. There's an exchange, sharing of knowing because while we are individuated, we are also a part of each other, a part of the whole. We're connected. And so I felt from him this incredible love and power and freedom, and it was so amazing. And I was like, "Oh my gosh, how? And I asked him telepathically, "How did you do this? How are you this? How do you feel as much freedom and joy and love and power as I feel that you feel?" And he shared with me many things, but chief among them that he had lived a physical life, and in the physical life, he had a long-term pain, a health condition that lasted with him for many years. And that pain, the way that he chose to meet it, allowed a certain refinement or deepening of his being. You know, there was like his essence was deeper because he knew that and he experienced it and did not reject it and really chose love even in and through that context. There was this incredible deepening of the experience.<br>And I was so inspired, and I was like, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I want to do that." You know, and he at first shared something like—and this is not negative—something like, "Yeah, that's what they all say," like not blowing me off, but it's just like, "You just don't know. You just don't know what you're asking for. It's harder than what you could even understand right now." And I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do it." And he said, "Okay, we'll go talk to your guides."<br><br><br>Okay, so I don't have right after that the major—but the I found him later after I had lived many times. He was encouraging to me, but the majority of my pre-birth memories are of a time somewhat immediately preceding this life and the life just before this. Actually, I was in this waiting area. Okay, how do I describe this? So first, I was in like a realm of what I can only describe as living golden light, where I could move anywhere at a whim with an intention, and I was connected to all things. And this guide was coming to me over and over and asking me, "Are you ready to go back yet?" Like every once in a while, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And saying, "No, I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready yet." Not pestering me, but just like reminding me of my own intention, like I was on this journey, and I was just like taking it—felt like taking a long break, you know, or being on a very long, very long weekend or something. You know, it felt very long.<br>And eventually, when he came to me saying, "Okay, I'm ready," you know, and then I reviewed with him what I can only describe as my state—like who I am, who I've been, what I knew, what I understood. This is so hard to describe too, but metaphorically, just as a metaphor, it was like if you looked at a graph with hundreds and hundreds of lines or something, I could see this one line was really, really low, and I could—it was so obvious. I mean, it's not literally like that; it's energetic. It's an energetic review of the being, the qualities of being, and what you understood and who you are. <br><br><br>And I could see this one area, this very specific low vibration fear that had bested me in a previous experience. So in a previous life, this fear had overcome me, and fear gives rise to ego, you know, which is very damaging, painful for oneself and others. And so in that life, I had become an egoic monster, and I'd hurt many other people. And so I could see, "Oh man, it was obvious that that would be the most useful, like that would be the most helpful and powerful if I could integrate that fear, really heal it, really process it." <br>But I could see it was so low vibration, like it was so, so, so extremely low that I remember asking, "Can it even be done? You know, has any being in creation ever processed a fear that's this low in this specific way?" And I was told, "Yes, and you have all of time available to you to do so. There's no hurry." And so I just knew—this sounds strange to me now as a human, but at the time, I just knew like, "Well, if it can be done, I will do it. Like if it's possible, I will do it." Like I was—I just because I knew what we are, what I am, like I knew I was a very powerful, immortal being. Like I knew, "Oh, if it's possible, I'll do it. I'll do it."<br>So they brought me a life that was appropriate for that intention, and it wasn't this life. It was a life—basically, time is strange to articulate, but it was basically immediately preceding this life. And I reviewed that life in great detail, and I remember accepting that life. And then I remember accepting the veil. Okay, so the veil is just a term we use for the constraints that we wear in consciousness on and in consciousness in order to have the very defined, limited human experience. And so, in simple terms, the way we could put that is the veil is a forgetting. You know, that's a part of it. We forget all the rest of what we are, but it's not just a forgetting. It also feels like you're disconnected from everything else because one thing that makes our reality very unique is it is a very high degree of separation. The experience of separation is profound here. We really feel separate from each other here. That's a very unique and alien context, actually.<br>So when I accepted the veil, I remember that my—this plummet of vibration, the vibration of my being from being connected to all things, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. And then it felt like when you're at the bottom, you think you can get out, it goes lower, and then it goes lower more, and then it goes lower, lower, lower, and then more low. It was ridiculous. It was so, so low. It was like jumping out of an airplane or something. I don't know, but you never hit the ground; you just keep falling. <br>And then being finally arriving in the womb, I was in the fetus of the body that was to be mine, and I was like, "I am not doing this. There is no freaking way." Like I had so much fear rise up in me because it was so dark, it was so dense, it was so constraining. I'm like, "There is no way I'm going to tolerate this for a lifetime." So I summoned my might, my strength. I knew what the strength that I had, that we have, and I fought the veil. I fought my way back out, and I was successful in doing that because I returned to the other side. But I saw I had a life review, and I could see that I had killed the fetus that was to be my body. So just like a life review described by your death experiencers, I could see from—so the mother was the primary because I had heaped grief on the mother by causing a miscarriage. But then because the mother's journey was more difficult because now she had all this grief, I could see hundreds of other people whose journeys would all be made more difficult because of my fear.<br><br><br>So, you know, and from that—this is hard to talk about because from that point of view, you know, like it's okay, like you can't really fail, there's nothing really wrong, you know. But I could see very objectively like, "Oh man, I have a lot of fear. Like I got to do something about this." You know, so I actually spent some time in a place that I call—and I know this sounds crazy—but I actually have heard one other person call it the same, and she told me she's experienced the same place, and she gave me details that I've never shared, and I was like, "It's super cool." But what I called it is like a veil acceptance simulator. So I went to a place in the non-physical where you can practice surrendering your control to a veil and not fighting it. And so it was like being in a dark pool, like a huge dark swimming pool, and they dunk you under the water, and then they keep you under the water, and then it's all like a low vibration, but it's an artificial low vibration. And then you can cry uncle, you know, they'll let you out. You can be like, "I've had enough," you know, and they'd let you out just to practice. And I can tell you that the real veil is a lot harder; it's a lot more vibrationally extreme.<br>Anyway, eventually, they brought me this life because I still had this intention, and so I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail. And it was like if you take a tree and lay it on its side and you start at the thick part and work your way out to the branches, I could see and feel and experience millions and millions and millions and millions of possibilities of what this life might be, all at once, all in like a second. And it wasn't just actions and events; it was more like, "What would it be like to be me?" You know, like, "What would it feel like to be Christian?" You know, and I could see that in my early 20s, it would—because I knew this biology has limitations that other biologies don't, and it would make day-to-day experience very challenging. And I could see that in my early 20s, it would be likely that I would be crushed by a health trauma. And that did happen when I was 22.<br><br><br>I was in Chongqing, China. I had studied in Beijing in college. I tried to move to China after college. This is just the physical manifestation of it. And I was teaching English in Chongqing, China. I had a heat stroke. I was in a Chinese hospital for four days. They gave me bag after bag after bag of potassium, and something about that burned out my nervous system. And I experienced neurological pain that would not go away for months. It was absolutely horrible. It was agony, just pain, just constant pain that I could not escape. And my body didn't sweat for a year. And I would just get sick anytime my temperature rose. I would just get terribly sick. So I was stuck in a Chinese hotel room where the power was going off. And this—it was 110 degrees in this hotel in this city. And so when the air conditioning went off, the temperature would rise, and so my room would start getting really hot, and I would just get sick. And so I had no control over it. You know, it was just a week of heat, you know, getting exposed to heat, getting exposed to heat, getting exposed to heat after already having been in the hospital for four days. And I just knew after four days like something they were giving me was making me a lot worse, so I did not want to go back.<br>Anyway, I had some post-traumatic stress from that. I ended up blotting out that whole experience, and in my 20s, I had no memory of it. And actually, no memory of up until the age of 22. I had only a little bit of memory of it, not full memory of it, because it was so painful to think back on. And I went through years of EMDR therapy—it's a type of psychotherapy—to process that fear. And I did. It took like hundreds of sessions actually to get down through all the ego layers and really find there was a moment in a hospital bed in Chongqing, China, where I perceived—because this is what fear is about, buying into a perception that's not the truth—I perceived, "I am absolutely powerless to escape agony." And it was such a low vibration that I—it was the fear, you know, it was a manifestation of this fear that I came to process, which now I know. At the time, I did not know that. And it took a heck of a lot of emotional work to really allow and feel all these layers of fear all the way down to this root and to really process it.<br><br><br>Anyway, so that's a bit of the story. You know, after, of course, I was born, but pre-life, I could see that it was likely that a health event would happen and that I would probably be crushed, and it would give me the chance to re-experience this fear. See, not so—that sounds like masochism or something, right? But it's not. You know, I could because I was actually super, super excited at the opportunity, even though like I knew this was going to be harder in a way than I had ever done before. I also could see the absolutely incredible opportunity. This is the thing I really want to lift up about the contrast that we sign up for as humans. It is so preciously powerful. It's like winning the lottery. In fact, I felt like I had been given a winning lottery ticket just to be given the chance to play a human. It really felt like all that is could see—and these words are poor, okay, but like it could see that it would be profitable, so to speak, for me to play this human. Like, "Wow, you know, what an honor."<br>Anyway, so I reviewed this life in incredible detail. I asked lots of questions about it, mostly in terms of like things I wanted to experience or not, but primarily it was like traits. Like I knew that I wanted to be intelligent again because I had been intelligent in previous experiences, and I preferred that. And they said, "Yes, that's okay. You'll be—you can be intelligent." And I asked to have a small, tiny bit of memory. I said, "I don't want to forget everything this time." And they said, "You can do that, but it will make the journey more difficult." And I knew why. I could feel because the level of contrast would be even higher because having some awareness of home provokes an incredibly painful homesickness. You know, it's like near-death experiencers often describe, like once they come back, they do not want to be here anymore. Like, "Why do I—why would I want to be here when that is so wonderful? Like why?" It's like that, you know.<br><br><br>Okay, so then I remember there being a moment to say yes, and I don't remember that moment, but I do remember being in this like waiting area place where this guide suddenly came and grabbed my attention like, "Go now." And then I'm being like, "Okay, now." And then being in this room—the words are so bad. I mean, I say it's a room, but it was like a—it looked like a station almost above the Earth, like a mechanic shop maybe above the Earth, and below me was the Earth. <br>And there was a shaft in the floor, and I could see the Earth, and there were these beings in this room that I can only describe as veil application technicians. So like they're very technical in nature, and they are extremely skilled at matching the veil to the soul. You know, because each individual soul is so unique and so powerful in so many ways, and each life has its own energetic thing going on. The body has its own energetic thing going on. The culture, the world—you know, Earth is not the only place we can incarnate. So it's like all that together is like an energetic picture, and they do this like meshing so to prepare the veil and to make it effective, you know, to as effective as possible.<br>And they asked me one last time, "Are you sure?" And I said, "Yes." And I knew that once I said yes here, it was like getting strapped into the roller coaster. You know, there's like no way to get off once you get in. So then I felt the plummet in my vibration again, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more. Like I cannot stress the ridiculous drop in vibration down into the cold, dense, dark, separated state of being in the womb, physical, and feeling like all of my knowledge had disappeared and all of my connectedness had disappeared, and I felt like I had lost all that I am. That's how it felt.<br>And I sent one message back to the technicians, "Did it take? You know, did the veil take?" And they sent one message back, "Yes." And actually, I felt accomplished at that moment because I knew that even making it to the physical was a huge accomplishment because it's such a vibrational step to come down here. So then I was there for a little while, and I was like, "I'm not doing this. This is not happening. There's just no way." Like and once again, I was like, "I'm not doing a life of this. This is not happening. This is ridiculous. Like I'm just—there's no way I'm doing a life of this." So once again, I began to summon my might to fight my way out.<br><br><br>And when I did that, the most holy moment of my entire human life happened. This is very—this is impossible to describe. I felt my being being expanded back out all the way, and I felt all of the universe within me, and I felt the sun of Earth within me, and it was churning with bliss. And God said to me—God, the Great I Am of all things that I was a part of—said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." Oh, sorry. I try to not get choked up every time I tell this story, but it's like so personal. Pretty choked up myself, actually. It feels like every time I tell this, it feels like I just pulled down my pants. Like that's—I'm serious. Like that's how this feels. This is like the most personal moment in my whole journey. Like it is holy. It is holy. It's very, very powerful. It's holy.<br>And oh my gosh, yeah. But the thing is for us to know that that while we're here, you know, that's powerful. So we got to remind each other. Anyway, so I stopped fighting because I knew, "Oh, if that's what I am, and I haven't lost everything I am, I don't need to be afraid. I don't need to fight." Okay, oh, that's wonderful, you know. So I let go and returned to being in the womb, and I felt like I was there for a long time.<br>And then I remember the day I was born. I remember the sight and the sound and the touching and the cold and the pain. I remember being cut—circumcision. I remember looking at the nurses and being like, "Who are these beings? What is happening?" Like I had no idea what was happening. I just knew something really intense was happening, and it was just really intense, and I was super curious. And it's funny because later when I told this to my father, he said, "You had the most curious look on your face I've ever seen the moment you were born." <br>He said, "You were just staring at everything with the most intense curiosity I've ever seen." I remember that. I remember being so curious like, "What is happening?" And I didn't know any—I didn't understand anything at all. I understood nothing. I just knew that there were these beings, and they were somehow doing something to me, for me. I felt love for the nurses. I felt love for my mother. I felt love for the doctor. I felt—I just felt so much love. It was just normal because love is what we are. Like yeah, of course.<br>Anyway, so and then later in my life, I drew the room from my memory because I know that they say babies can't see, so I don't know how I saw this. Maybe it was a non-physical sight or something. I don't know, but I could see the room, the layout, and I drew it for her later. This is where the bed was. This is where the heating grate was. This is where the doctor was standing, you know. And she confirmed, at least you know, for me that that was true. That was correct.<br><br><br>So then as I aged, you know, I used to draw upon the flowchart memory and try to like cheat a little bit, like just to try to see like what's going to happen. Like I remember like just when you're a little kid, like just simple things like, "Is anyone going to come over to the house tomorrow?" And then I would just look and see, you know, and I would just be curious. But I also assumed that certain aspects of the higher realities would be true here. Like for instance, I assumed we would be able to feel each other's emotions here because in higher systems, we telepathically share all that we are all the time. We feel what each other is feeling. There's no shame in it. You just feel what we feel each other all the time. It's just the most—it's so normal.<br>And this one time, I remember dancing to a record. I was in my diapers. I remember being in diapers, standing at the edge of the couch at this original house where I grew up, and there was this neighbor friend over. And I remember telling her, "Watch me dance," and then standing there listening to this record player, this music, and shaking my little butt, and she just walked away unimpressed. And I realized, "She can't feel what I'm feeling. What the heck is this place?" Like I remember that being the moment when it dawned on me like, "Where the heck am I?"<br>Anyway, like so I feel like I've never really fully come to terms with the strangeness of Earth. You know, like another assumption I had was people in positions of authority or leadership would be loving and wise because love and wisdom is the authoritative power, you know. But on Earth, we—that's not always the case.<br>Okay, so that's a quick sharing of my experience. So what I want—what was more important though is like what are we, and what are we doing here? You know, okay, there's no good language for this, but I'm just going to jump right in because I like getting to the root. There's so many layers of stuff that we build on top of the root, you know, but the root is the most important.<br><br><br>Okay, so what are we? First of all, we are consciousness itself, spirit itself. So we are not the form. So that means we're not the objects; we're not the body; we're not the thoughts. So in my case, during my awakening, it wasn't that this knowing that I just shared came back as some new set of forms. It was more that I went and got in touch without any expectation at all with what I really am, which is awareness itself beneath thought. I went and I looked very deeply at my own consciousness beneath thought, and as I did that, other parts of myself just rose up because I was no longer staring at the movie screen—that's a metaphor of the human life. <br>I was no longer staring at my story of Christian and Christian's problems and Christian's job and all the things that I think I thought were me. I really investigated what I really am, which is awareness itself. So that's what we are. We are awareness itself, consciousness itself. That consciousness itself can't be named actually because it is the stuff that transcends all form. So all form arises within it; all form is made of it. But the closest words we have is it is love and peace and freedom and joy endlessly, forever, amen. Like that is our nature. That is what we are. We're made of the stuff where love and peace and freedom and joy are the closest words we have for what that stuff is. We are the knowing quality of that which knows things, you know.<br>And so we are individuated souls but also one with the whole. So what I mean is we are both individuated people, individuated souls, beings—that means you're you, but you're also one with the whole. And those two things are not mutually exclusive. That's something we really get confused about on Earth. We think, "Well, if I'm separate, if I'm not—we think if I'm not separate, I must lose my individuation. I must lose who I am." No, no. You are you. You are precious. You are it. It's just that precious you is also one with the ocean. <br>So I love the Rumi quote, "You are not just a drop in the ocean; you are the mighty ocean in the drop." I love that. And Wayne Dyer says something similar to that, like, "You are not—trying to think of the exact phrase—I have it in my book—something like, 'You are a piece of God, and you are all together God, and God is you.'" This is not blasphemy; this is your identity. Of course, because in Christian theological terms, that's like the heresy of saying that you're God. I don't mean you are God the whole; I mean you are a precious piece of the whole, and you're a drop in the ocean, and you're irreplaceable.<br>Okay, so as individuated drops of the ocean, we have the opportunity to make free will choices, you know. And we might choose to engage contrast sets, experience sets of limitation, physical systems. Okay, so the physical universe is like a very dense, very high constraint simulation that is built for the purposes of the expansion of what we are, the deepening of what we are. Okay, so I know that sounds like—how does that work? So I'm going to try to describe that. There's really two primary things we're doing here in the physical to fulfill its purpose.<br>Okay, one is we are integrating experience. So what I mean is we have experience, and then we go, "Huh, wow, I get that now. I now know what it's like to be hungry or to be cold or to be happy or to be a mother, to be a human, to look at the sky, to appreciate sunset and post-sunset." You know, we come to experience all of what's offered on Earth, not just the objects and the sensory experience of the Earth but our perspectives of it and the meaning that we put on it. So if we decide, "This sucks," then we experience this sucks, and then we have to integrate that. You see, we learn by—it's a learning of the being by being something. <br>So because people often say, "Well, what's the point if we forget every time? What's the point of learning if we forget?" This is not intellectual learning. I mean, intellectual learning happens, and it's valuable, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about a learning of the being by being something, by actually going and being it. Actually, like if you want to know what it's like to be human, you got to be human. You can't be the whole, you know. If you're the whole, you're the whole. You know, if you feel the sun in you, you feel the sun in you. But if you want to wake up and have a headache and figure out how do I go to work, pay the bills, and you know, pull through the drive-thru and order my coffee or whatever, then that's what you are, you know. So the veil just permits us for that deep immersion so that we integrate an experience of this depth.<br>Okay, so that's the first thing: integration of experience, meaning we constantly process it and bring it into kind of what we are. And it's not just this lifetime; it's all the experiences we've had because, by the way, other lifetimes is not other people; it's you. It's just you doing one thing and then doing another thing and then doing another thing and then doing another thing. And you learn by being this and then by being this and then by being this and then by being that.<br>Okay, and the second main thing we're here to do is to wield a loving intention rather than a fear-based, egoic intention. So to wield a high quality of intention through our choice-making, that means to make choices that are in alignment with love and not fear—fear being based in negative perceptions that are actually not even true because fear is, "Oh, I perceive I'm powerless." <br>But look, the ego comes to the rescue and says, "You're not powerless because look, you can—I don't know—hurt the person next to you. Don't you feel powerful now for five seconds or five minutes or five years?" That doesn't work. It may temporarily seem like it's an itch that's been scratched, but the ego's solutions don't actually work. They're based in fear. So can we choose love and peace and freedom and joy rather than the ego patterns and the fear? Can we face our fear? You know, can we face our rejection?<br>When we choose love here, we allow our true nature to shine more brightly into this very dense place, and then there's an expansion of love through us, in us, of us, and in this place. And that is beautiful. So both of those things serve the expansion of love because beingness is what we are, and beingness is love. So when beingness integrates experience, it ends up being a deepening of what is possible. And when beingness chooses love over fear and processes out fear, heals it, really evolves the quality of its intention towards love, then love has expanded through that in that.<br>Okay, so I know those are like—they may sound a little abstract, but I try to make it a little more specific. Okay, so this refinement of being that I'm trying to describe—what is it a refinement of? So okay, so first of all, let's say that you've never known—ever—that you've never known what it's like to be cold, ever. Like you've never been cold. Let's say you start in a place that there's no such thing as cold. Well, how do you know what cold is or what warmth is unless you actually come and experience it? You have to become something you're not in order to deepen the depths of what you truly are because there's nothing like—you could say duality itself is like a cave that has been carved out into which beingness can then process and learn and grow through its experience and through its integration.<br>So as a simple—another example, maybe not simple, but a specific example, let's say that you know, like in my case, the fear I've been here to—I'm here to process is like a powerlessness, like I'm powerless to escape pain. Okay, so I have deeply, deeply, deeply experienced the perception of powerlessness. But how much deeper can I know—can we know forever—what it's like to truly be free and powerful and expanded than to know it and then really integrate it? You see, it creates a space into which now I know what freedom truly is and how free I truly am.<br>Okay, so duality itself isn't even fundamentally real. It's like a tool; it's like a creative tool, you know. Okay, so as the substance of beingness refines, it's a refinement in what it knows, so what it understands, and it's an expansion in what it can feel because now you can feel things that maybe even before you weren't even capable of feeling. And it's an expansion of what you can do. So for the last one, what do you mean an expansion of what I can do? Okay, most realities are thought-responsive, which means they respond to the intention and the thought form of the individual. So here on Earth, if you're doing something super hard or maybe you're having a super rough week, and if someone flicks you off on the street, you know, and you could be angry or you can choose to allow the egoic rise that says, "You're powerless. <br>This makes me mad." You know, if you can really—how do you deal with that in that day when you have a headache or you have no money today or something, and you're not in a great mood or something? You know, like how, under those constraints, how do you respond? What quality of intention do you bring forth? <br>When we can bring forth a high quality of intention when the constraints are high, which on Earth they often are through illness or persistent circumstance or whatever, if we can do that here, then when we go to a thought-responsive reality, we can wield intention that is so strong because we've done it with the weight on us that's much heavier. So metaphorically, it's like if you lift 500 pounds even if you push it up only a few inches, man, you know, and you do that for a few decades, then you go to a thought-responsive reality where someone hands you one pound, you can chuck that thing down the street. It's nothing to you because you lifted 500. And then they say, "Oh my gosh, how did you do that?"<br>And you're like, "Dude, this is nothing. This is nothing. You should see it on Earth where like this density is in your face. It's persistent; it doesn't let up." See, because through it, so it's to what refines is our ability to—you could say wield virtue. Even—I'm careful to use the word virtue, but to make it specific, like wield bravery, choose bravery, and wield bravery, or choose freedom even when you don't see freedom, you know, or choose love even when it's not easy, you know. <br>That allows a deepening of what we can do in those higher systems, and then we get to keep that. You know, so when the life ends, you don't keep your money; you don't keep your body; you don't keep your declining eyesight, you know. You don't keep any of that. That's not you; it's just a form you wore. It's like taking off a costume when you get off stage on a high school play. You're not worried about taking off your costume. You get off, and you're back to being your fuller self, but now you know what it's like to have been in the play. And here, now we get to keep that quality of intention, and we get to keep that refinement that we underwent. You could say the substance of spirit itself has refined through how it responded to the circumstances of life.<br><br><br>Okay, so now a few metaphors for that—just three metaphors. The first is a simple metaphor of refining gold. So you know, when gold is just mined, it's just full of imperfection. So Tom Campbell talks about that in terms of what he calls entropy, which just means lack of order or yet unevolved. I like to use the word fear as synonymous with yet unevolved, you know, where we have fear, it's just because in that level of constraint, we just haven't evolved enough yet to not respond in an egoic way. That's okay, but that's—you know, Earth is hard, you know. But through the application into this circumstance set, we have to make—we're forced to make choices under this constraint, and that being forced to have to make choices is like a refining of the substance of spirit. And then when the constraints are lifted, the refinement remains. Okay, so it's like refining gold. That's the first one.<br>The second one is like exercise—a simple example. Like I've used this metaphor many times. People say, "Well, why would I ever leave the bliss of the higher realms to come out here to this hellhole? Why would I ever do that? You know, that doesn't make any sense. Screw that. I don't like this world." Okay, so metaphorically, if you're on your couch and you're watching TV, and you got all access to the snacks and the food, and you feel great, and everything's comfortable, let's say you can do that as much as you want forever, you know, forever. <br>Why would you ever get off the couch, get up off the couch, and go for a run? Like why would you ever do that? Like why would you put yourself under stress and pain because the run can hurt, especially when you haven't run in a while? You know, that hurts. It doesn't feel good at you know, but it allows a vibrancy. It's a deepening of what your body can—it's like using the counter-pressure of the run to deepen your health. And then when you come back to the couch, even after a few days when your body has adjusted, and you're like, "Wow, I'm stronger now," you can actually appreciate the couch in a way that you never could before.<br>You know, like then when you sit down and watch the TV, it actually is more enjoyable because now, "Oh, okay, I've been for a run," and your body is stronger, and you're—you know what I mean? So incarnating is kind of like that. It's like signing up for something that can be incredibly challenging at the time, but it can be so potent in the growth that's possible.<br>Okay, and the last metaphor—and I used this during the last IANDS conference briefly, and I don't know if this stuck, and this is really specific, so if this doesn't help, I apologize, but I'm just going to try because I've been trying for years trying to think of metaphors that can describe this—but imagine if you take a rubber band and you stretch it out like really wide, and then you lock it into that position. So now it's in a really unnatural stretched-out state, right? It doesn't like it because it's all stretched out. But while the rubber band is stretched out, now take a pen and draw on the rubber band like draw an image like trees or mountains or something or letters—say you're writing some words on the rubber band. <br>When you let go of the rubber band and return it to its original position, you have now created a refinement of writing that was only possible because you did it while it was stretched out. Do you know what I mean? Like if you put it back to its original size, now you got these perfect tiny little letters and these perfect tiny little trees or whatever. They're perfect. You could not have drawn them if you hadn't stretched it out. You couldn't have done it. But now that you return it back to its original shape, now the rubber band gets to keep that. Yeah, I mean, I know that's kind of a crude metaphor, but I can't think of better ways to try to articulate this.<br><br><br>Okay, so now how do we as humans cooperate? Like how do we participate in a way that helps facilitate what we're doing here? Now, that's a very personal question, and it's unique for each individual. And I will never try to say, "Oh, just do this," or "This is what you have to do." You know, you know more than anybody external can say to you. Your own intuition knows; your own soul knows. You know, like trust yourself. Your intuition knows the best way that you might be called in this life to live or what to do or who to be, you know, or what challenge to face. But I'll just lift up three like kind of broad themes that seem to be reoccurring, and they're very important.<br>Okay, the first is to seek to wield a genuine intention that is aligned with love rather than fear. And love means a lot of things, but fear can mean a lot of things too. So you notice I didn't say do this action and not that action. No, because the qualities of love and fear, they precede a given action, and they shine through a given action. They even shine through a given thought. Okay, they precede—like in the physical, we tend to think this action is good; this action is bad. Now, it's simple; I get it. But the thing is, what's important is the real why you're doing what you're doing—the real why, not what necessarily your ego is telling you. <br>Can you genuinely choose compassion, kindness, understanding, peace genuinely, whatever that means? And also, it's not about the size; it's not about the scope of like you know, like you have to affect a thousand people today. No, it's about quality—quality over quantity. You could be by yourself in your house, no one, you don't see anybody, but if you face your own fear, that's—that's the next one. If you face your own fear even in the quiet of your bedroom, you are helping the entire collective consciousness of humanity.<br><br><br>So that's the second one: face your fear and own your crap. Like we all have some crap going on, you know, ego crap, and you know, all the stuff we run from and all the ways we don't want to own our own place in the world. Try to own it. Try to choose to own it and face your fear. When you feel afraid, it's okay, man. It's okay if you're afraid. The first step to processing is to acknowledge, "I am terrified of this certain thing, this certain outcome, this certain whatever, this certain perception." You know, like I've heard people say, "I'm terrified of public speaking." I don't personally have that fear. <br>Once you know who you truly are, how can talking—how—no, no one's—this isn't me anyway. Someone's going to judge my face or my words; it doesn't affect me. But if you think my identity, "I will be seen. I could be seen in a way that will make me look foolish," that might trigger the fear, "Oh, I actually feel foolish," or "I actually feel shameful, unworthy of love." That's one of the really big themes that's running around on Earth right now. So that's why you don't want to public speak, you know, because you don't want the situation to trigger or prove to you that negative fear that's down there. Okay, acknowledge, "I am afraid of that." That's okay to see it and look at it clearly.<br>Now, we often can't do that in a given moment all the way to the root because the ego is super good at covering up our deepest fears with hundreds of layers of crap. But what we can do is meet this present moment. And what I mean is like find out what in your body—where is something negative occurring in your body right now? Or where is there an idea that keeps coming up today that's bothering you? Okay, go look at it. Why? Well, because this thing is proving to me that I don't have power. Okay, okay, go look at it. Go feel into it. Explore it. <br>Don't reject it automatically. You're actually applying the meaning to that by the way, but I'm not even pointing at that right now. I'm just saying be willing to face the fear. And then when the fear arises, it's okay if you feel afraid. What choice do you make then? You know, I remember before one of the surgeries I had, I remember being in an anesthesiologist's office, and there was a sign there that said, "Courage is not not being afraid; courage is moving forward anyway." Absolutely. Absolutely. It's okay if you're afraid. What do you do then? That's how you see—that's how you—that's what matters.<br><br><br>I love the phrase from Bashar, "Circumstances don't matter; only state of being matters." That's so powerful. Okay, and then the third general suggestion is be authentic. Okay, so why—why does authenticity—how does authenticity align with integrating experience and choosing love over fear and being a loving person? Because your true nature is love underneath all the crap. You can't fool spirit; you can't fool God. You are loved and loving being. You are absolutely adored. You are unconditionally celebrated and loved, and your nature is love. <br>Your nature is freedom. Your nature is peace. Your nature is that. So if you can be more like the real you with whatever you're experiencing, you tend to step back towards that because you tend to end up questioning these boundaries that got put on you by conditioning or that you put on yourself, you know. And then when you choose that authentic you, you automatically align with your power, and also you end up feeling wonderful—not because you're trying to, but because it's when you align with your true nature, you will feel good. Like aligning with love, peace, freedom, and joy feels good. You know, it's like true freedom, you know.<br>Okay, and then so those are the three general things I would lift up, but I'll also lift up one specific thing like an action even though it's not actually an action, and that is meditation. I highly recommend meditation because—okay, so a long-term meditation practice changes the way that you relate to form—all form—not because you're trying to, but because you're going and investigating what you really are—consciousness itself. And as you grow in awareness of what you really are—consciousness itself, awareness itself—you change the form momentum, and you create this ledge to stand on where that peace and that love and that freedom and that joy—even if it's one billionth of your true nature—if even a little bit of that rises up and you become empowered, it makes the interfacing with the physical more palatable and more empowered because now you're doing it more from the space of the truth of who you are, even if it's only a little bit.<br><br><br>So like in meditation, you might meditate for months and not really experience anything, and then all of a sudden one day—or maybe you're not even during meditation—maybe you meditate—I recommend 40 minutes a day every day without any expectation. 40 minutes, 40 minutes, 40 minutes—just do it every day. Don't worry if you get up and say, "Did that work? Did I do it? Did I succeed?" Don't worry about that. Just do it anyway. <br>You might be three months later standing in your kitchen, and all of a sudden you just feel this peace—like real peace, not the fake peace—like I'm saying like you suddenly taste the peace, and all of a sudden you just know—really know, not just as an idea—you feel it that wow, you are a powerful being, and you have nothing to fear, and love is your true nature. Even just a little bit. Now, the ego will immediately grab it. That's what I've been looking for, and it grabs onto it, and it's like, "What did I do to get that? Tell me the process. I want to do it again." You know, that's not how it works. You can't do that, you know, but it's okay because as you consistently do that, it widens a path.<br>I love there's a Seth quote. He says something like, "Physical reality is like a bright point of light that you never look away from, but you can." Now, that may sound really mystical and crazy, but let me just put this in a metaphor. If someone were to say to you like, let's say you're in a movie theater, and you're watching a movie, and you're in the middle of the movie, so you now feel like you're in the movie. You know, if somebody in the movie said to you, "How do you return to being in the seat at the movie theater?" Do you have to go anywhere? No, you never were in the movie. The only thing you have to do is look back towards the being in the seat.<br>So now, I'm not saying it's simple in practical terms because in the physical, the sensory data that we're engaging is extremely stimulating, and the thoughts are extremely loud, and you know, I know practically speaking, many people will meditate for hours and just say, "Screw this; this is not helping." That's fine. Yet, in choosing to focus first on something neutral in your mind and just control your focus at first and just like basically reclaim your focus, even just doing that is like taking one step away from being lost and staring at the movie screen. <br>And eventually, it's not that you go to being the person in the movie theater; it's just that all of a sudden, it is there. I think that's how I experienced it at least. Like all of a sudden, I was like having an out-of-body experience, and I realized, "Oh, I was already here," and I was seeing a reality more real than this, more colorful than this, and I'm like, "What the—this is crazy. This is so real," like you know. But it's not like I had to go; it was just just another movie that my soul was engaged in, you know.<br>Anyway, so I highly recommend meditation, and without—and it's important not to have any expectation. I know that I that sounded pretty stimulating what I just said, but it's important not to have any expectation. And the way I like to recommend meditation is as a form of investigation. So what I mean is just go look. Don't make up anything. Don't make up anything. Don't make up any thoughts, any stories. Don't go look for something specific. Just go see what is my awareness beneath thought. Go look. Be a scientist. Be very objective about it. And then thoughts will come. You know, you'll start in half a second, "Am I experiencing this?" and you'll think some thought. That's okay. Let that go. And then another thought will come. That's okay. Let that go. It's fine. You know, you just look, and don't settle for thoughts. You see, don't settle for a story.<br><br><br>And as we do that experientially, the larger parts of our self can rise up all on their own. That's very powerful. Okay, and then Angie mentioned two things she wanted me to include in my talk today that I'll just kind of call out specifically, and then I'm going to open it up to Q&amp;A because I think Q&amp;A is more important. She said, first of all, based on those experiences and your philosophy of life today, what principles guide your married life, your life with your children, and your work? I would say I try to choose authenticity and love wherever I can, no matter what is going on. I just try to be me, you know. And that might mean I feel angry sometimes or something. <br>That's okay. And then I try to see why, you know, oh, because usually if there's a negative feeling, it means I bought into some perception that isn't actually true. So I try to locate that. So I try to face my own fear when it arises, and I try to say yes to life. You know, fear is basically saying no to something. Well, love is an opening. It's a yes. You know, vulnerability is a wide road to love is one of the sentences I wrote in my book because if we allow ourselves to be vulnerable, even with ourselves or with the person next to you, with your loved one, do you know how powerful that is? Like they see it; they feel it.<br>So you know, I'm not saying I'm always able to do that, but that's okay that I'm not always able to do that. The question is how can we better wield an intention that is in alignment with our love and peace and freedom and joy now? And I try to think of that rather than like principles as specific things because the soul is wise. You know, so when we really align with love, we usually can feel intuitively what should be done, you know. And then the other thing Angie asked was why do I believe I was given the gift of recalling these memories, you know, and what is the purpose of that remembrance? So first of all, I'm not special. <br>This is not like I'm some special person, and so I was given these memories. No, no, that's not how it works. We all have done something similar. It's just very common not to remember. That's fine. That's part of the name of the game here. Like I said, I did ask for some pre-birth memory, pre-life, but it doesn't matter actually because basically, we all are what we all are. Like you can't not be what you are. That—I mean, that was the main message that I was shown in my pre-birth experience. You can't not be that. You know, you can't not be the whole; you can't not be spirit.<br>So why don't we remember though? Because our form association is deep. What I mean is we have become so associated with the thoughts, we become so associated with the body, we become so associated with the story, we've become so associated with the pain or so associated with the negative self-perceptions that we think life proved to us. "I was abused when I was a child, so I felt shame my whole life. I'm just a shameful person." <br>No, you're not, but you may be associating with that deeply, you know. When so when I was a small child, I had some of this pre-birth memory in part because I was not deeply associated into the form yet, and that's why young children are—you know, they're able to come and go. They have out-of-body experiences quite commonly because they're not so deeply focused on the movie yet. But by the time your parents tell you a few times, "This is your name; this is what you do; this is how you talk; treat your sister a certain way; time to go to school," you know, as that happens, we cement our focus into the physical.<br>Are we ever truly stuck here? No, never, never, never, never. It's just that the physical is a very, very, very dense set of forms that is arising on and in your consciousness. So the way then to knowing our true selves is to just put that down and to align more closely with the love and the peace and the freedom and the joy of our true nature. Okay, that's it. I hit the hour pretty close. Thank you so much. You did very well. So and thank you for addressing the questions that I asked you some time ago. So do you believe that part of your purpose then in this particular lifetime is not only to remember those pre-birth memories but also to bring them forward and share the message to give people hope and a sense of there being something beyond so they don't live in such despair? I mean, I'm assuming that that's the natural sort of evolution of all of this. Do you—what do you say to that?<br><br><br>Well, I don't mean to sound mystical here, but I actually have some awareness around that that I felt called not to share—nudged not to share. I will at least simply say that I'm excited to be a part of the awakening that's taking place on Earth, as we all are. Like this is the moment of awakening. Awakening is just the term for the shift in consciousness that's taking place in the human race right now. You know, in my pre-birth experience, I could see it was like the beginning was like the early act of that. It was the early part of that act of the play, you know, the awakening act. <br>And being a part of the awakening act on Earth—this is a heck of an experiment we got going on here on Earth to see if we can really process all this fear for all these thousands of years of history, you know, and really like grow up, really evolve. To be a part of that, even in a small part—oh, that is the coolest. So I can at least say that I'm passionate about at least if because if even one other person feels more empowered and actually goes and touches the deeper part of them, then that's awesome, you know, because that's it. I mean, I so I don't have any sense of scope or anything like that. <br>I mean, the scope has happened. I can't deny that, like the book has done very well, and I've met so many amazing people. I've met 50 other pre-birth experiencers by now probably, so this has created kind of a community even though I don't consider myself a community builder. That's not my calling. My calling is more this type of thing where I'm called to share information and frame it in a concise way. That's kind of my thing, and that's all I know. Yeah, and so I just want to align with that, and whatever happens is fine, like you know. I don't have any expectation around it either.<br><br><br>I'd like to encourage people to please ask questions, and those of you here as well to come forward. Interesting that you had the experience at the very beginning when you were telling us about all of this with that other being on the other side that you seemed to admire. You perceived that he or she—it had had some very special experiences here and sort of earned some brownie points as a result. Um, and sorry—I wouldn't say brownie points. I don't know how to—yeah, okay, just admiration if you will, interest, curiosity from other beings such as yourself. He had earned it—had earned some respect perhaps by having gone undergone the experiences that it did undergo in a particular lifetime on Earth. Is that very much very much so? Yes, very, very much so.<br>That suggests to me that on the other side, you were there of an innocent soul perhaps or hadn't had that depth of experience among beings that had had a great deal of experience. So it's kind of—is—are all the beings in one particular pool? I would have thought that perhaps that being would have been so evolved that perhaps they would have been in a different pool from—yes, that's a great question. Yeah, that's a great question. Okay, so first of all, there's not just like—when we say the other side, we tend to think it's one—there's like Earth and there's the other side, and that's it. No, no, no, there's like a multiverse of many reality systems. Okay, so it is true that there is such a thing as what I like to call vibrational geography. <br>So what I mean is you tend to go where you resonate, you know. So you know, if you are a certain type of being, you tend to go to a place or be with other beings that are like that. It—you know, I mean, that's where you resonate, so you go there because intention produces an immediate effect. So Earth is a place where you could shove two people in a room that aren't the same, and you got to be stuck with them, kind of thing. You know, you got to deal with them. You know, that's part of the value of Earth actually.<br>But anyway, higher evolved beings—there is such a thing as reality systems that only very evolved beings can access because the refinement is so freaking high. But that doesn't mean that higher beings can't visit quote-unquote lower—I hate putting this in duality terms—but lower realms. And in that experience that I just shared, I remember being with a group of probably hundreds of other beings, and there was this landscape of light, and we were moving along the landscape in a group doing some energetic work. And from what I remember, all that one being was very unique. Most of us were not like that being, but for some reason, this was interesting to him. <br>I mean, that's all it takes is interest, you know. Like what you know, like for instance, if you were an Olympic tennis player, there's no reason you couldn't go down to the local high school and play a game of tennis for fun. There's no reason you couldn't do that. Why not? Now, they couldn't come up to the Olympics and participate because they're not that skilled. Me too. I understand. Yeah, maybe he came down to your level, and I hate to put it that way as well, but perhaps to inspire some of you to try out some of these bigger challenges. I wonder.<br>Well, I certainly can't speak for him, and this felt like millions of years ago to me. I can at least say I knew that he was doing the same energetic work we were doing, so he had a shared interest with us. I can't say anything else for him. I will say that like—so I shared this about six years ago, and a couple—maybe two or three years ago—I heard a Bob Monroe—he's in the out-of-body explorer—comment where he said that many of us initially agree to incarnate because we become inspired by seeing a being who is godlike by comparison because they have processed this experience. <br>That is—I mean, I maybe wouldn't use those exact words, but that is very much what I experienced, you know. I came across this incredibly powerful, wise, loving being, and it was like, "Oh my gosh, like you, I want to do that." You know, it was just like, "I will do it," and it was like, "I don't care if it takes a thousand lifetimes." I mean, that's the feeling when you see this depth of joy, you know.<br>It sounds as though you encountered him—and again, time is not linear there, so it's difficult to talk in—but it sounds as though you encountered him early on as it were, and then you had some lifetimes, and then you encountered him again. Yeah, put a timeline on it. So can speak to that the difference before and after? Why? What was the intention? The intention? So souls are kind of—okay, I don't mean—I really don't like to pigeonhole things down in language, but I'll just make a broad statement. Our true nature is very childlike and joyful. So the way that I was approaching him was almost like a child saying, "Hey, look, I made this neat thing. <br>I'm doing this thing." Okay, but I had already lived many times, so I was not the same. I had done—I had played some tennis, you know. You wanted to go back, and then I went back to the Olympics and said, "Hey, you inspired me to play tennis," yeah, and I'm like, "I'm playing some tennis. I'm not in the Olympics yet, but see, I'm playing some tennis." Something like that.<br><br><br>Gotcha. Very nice. We have a question from Matt: What styles of meditation do you enjoy the most? So I mean, this question—we like to think in terms of form type, you know. So this type of meditation does this, and that type of meditation does that, but it's not that simple. This is actually about intention. So each individual may appreciate a different form of meditation. For myself, I appreciate a form that is close to transcendental meditation, I guess you call it TM. <br>I describe that meditation exercise in part four of my book, which is available to be read online for free. So anybody who would like to see that meditation exercise, it's in towards the end. Yeah, I mean, I so I don't—I'm hesitant to put like a word on it and make it sound like this process is the one that works. Now, certain processes may resonate more or less for certain individuals.<br>Yeah, well, when you were describing meditation as one of your themes, if you will, that's what I was sort of jotting it down as. What is for you the intention? It sounds as though a quieting of the mind is certainly part of it, but is it actually getting in touch with your absolute essence? Is that the goal? So yeah, that's a good question. I'm okay. So yeah, this is another good example of like kind of a physical question like, "What is the product you're trying to achieve?" You know, because that's how we think in the physical like, "What are you—what's the output?" We tend to think a lot of product outcome. Okay, but for me, it's more like, "Why would I not want to touch the other ocean of love and peace and joy and freedom? It is the most blissful freaking thing. Why would I not want to be empowered by my true nature? <br>Why would instead—why would I choose to constantly focus on the painful movie?" Now, sometimes I do, and I go to work all week and be super busy and not meditate for a few days, and suddenly I start getting you know more stressed, and I feel that, you know. I feel it doesn't feel good like being lost in the dream of thought is actually not satisfying. Whereas true satisfaction—your question is a little bit like asking like, "Why would you go get true satisfaction?" Something like that.<br><br><br>Well, I—this is a crude analogy, but I'm just thinking of you know a college student that goes off and has a happy family life and gets a little homesick as much as they enjoy the challenge of being at university. It's just nice to go home and sort of just eat pie and be with your family and then recharge and then you can go out and face the world again. Is that—yes, that metaphor means to me is even a much more full return to the non-physical. <br>So while I've had out-of-body experiences that do feel like that, I would not say I've ever really fully returned home and eaten the pie. I yearn for that actually. Okay, I desperately yearn for that, but I also know that while I'm out here in the wilderness, there's a lot of possibility like this is a valuable opportunity, so I might as well do the work. Like I'm not at the end of the school year yet, you know, metaphorically. I can't go home yet. It's a long drive.<br>Yeah, while you were talking, some of the things that came to mind—I mean, I think it was a splendid presentation by the way—but some of the things that came to mind with your metaphors were sort of enduring with grace, courage, intrinsic motivation, some of these kind of adjectives and nouns sort of came to my mind because it sounds as though you know we buy into this reality, and it is darn difficult a lot of the time, but I think your message if you will, what you've touched is that in spite of it all, you know, it is there for a purpose, for a reason.<br>If you can step up and endure and do it with love and grace and be in it for the ride and know that it's only skin deep, you know, it's a simulation that we're buying into for the here and now, and we will be rewarded. We will grow exponentially and inform the collective as a result if we can be those courageous individual beings to have that journey with fearlessness and love. That's kind of where it's at. That's what I think I'm hearing.<br><br><br>Yeah, I agree with that except I wouldn't say it's rewarded, and I wouldn't say that rewarding—perhaps yeah, rewarding. Okay, so yes, I mean, I agree with yes, it is about that grace. It is about how we choose to respond. So let's take a metaphor. Let's say that you have—there's a scorpion in your hand, all right? You're holding a scorpion, and it's scary, and it pokes you with its little feet, and it could sting you. The question is not whether or not there's a scorpion in your hand. <br>So in this, what that means is the question is not whether or not you're sick. It's not whether or not you're old. It's not whether or not you have no money. It's not whether or not somebody said something mean to you or you are seen or not seen. It's not whether or not you can jump 100 feet in the air or you can barely walk. You know, even if the thing you're holding is pokey, how are you holding it? What is the quality with which you hold it? Okay, so now I'll actually—this reminds me of a simple short story. When I was a kid, I had hermit crabs, and the hermit crabs—I love my hermit crabs. I had so much love for them. I was probably—I don't know—12, maybe 10. I don't know, and I wanted to give them a bath, which is not a good idea, but I didn't know that. <br>So I put these hermit crabs on my hand, and I put them under the kitchen faucet, and I ran water over them, and the crabs immediately grabbed under my hand, the flesh of my hand, with their big claws as hard as they could because this water is threatening to blow them away. So I start screaming and crying because I have—I think it was three crabs if I remember correctly—grabbing a hold in my hand, and it hurts so bad, and I'm screaming, and my father comes running, and I'm trying to shake him off because I got crab stuck on my hand. My father very calmly he says, "Put your hand—put the back of your hand down on the counter and don't move." And I listen to him, and he's like, and I did that, and at first they didn't let go, and I was still like kind of screaming, and he said, "Just wait. Just hold your hand." He said, "Use your willpower and just hold your hand. <br>Don't fight them." They let go, and they walked away after a few seconds because I changed my behavior, not because you know the crabs were just holding on, you know, but I needed to choose peace, and I needed to say yes and not fight the pain. Now, that's just a simple example, but I think it's not a terrible example for like we hold circumstances in our lives a certain way. Do we hold them in fear, or do we choose love? Or do we choose to acknowledge the meaning that we're putting on the circumstances? Like we always have a quality of choice. It's the quality that matters. I love that Bashar quote, "Circumstances don't matter; only state of being matters." And I want to lift up you can always choose your state of being. <br>And someone says, "What?" Like so I've experienced bipolar lows, depression that's so freaking painful that I understand why people would kill themselves. I mean, I laugh because I know in the greater context it's nothing, but in the moment, it hurts so bad that you can't feel good. It's only pain. It's only sheer pain. When that arises, that is the crab in the hand. That is the scorpion in like what I mean is like how do I respond to that? Do I allow it? Do I fight it? Do I choose the best love, peace, joy, freedom that I can even right now? What if peace means I can't do anything but go take a two-hour nap? Then I'll go take a two-hour nap. What if peace means like I want to go paint my models? <br>I sometimes I paint little miniatures for fun. Maybe I'll go paint. Maybe I don't feel good, but I'll paint anyway, and I'll focus on that good thing. How am I holding the pain even if it's extreme? Now, ironically, interestingly, as we shift towards acceptance, the physical changes. The body changes. Healing happens, not because we're trying to get rid of it, but because we stop putting energy into the no into the fear. You know, we started saying yes to life, and when we say yes to life, no matter what has arisen, life says yes back. It's beautiful. So we don't do it because we're trying to change the circumstances. We do it because we trust life, or we trust our own body. We trust ourselves anyway.<br><br><br>Yeah, go ahead. That's okay. I think what I'm hearing is that life is full of challenges. That's a given. Okay, that's part of the nature of the existence. It's really how you handle it. It's how you handle each challenge, perceive it, and you have a choice. You can be fear-filled, or you can be confident that there's a greater purpose and that this too shall pass. Is that sort of what I'm hearing you say essentially? Yes, so two things. So first of all, the only thing that's assured here is limitation. <br>Okay, not even necessarily challenge because a super evolved being could have a headache and not have any problem with it. It's not a challenge. Fair enough. So you know, but practically speaking, for the vast, vast majority of us, absolutely challenge is going to happen in life. Pain is going to happen, and usually that equates to suffering, which is the negative meaning we put on it because we haven't processed all this limitation yet. That practically speaking, yes, of course, that's that's true.<br>Patience. Okay, so the what was the other thing you said about the quality of—well, how we handle it essentially the crux. So you said something about choosing courage. So it's not even like you look at your fear, and you go, "Oh, I'm not supposed to be afraid. The right thing to do is to be courageous." This is actually about acknowledging even the fear. Like this is about saying yes to so everything so much that you even see where you feel fear, and you acknowledge how you feel, and you own how you feel, and you let yourself see it and feel it. And in your life, you see, "How is my behavior affecting the person next to me? How could I actually choose more compassion and love?" Oh, but my—you know, the ego will say, "My stupid partner, it's their thing because they're always mad or whatever," you know. <br>Okay, well, there are times when the wise choice is to draw a line in the sand and step away from an unhealthy situation. Of course, but do that from a place of peace and freedom and genuine discernment, not egoic, you know. Rather, can you bring love to them and understanding to them? Like people tend to see that. They tend to feel it because we all want that. We all want that real connection, that real love. So if you really arrive to somebody in that and like make that choice, that has an effect. Yeah, so it's like what is the quality of the choice, the quality of the intention?<br>Yeah, you talk a lot about intention, and of course, intention is everything. I mean, even just take something as 3D as the legal system in the country. Okay, the ultimate result can be the same, but you know, somebody can end up dead, but the perpetrator's intention will have a huge impact on whether they're sentenced or whether they're let off—manslaughter versus meditated murder. These are just basic examples. So even in our system here, intention is everything. <br>Yeah, as a simple example, like let's say you know in the physical we tend to think, "Well, what type of action did you take? What was the action?" And so like let's say like giving money to charity, you know, there's maybe two people who gave money to charity. The first one gave money to charity because now I get to brag that I gave money to charity, or maybe my church members saw me give money to charity, or maybe I don't really care, but I'm just going to do this because this person said I should, you know, whatever, versus the second person who quietly and just because they want to give, they give. <br>They give. Maybe it wasn't even easy for them. It's like that parable when Jesus says the woman who gave one coin or two coins or something—it's all she had, and she gave it for the church, and he said, "Truly I say to you, this woman gave more than all of you who have given all this money because her quality of intention was in the right place." You see, intention indeed.<br>We have lots of questions, so Linda is asking regarding the pre-born contract. You know, you will have an agreement, a contract. Does meditation help you know what your plan is when you're on Earth? Well, I can at least say that meditation will over time tend to reconnect you with your deeper self. That's that's the only thing I can really say. However, yes, the deeper self knows what the contract is, so it may be useful to know it, but it may often not be useful to know it, and that's okay.<br><br><br>Okay, what are your thoughts on Hemi-Sync sound meditation from Cara? I just came back from the Monroe Institute. It was very helpful for me. What silent versus guided meditation do you prefer? One over the other? So I know many people who swear by Hemi-Sync or other you know type of technology that helps them meditate. I personally can't stand it. Just just personally for me, it is I feel like I'm being something's being forced on me, and I don't like that. <br>So I prefer silent meditation myself. I've never I never do guided meditation for me. There just just for me like you know for for someone who's very form-focused and needs to hear direction, that may be very useful. I know there are many people who that's what benefits them, but for me, I typically would start by I picture a shape in my mind like a square or a diamond or a triangle, and I will simply visualize it in my mind and draw my attention along it as focus. <br>And then I'll be thinking about lunch, and then I'll bring my attention back to the shape, and I will do that and feel a slowing of the momentum of thought in the mind and in the body, and eventually, if I'm able to keep a very clear focus, I might drop the shape and look purely towards awareness itself, and there's so much there. So that is definitely silent. You know, for me, that's not like it wouldn't be helpful for me if somebody was telling me you know do this or picture this. That's that's not necessary.<br>What about if someone basically wants to get in touch with their guides or get in touch with their higher self? Do you believe that meditation is a way to do that? Yes, yes, in simple terms, yes, because meditation again is like starting to look away from the movie. So in the movie theater analogy, picture that you are staring at the screen sitting in the movie theater, and there's people on either side of you who are trying to help you. That's kind of how it is, and they're kind of like ready to whisper in your ear or give you a nudge, you know. <br>So how can you be more aware of their presence? Well, as you return to being aware that you are the person in the movie theater, their presence may be made known to you, or maybe even not just maybe not their presence, maybe just their guidance. I have had non-physical interaction with others both those who are physically alive like I've interacted at the higher self level and confirmed it a few times. I've had four probably five times I think now consider that last one where I've confirmed that I've had that interaction. <br>So I just know that like there is that possibility to have interaction both with people who we physically know and those who are non-physical, and yes, that is more readily it's much easier to do when we're not so form-associated. Form association is like a big old distraction. It's like a big block. It's like you can't see past you can't see past thoughts are loud. Put it that way like the thoughts that we have here on Earth they're very slow they're very dense by comparison to the very quick refined level of vibration that guides might be able to interact with us in consciousness.<br><br><br>Okay, if we're part of the unity of God, a unit of God, if our perspective of God is all-knowing, why would we have to learn and experience a need to expand? Yeah, there's no need. It's not about need. It's a choice. The only way to actually grow and to actually expand is to actually experience. That's a simple way to put that. So if we choose to expand, that's not have to. There's no need. You don't have to incarnate if you don't want to. You don't have to. There's no need placed on you. <br>You don't need to do anything. Like, you actually need to do absolutely nothing. Even while we're talking about all this quality of intention stuff, at the same time, there is nothing required of you. Like, you are so free. You can just be, and that is more than enough. That's true, and that's true on the other side as well, where you don't have to choose something.<br>Okay, but if you want to lift weights, that means you got to lay on the weight bench and you have to push the weight. It's not automatically done. It'd be like somebody saying, "Well, how do you grow? Why would we have to lift weights to grow strong?" Well, it's because precisely the counter pressure of the weight is the thing that helps you grow. So if you want to actually experience duality and all of the alternate perspectives that are possible, as I described earlier in the conversation, then you actually need to experience it. And that's not a need like you must do it. It's a need because that's just what it means if you want to know something. You have to be something you're not.<br>Well, let's take your example. When you first started talking about seeing this being on the other side, as it were, being curious and somewhat in awe of the experience that being had, and you're wanting to be like that experience because you valued it in some way, right? You didn't have to do that. I assume you chose to do that. Yeah, it would be like, "Would you like joy times a thousand?" Yeah, wow. Okay, you can feel that much joy. You can know that much freedom, but you already have joy. You just want to have more. Yes, well, yes.<br>Okay, so this is where duality gets in the way of us conversing about this successfully because now we start to think of joy as a quantity, whereas the beingness itself is already perfect. It's already joy. It's already love. It's already peace. It's already freedom. It doesn't have to do anything. It's already just it. It'd be like saying the water wanted to be more wet. Water's just wet. It's just wet.<br>But it's not just the individual who grows from that experience. You take it back to the collective, do you not? Yes, because all the drops in the ocean are of one ocean. And then within the ocean, there are ponds, like smaller groups of consciousness. So the entire human race actually is like a pond, a collective consciousness of everyone who's participating. And when you shift your consciousness, when you integrate something, you actually are communicating with every single other player in the game. You may not be able to see it, but you are. So when you choose love over fear, when you process your own crap, you're like a candle that's getting brighter in the cave of the pond. And then everyone else sees it and feels it and knows it, and you're helping them. Does that inform the collective? And so everybody's becoming, I don't know, wiser, more evolved, smarter.<br>One other thing popped in. This might sound super strange, but I remember knowing after one of my meditations that if you could even have one thought that had never occurred before—and what I mean is by a thought not just like a named thought but like a type of thought within a certain context, from a certain perspective—even one entirely unique thought for your entire lifetime, that would be a contribution. Your entire lifetime would have been worth it. That would have been an amazing contribution because all that is the ocean. It then knows it too. You are it. You are it. So you added something.<br>So you could say that we become something we're not. We become blind so that we can be on the frontier of creation, so that we can experience novelty, so that we can add novelty and newness. That is a creative service. We're performing a service from a human limited perspective, a 3D perspective.<br>When we think about the afterlife, when we think about source, the creator, the universe, I think we automatically imbue that with all the qualities of everything. It's omnipresent, omniscient, it is. And that's a fair thing to do. Contradictory to think that we need to have these experiences to inform the collective because the collective already has it anyway. Okay, so this confusion, yes, so this is a fair point, but it's only a paradox from our side. Because from our side, it's either A or B. Sure, that's what duality means. Are we perfect or are we not? Are we adding something or are we not? It can't be both. Which one is it? That's the nature of duality. That's the very way we think about reality from here.<br>But the thing is, our true nature, I don't know how to describe this. It already—oh, we're getting beyond what language can say. Let me say this: God is perfect but is also ever refining and ever growing too. And we're participating and helping with that. Those two things are simultaneously true, and they're not contradictory. And part of that is because all the sequence is taking place in the one now. It's only one big now, the now with a capital N. So it's not like nothing can be added to all that is because all that is is already all. We are reaching the boundaries.<br>I try to speak a little bit to this in the book, but it's very difficult to say from a duality perspective because it's based in an assumption that it's either or and can't be both. And over there, it's both. We tend to want it to be either or. Correct. Yeah, that's what it sounds like.<br><br><br>Okay, when we decide to incarnate, is there a plan for our earthly experience or a goal for our time on this plane? If so, do we design that plan or goal, or is it crafted for us? Yes, there is. Now, I can't speak for any individual person because every one of us is unique. And I think that beings who have less experience tend to have less specific interaction or intentions, goals for a life. And as we gain experience, we refine and get more and more specific and more and more detailed in what we're trying to refine. At the beginning, basically, when you have low experience, you just want to get in, just have experience.<br>Do we craft that? Yes, but with the help of very wise guides. Guide is such a weak word. It means beings who are very loving and wise and have a lot of experience doing this. And if there's something specific we're trying to integrate, a guide who is very loving and involved in that way might be involved with helping us craft it. Like a master of that. So let's say you wanted to learn compassion in a new way—learn not meaning learning in an intellectual sense, but you wanted to understand compassion because compassion is an aspect of love. <br>And let's say you wanted to know compassion from within a very specific type of constraint. There may be a being who gets that really well, really understands that, a master. And that being might help. They might say, "Okay, I understand that. I can help you with this." It'd be like the Olympic tennis player coming and saying, "Okay, you're learning tennis. Let me give you some recommendations on how you can play tennis well, what kind of course you can sign up for."<br>But we are absolutely involved because it's our skin in the game, you could say. It's us as individuals who are actually walking the walk.<br><br><br>Okay, here's another question. You mentioned that now is the time of human awakening and also that the scope of what we do—for example, individual versus great scale—doesn't matter. Is there—I'm not saying it doesn't matter, I'm saying it's not of primary importance. Is there an important reality to the challenges of life, for example, poverty, war, climate change, etc., but only in the sense that it helps us individually or collectively evolve? Could you read that second part of that question again? Yeah, is there an important reality to the challenges of life, for example, poverty, war, climate change, or only in the sense that it helps us individually or collectively evolve?<br>Okay, so the important nature of the reality of those things is that we do not want other parts of ourselves to suffer. Love doesn't want anyone to suffer. Suffering is not great. It's not optimal. The reason I say that first is because really what's happening is not specifically poverty and specifically war. Those things just mean it's very likely that many brothers and sisters, other parts of our self, are going through great challenge. And love is a call to solve those things. It's a call to heal the world. It's a call to heal our brothers and sisters and to help them be strong and to meet their needs. That is what love is about.<br>Now, I'm saying it that way because I don't want to imbue a given circumstance with some fundamental meaning. Actually, even poverty doesn't have a fundamental meaning. It's just a limitation. It's a context that is actually neutral too. It's just how are the players doing with it? And it's harder to do things when you don't have money, and it's more painful. Life becomes more constrained. Love is about trying to help the other. And again, from this 3D perspective, it's so full of contradictions. <br>So I'm coming from that perspective, but it is very complicated because supposedly—and I believe this—we come here for a purpose. We come here to be challenged, to face limitations. Maybe some of those limitations do involve a great deal of pain and suffering. Yet we don't want to suffer, and we don't want our loved ones to suffer or our fellow beings to suffer. Yet the experience of life is full of suffering. So isn't that a paradox in and of itself?<br>Okay, so let me put it this way. When we sign up for life pre-life, our goal is not to cause suffering, but our goal is not to avoid suffering. If we wanted to avoid suffering, there would be no physical universe. We would not create this. That's a very interesting perspective. I've never heard it that way. All I mean is that the suffering we see is possible, but suffering is never guaranteed. This is really important because love and peace and freedom and joy are the truth. They are the truth. They have the power. But the thing is, fear is hell. Honestly, the ego, fear is hell. Ego is hell. Rejection is hell. And so suffering happens because the limitations are so high, and we're not evolved enough yet. So it's just that we are given the opportunity to engage very high constraints, and we seek to do our best to shine love into these levels of constraints and to heal ourselves and others and to actually bring joy and live a joyful life even in the constraints.<br>Could you repeat what you said before about where something along the lines of when not to cause suffering? Well, our intention is not to cause suffering, but that doesn't mean that we don't experience suffering. Well, the second part of my statement was our goal is not to avoid suffering when we come into the physical because we know that that might happen. Okay, it's not that we're ignorant. We know from the pre-life state that we see that fearlessness is the truth. So we don't see it the same way as we do when we're here. When we're here, it hurts in a way that is not seen pre-life. It's just that the deeper truth is seen very clearly pre-life. Like, it's just seen. We are immortal beings. There's nothing to fear.<br>So in my case, with this life that I signed up for, I knew that I might be crushed in a way that would push me far past anything I'd ever been able to tolerate before. Yeah, that's and so then a human might say, "Well, that sounds like masochism. You just signed up to be hurt." No, no. I signed up to lift 827 pounds, whatever it is. I'm just making a metaphor now. I signed up to see, can I heal that? <br>Can I grow that much love? Can I accept that level of depth in my being, in my body, the body of my spirit? Can the body of my spirit process it? It's not about the physical because the thing is that the physical is going to fall away anyway. We see it's temporary. In the context of the soul, human life is quite short, a short little thing. So it's not that we're ignorant to the pain, but it's also like one lifetime is so short. We know it's temporary. We know we can't actually be harmed. We know we can't actually fail. And so in that, we may choose to come to a place where pain might happen. Pain is just part of the simulation.<br><br><br>I'm sorry, I'm just looking at some of the questions that are coming in. Pain being different from suffering, real quick. Sorry, when I say pain is part of the simulation, pain is, but suffering is not necessarily. The reason I'm differentiating that is the physical will have pain in it. The body is going to have moments of pain, just physical as well as emotional as well as psychological. I won't simplify it, but in general, yes. But some of that falls into the second category, which is the suffering piece. Suffering is the meaning we put on it. Suffering is the negative we buy into. Suffering is the fear we reject. There's a lot of that, and the vast majority of the negative on earth is that, not the pain.<br>I love that distinction between pain and suffering. I haven't really thought about it from that perspective before. I think I have to agree with you. The pain is going to be there, but it's what we make of it that determines whether we make it suffering or not, based on our perspective of how we accept it, how we handle it. And that, by the way, the difference between pain that is just pain and that is accepted versus pain that is rejected and throws us into a tizzy, the difference between those two is like the being that I saw on the other side chose the first one. He accepted it. He chose fortitude, and he chose to hang in there, and he chose to be love anyway, and he chose peace anyway, and whatever that meant for him, he chose to focus on the good anyway. But it takes a lot to be able to do that. Yes, it does. Yes, it does. Very deep to be able to find that in yourself. Not everybody has that. Not everybody has that sort of faith that anchors them to that.<br><br><br>This is important. Okay, so when you say not everyone has that, I'm just going to use a super crude metaphor here because I don't like putting people on a scale because this is not how souls are. It's more like different colors than they are on a scale of strength. It's more like grapevines and oak trees. Like, which one's better? They're just different. One produces sweet grapes, and the other one's firm and strong and tall. But for a second, let's say that each individual is at a point of evolution where they can lift a certain weight successfully before they get crushed under it. Maybe person A can lift 10 pounds, and person B can lift 80, and person C can lift 190. I mean, I hate putting it in this limited of terms, but let's just do that for a second. <br>So your question is, you said not everybody has the ability to lift the weight. Well, if earth has a weight that's between 70 and 140 pounds, it's not true to say that there are beings who can't meet that circumstance without fear. It takes a certain level of soul proficiency to be able to meet those challenges if you will. But someone who has a great deal of faith, someone who perhaps has had prior experiences that are relative, it's easier to endure. There are some people who are further along on that journey and can accept it better than others. Wouldn't you say it takes experience to be able to take adversity? Perhaps, yes. It takes some evolution to be able to meet a certain constraint set with love.<br>But the guides are really wise. So when we sign up for a lifetime, we tend to shoot for an optimal level of challenge. Actually, I know it may seem super hard and extreme, but we want to—we as souls are the ones that choose to push the envelope. The guides are often the ones that are like, "No, no, no, back off a little. That's too much. You're biting off too much sandwich. That sandwich is too big. You're not going to be able to swallow that sandwich." And we're like, "But I want to do it all at once. I want to eat all the sandwich because I see all the juicy opportunity that is possible." We're the ones often that do that, and it's the guides who help us kind of choose an optimal level of challenge.<br><br><br>Okay, here's a question. Can our souls become damaged by being on earth with all the suffering that we're going through in this world? Not in a true way, no. They can be temporarily all mucked up, temporarily squashed, but the soul can't actually be damaged. In fact, when I met that being on the other side, I asked him, "Were you healed?" Because I saw this incredible wound that he had, not just in the body but emotionally. <br>This wound, oh my gosh, it's so beautiful. Just feeling into it, it's powerful. And it was like, yes, that entire thing was like a cavern that had been dug out that now love could fill. It was like excavating a shape in the earth. All that negative, all that pain, now that it had been dug out, that much could be filled with the concrete of love, something like that, or the water of love—better than concrete. The water of love could fill that shape now because it had been so. So we are always healed, and that soul truly, at the truest level, can't be damaged. The beingness can't be damaged. It would be like saying, can the movie harm the movie screen? What if we put really scary stuff on it? What if we flash really bright light at the movie screen? Can we hurt it? No. Your awareness itself is your awareness itself. It can't truly be harmed.<br>So those two comments help put that in context. So let me ask you then, for people who are going through great hardships here in the times that we're living in—for example, parents who've lost children, or loved ones in general, people who have been sexually abused as children, people who are dealing with addictions, people who are thinking about committing suicide—what would your message be, given your perspective? Well, I felt a nudge come through in spirit to simply say, "Love is the answer." But I want to put some color to that because that doesn't sound sufficient when you're ready to commit suicide.<br>First of all, the answer to that question is unique for each individual. There's not one answer because each one of us deals with form in our own way. So each individual will need something different. But in general, what I would lift up is find the fear, find the pain, and don't be afraid of it anymore. Like, there's nothing to do this way. I know this is a tall statement when you're really suffering. <br>I know it. I know this following thing is a tall statement, but life is not your enemy. The physical universe is not your enemy. Your body is not your enemy. Your circumstances are not your enemy. So are you brave enough and bold enough to identify where you made them an enemy? Let's say you suffered terrible loss. It's okay if you suffer. It's okay if you have that pain. You don't have to say no to it. You can mourn, but can you mourn in a way that is loving, accepting, pure, and non-rejecting? How do you hold the scorpion of pain, of sorrow? What's the quality with which you hold it?<br>Or if it's child abuse, maybe you were deeply shown you are powerless, you are shameful, you're not worthy of love. I have known people very close to me—I'm thinking of one in particular that I very deeply loved and love—who experienced this. I've seen the damage. It's absolutely terrible. But how do we now face that pain and heal? What do we do with the now? That's the only thing we have to worry about. It's not about all the history. It's about what do we choose now?<br>Now that all that has happened, what can you do in this now to face it and process it and to choose love and peace and joy and freedom in your own way? The person that I knew that went through this, she ended up writing a letter to her abuser, and she read it to him. It took her years to build up the courage to do that, to draw a line in the sand and to take back her own power, which wasn't just egoic. It was like, "No, I claim that I'm valuable, and what you did to me was wrong." And she read him a letter to that effect. Gosh, how powerful is that?<br>So I'm simply saying that each of us has a way in the deeper parts of ourselves. Listen to your intuition. Listen to that call, that call of love, for whatever it means for you to take the first step. Don't worry about all 700 steps. Your intuition will guide you in the path towards the truth of love and freedom and peace and joy.<br>Okay, so one other thing there about the reason I highlighted the word truth. I know it doesn't appear this way, but anytime there's something that terrifying that's going on and we are in terrible suffering, the fear that we have—there's some negative self-perception at the root that we think life proved to us, and it's not true. This is the key. Like, when I was laying in a hospital bed in Chongqing, and I thought I was dying, and my whole body was convulsing, and I felt this terrible pain in my nervous system before they even gave me potassium, and I thought, "I'm dying, and I'm unable to escape this agony." That is not the truth. The truth is I am awareness itself. I am consciousness itself. That substance is free. It is powerful. It is worthy. You are worthy. Like, if you could even grasp one millionth of that of the truth of that and feel one billionth of the unconditional love that source has for you, it would blast all that fear crap aside in a second.<br>So how does our intuition help guide us back to that? <br><br><br>We have another question here in the context of not causing any suffering. In examples of extreme evil, for example, mass murderers and what have you, what does the pre-birth soul get from choosing that kind of life other than just having the experience? How does this life add to the refinement of the individuated soul of the collective? Okay, well, first of all, I try to speak to this in my book too, but this is a—I have to be very careful about this because it's not like we sit down and say, "Alright, I'm going to be evil now. I'm going to be evil, and I'm going to do all this damage. Isn't that great?" No, evil is not good. <br>And by the way, when I use evil, I don't mean evil as some fundamental substance. There's no such thing as a fundamental substance called evil. There's only consciousness itself, beingness itself, which is love. And it has fear, and fear is insane, and it will cause all sorts of damage to the self and the other because it's rooted in something that's untrue, negative, running from negative self-perceptions that aren't even true. And the whole world gets full of pain and murder potentially.<br>But pre-life, it's the context we sign up for, not a guaranteed outcome. Now, that context—I have to say this carefully—it may mean that we sign up to provide some useful counter pressure to somebody in a way that's helpful for them. We might actually sign up for that, but if we do that, it's from a place of love, not because we're going to hurt them. Like, if there's some way that someone might need to learn something from us, and we want to fill some role in their life, and they actually end up learning and growing from it, they might ask us, "Please do that for me. Play that role for me." And we do that out of love.<br>The human ego does not like that. The human ego says, "No, I'm suffering, and that's it. I'm pissed, and that's it. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear that there's a larger perspective here." But the soul is very powerful and very creative and very willing to dive in and get its hands dirty, and that's what we're doing here.<br>Now, so to someone like, you know, the Hitler of the world or something, I don't put them in a different category. We all have fear, and fear is always insane. The question is, in the pre-life plan, are they signing up to murder millions of people? Oh my god. We sign up for a context, and we know that we might make fear-based choices, but we seek to bring love into it. Love is always at the root, the intentionality.<br>It's just that we can't understand that from within duality, where we're being smacked in the face and where we see others and we say, "That's terrible. I reject that." I understand from the human level that may be how it appears, but we cannot see clearly. And at the soul level, there may be some opportunity that the soul is attempting to fulfill that maybe it couldn't. Maybe fear really took over, and a choice—see, this is a free-willed system. We may make choices that are suboptimal. That's going to happen. And when that happens, we may choose something that hurts somebody else, and then they have to deal with it. That's part of the simulation. But we don't go in trying to do that. It's just we go in with love. We go in to grow, and then we may end up aligning with the fear because we're not evolved enough yet to, within whatever context was presented to us, choose love.<br>See, hurt people hurt people. So we go in to stop the chain of hurt, even knowing that we might get kind of sucked up into it. So our plans go awry essentially because we buy into the separation, into the 3D experience so fully. I wouldn't even say awry. It's just it's not even awry because that would imply that we failed. There's no failure. There's no failure. It's just that we know that might happen. We might choose that. If I have the freedom to choose to do A and not B, then that means the system has to be able to then someone's got to live with A and not B.<br>You mentioned in your talk also about the metaphor of the tree. I think you said sort of laying it down as it were, going from the trunk to the branches, and that you experienced a myriad of different possibilities. Almost if I remember as though you experienced the myriads of ways that your particular lifetime could actually go. Yes. Okay, so does that mean then that because everything is decision-based, you know, we're at constant crossroads, and we go this way opposite to that way, does that mean that there might be myriads of parallel universes where there's a Christian that took a different turn in the road that's living out that existence?<br>So, okay, so the way that I understand it is that there is one actualized thread, and there are many, many trillions and trillions and trillions of unactualized threads because the system retains all the unactualized outcomes for review because it's useful. We call that the Akashic records. And so it's possible to go into the Akashic records and pull out, like, "Show me what would have happened if I made this choice," or "Show me what happened if this person made this choice," and then we get a result. And when we review it, it's like a full-body experience. It's all the data. So you can see it, you can smell it, you can hear it, you can touch it. It looks like a full-blown reality, but it's not actually a full-blown reality. It's a recording of a potential outcome. And it may seem like there are actually truly infinite numbers of those, but there's not. It's just a really, really, really huge, practically infinite number.<br>Now, that being said, that's for one given universe. It is possible there might be other universes that have their own tons of unactualized threads. I don't know. I can only speak to what I do know, which is that in this life, I know of an actualized thread and many trillions of unactualized threads. And I know that the system has a lot of power and flexibility, and I know that there are other reality systems too. So within that, I wouldn't put it like there are other Christians, but I would say that we are all kind of shifting along the timelines at a very high rate of speed—you know, billions of times per second. Tom Campbell says it's 10 to the 23rd power units of time per second. That's a lot of units of time. So I don't know how frequently it is, but yeah, that's how I would probably put that.<br>So is it possible that there might be another reality? Like, Tom Campbell will say, "The system can take one shot of the whole system and say, 'This is very interesting. Let's reload this whole universe from this moment, and we get all new players, and we change some variables, and then we hit go, and we see now what happens.'" So Tom Campbell talks about that being possible. I just don't have any personal knowledge of that.<br><br><br>Okay, we have two more questions. We are often taught that we cannot change others; however, our compassion wants to lift people from their suffering. When someone has negative thought patterns, is it possible to help change the being's perspective to move into a more positive frequency, or are they entitled to their own experience and learning, and that we should accept their choice? <br>Those are both true in general. <br>Okay, so what we can do is offer something up. <br>That's it. Like, it's because we're talking about free-willed beings here. You too, you're a sovereign free-willed being. <br>Do you have the ability to choose what to ingest or not, whether in your mind or in your body or whatever else? Do you have the ability to choose what you believe? <br>Yes. <br>Does that mean the person next to you does as well? <br>Yes. <br>Do you have the ability to offer something to them? <br>Yes. <br>Do they have the right to choose what to do with it? <br>Yes. It's not your job to change them. Your job is to love. Put it very simply, our job is to love. It's to offer compassion and kindness and understanding. And part of the understanding thing is what inspires me. I want to share perspective because I think that's empowering. Everyone who's listening today is my brother or sister in consciousness. I want to share with them. It's like sharing with my own self, another part of myself. I love that. But I don't have any business whether or not you pick up what I say and do anything with it. Not at all. That's your business. Yeah, the individual has free will to whether to accept your advice or to reject it. Sure, yeah.<br>And now the question is, do I lose my peace if they don't accept it? No. Like, what I mean is because that's a part of wisdom too, is that we are able to see and then still not lose our peace. Is it helpful if you lose your peace and now you get grumpy because someone's not listening to your advice? Not really. You're not really adding joy to the world if you lose your peace because they didn't take something you said. Although I have to say, it's a temperament difference as well because there are some temperaments that will offer advice, and they don't really mind if the other person takes it or believes it.<br>There are temperaments that are very invested in somebody taking their advice because they sort of need that recognition for themselves. So temperament is an expression of everything we've talked about. It's not a fundamental thing. It's just another expression. It could be an ego expression. It could be an aspect of the soul in its journey that it has certain qualities it tends to manifest, a certain personality. It could be a soul-level personality that it expresses. So be it. It's not like the temperament itself is a thing. It's that it all still boils down to consciousness and the intention that it wields. A high quality of intention, even in a person who has a temperament where they're like a bull in a china shop, if they bring up a high quality of intention in themselves, they may see, "Oh, I'm a bit of a bull in a china shop. Yeah, okay."<br>I don't want to go too much over the hour, but we have two more questions. Are there specific 3D things that we can contract to do in our lifetimes, or is it more general, as in leading with intentions of love? Yeah, no, it could be very specific physical 3D things. It could be anything from processing a certain emotion, experiencing a certain perspective, being in a certain relationship with somebody. It could be one conversation you're going to have one time in your life that you really wanted to contract that in. <br>The thing is, soul contracts are not just one thing either. It's usually like the main primary goal, but yeah, we may have a primary goal of, "Hey, I'm going to be your friend in high school when you have a really tough time. I'm going to have a conversation with you, and it's going to help you." That could be like a primary goal. It's difficult for us as humans to get our arms around that because is the thing. It's about quality again, not necessarily quantity. Love is about purity. It's not about size necessarily. It doesn't need a size. Love doesn't demand an outcome. So we might come for something that might seem very small.<br>Like, for instance, just a super brief personal story because I know we're over time, but I had a three-year-old half-brother who died of brain cancer when I was in my mid-20s. And I had several people say to me, "Well, you know, how can that happen? He didn't accomplish anything." I disagree. You think he didn't accomplish anything? He was here three years. He brought together so many people. There was so much love that got to be expressed to him and from him to us. There was so much learning that took place. There was so much experience he had in his three years. How can we say three years is unsuccessful and 80 is successful? That's not the way love thinks. So I'm just putting in that perspective because when we sign up for things pre-life, it may not make a whole lot of sense to the human portion of us if we're thinking from duality metric terms.<br><br><br>This last question is actually getting into the sort of paranormal, as far as possession is concerned. So if we find that someone is possessed with a negative entity, can anything be done to help that soul—the soul who is possessed and the soul who has taken possession of someone's body? So I'm going to purposefully put the word possession down and away, kick it over to the side, and instead use the word associated with energies that are low vibration. Okay, because there's no such thing as the soul being possessed. The soul is the soul, and the body is something that is just form within the soul. So channeling is possible. Consciousness can do creative things with form, including how a body is used. But possession of a body—okay, what we really think the way I interpret the question is really are there lower vibrational forms that can interact with someone? And I would put them in two categories. I know we're short on time, so I'll try to be succinct.<br>The first category I'll call thought form, and the second category we call actual free-willed beings that are just low vibration and have a lot of fear and ego. Most of the time, it's the first one that we're talking about when we ask questions about demons or possession or that kind of thing. What I mean is thought form has a mass to it. It has a density to it in the astral. So if there has been an act of incredible anger or hatred or whatever, that can be a thought form. It has a density to it, and then if we resonate into that somehow, it might quote-unquote attach, which is more just like it's resonating into your field because you resonate with it. <br>And the other alternative is a free-willed being. We can deal with fear-based intentionality here in the physical. Someone might walk up and punch you in the face, and then you have to deal with it. It is possible for a non-physical interaction with a free-willed being that is of fear. But in both cases, this is the key: love is the power. It's the true power because the substance of your being and the substance of its being and the substance of the thought form, whatever it is, is the same stuff. And that stuff is unconditional love, peace, freedom, and joy underneath all the fear and all the twists and all the—yeah, we may have condensed it down and twisted it up, but underneath it all, it's love. So you can choose love. <br>You can choose fearlessness even on behalf of that person. We might call that prayer, focused prayer, genuine love—not like, "I want to change you and fix you and I need to fix you and something's wrong with you and I got to—" No, I'm talking like, "I love you, and I send this love and this healing to you, and that's it." Because love is so powerful. It's so high vibration. Genuine, true love—nothing fear-based can resonate with it. It can't. It'd be like saying you could have darkness in a room full of light. You just can't because darkness is only the absence of light. It doesn't exist. It's not a thing. Like, if somebody said, "How many pounds of darkness do you have?" There's no dark. You can't weigh darkness. You can't hand someone a box. It doesn't exist. It only happens when light has been obscured. You see, and in this case, the light of awareness, the light of consciousness, the light of spirit is the truth. It is the power. So the answer is we simply need to bring light back the best we can and encourage them to choose their own light the best they can.<br>Like, I've heard of soul retrieval work. I know we're over time, but beings who may be temporarily focused into a low vibration astral realm where there's a lot of negative stuff going on because they themselves are associated into it—and a soul retriever, they don't go in and try to manhandle them and slap them. They go in and say, "Focus up." I mean, in some way, like, basically, instead of looking into the muck, look up towards the light. Find the love in yourself. Find the caring. The moment we shift focus, the vibration changes because intention is the primary action of consciousness, both in the physical and in the non-physical. So we just shift our intention back towards love and peace and freedom and joy. Yeah, and that is very, very powerful.<br><br><br>I have one very final question that I just have to ask you, and that is as far as the ego is concerned, which is the kind of perpetrator or the beginning of all the fear-based emotions that we have. I think it's the result of fear, not the perpetrator. I mean, it perpetrates, but it starts in fear first. But just like our worst nemesis maybe on this planet, when we get to the other side and we take these costumes off, we can sort of shake hands and hug each other and say, "Yes, tough role that you played, but thank you for doing that because it helped me do X, Y, and Z." Would you say that the ego is really, even though it's something that we should really try to temper and try to control in some way, is actually a great ally, not an adversary, because it allows us to have this duality and this experience? <br>Absolutely. There is no adversary. Your own ego is not even an adversary. If you thought it was, that would be ego. You see, it's like there is no adversary. You have no enemies. You have no enemies. Like, no, but I have this enemy because I have this person that did this thing to me. It's okay if you choose to believe that, but underneath it all, you are connected. They are love. You are love, and you are a part of the one ocean. And they're just lost in fear, just like you get lost in fear. It's okay. Do your best to see through the enemy thing. So yes, we can put down the costume when we get to the other side. We just love each other.<br>I'm reminded of a—I won't go into depth on this for time, but early in my awakening, at the time, I was not a fan of my wife's ex-boyfriend. And I had an out-of-body experience where I interacted with his soul. I put this in the book, and I felt who he is and who he was, and I saw the absolutely incredible journey he's on in the physical, and I was like, "Holy crap." And I called him the next day, and I'm like, "Look, I just have to tell you, I think I saw your soul last night," and went on for 45 minutes about his amazing qualities and who he is. And when I was done, he said, "I have to say, if I was going to tell someone who I really am, that's I would say everything you just said." And to this day, I love the man. <br>He's close to our family. He's our friend, and when he comes into the house, I want to kneel to the guy. It was so dumb. It was so silly that I had an egoic thing about him. It didn't make any sense. I just didn't know. I didn't see him for who he was. And when we see each other for who we really are, oh my gosh, it's love. It's all that can be left because we have so much respect. We see with clarity. "Oh, you were hurt, and you were trying to do your best within that pain. I see. I'm sorry." Well, I think we see who you really are, and you're an absolute splendid soul. And thank you so very, very, very much for sharing your experience and your testimony with us. It's been absolutely inspiring.<br><br><br>Well, how can people find your book? How can people reach out to you if they want to? Sure, so my website is awalkinthephysical.com. The book, yeah, A Walk in the Physical. The book is available at the third link down on the book page to be read online for free. It's also on Amazon as an ebook or audiobook. I recommend the audiobook. Those are not free, though. You'd have to pay for those. But it's not about money. I just want to share it. I just want to get it out there. <br>The website also has a talks and interviews page. I've shared many talks on there, and I post talks as I share them. So I'm sure I'll post this on the site as well. I do try to answer emails, but I can't promise anything because I get a lot of emails. So it's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a> I'm happy to try to help anybody I can. <br>Yeah, and eventually, I'm going to hopefully move more into this work. I don't know how because I've never charged money for anything, but somehow I'm going to do more of this because this is really important. Yeah, no, absolutely. It's very inspiring and very therapeutic actually on many levels. Thank you, everybody, who's joined us. We really appreciate it. Happy Thanksgiving to everybody. Thank you again, Christian. It's been absolutely amazing. Thank you very much. Take care. Thanks. Thank you, everybody. Have a great day. Bye. Thank you.

 <br><br>18 JAN 2025<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4g5ep-vaa8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4g5ep-vaa8</a>  <br>We buy into negative self-perceptions that are not in alignment with that truth. For instance, like "I'm not free," or "I'm shameful," you know, "I'm not worthy of love" is another way to say that, or "I don't have any power." You know, these perceptions are just rampant on Earth. But the thing is, they're not in alignment with the fundamental truth underneath those perceptions. Underneath that obfuscation, you could say, is what you always, always are and were, and that is total unconditional love, peace, freedom, and joy.<br>Okay, so I'm putting it that way almost like in a technical way first because when I say, "You are love, and there's absolutely no reason that you can't feel deserving of all the love in the universe," I mean that in a very tangible way, not just like a philosophical, "Oh, that's nice to hear" way. No, your true nature is... okay, so I'm going to say this very carefully, and I've written this a few times, but I've never said this sentence publicly because, again, this is so big ego candy. Warning.<br><br><br>Okay, okay. I almost feel like my guest today needs no introduction: Christian Sundberg. If you've been watching my channel for a while, you know that this is one of the top videos on my channel. I did an interview with Christian almost three years ago, I think. Wow, was it something like that? It's been a little while. And when I released that, it automatically went to the number one most-watched video on this channel. I have since now done 200 interviews. I think I have 270 interviews on my channel as of today's date, and Christian's long-form video is in my top 10. Then I did a truncated, shorter-form video of the same video, which is also in the top 10.<br>I think the reason that people are so fascinated with Christian is because he had a very profound near-death experience, and he remembered wanting to come to Earth specifically to let his soul have an experience that he could only have here. He understands the power of who we are, and I think that as people are awakening to the power of who they are, they have connected with Christian. So I wanted to bring him back so we could have a deeper conversation. This is not going to be one where he retells his story, but we are going to dive deep into lots of different topics. So, Christian, welcome! I am so excited to talk to you.<br>Thank you so much, Lori. Just a small correction: I don't know that I've ever had an NDE. I have had... yeah, that's okay. I just try to be careful. Yeah, no, so I had a pre-birth experience and not a near-death experience. My body did almost die when I was 10 days old, and I always wonder if maybe that has something to do with this, but no, I don't know. I misspoke. I'm so sorry. Yes, pre-birth. I'm glad you corrected that.<br>No problem, no problem. That's good. Thank you. So, Christian, people all over have been contacting you, and what's really fascinating to me is that I saw the interview you did with Merkley, and we were talking, and you said that was like five or six years ago. That video, when I found it, was less than a year old, and it struck a chord with me. I have this little list that I would keep with my favorite experiences that people had had, and you were on that list for a long time. When I did this channel, it was natural to talk to you, but I think even you have been surprised with how much people have engaged with this. So, what do you think it is about your story that fascinates and draws people in?<br><br><br>Yeah, actually, I don't think it's my story specifically. I think... and in fact, sharing my story is not very... I don't think it's that important, even though it's very important to me and personal to me. I think what's far more important is the sharing of what we really are, like our true nature. And I think that's what resonates with people, you know, because deep down, we all know, underneath all the stories and all the form association, all the thoughts, everything we've learned during our human experience and who we think we are here on the stage, you know, we all know deep down that there's more going on than this. You know, so that's really all it is. And again, it's not me. It's just that when we hear something that reminds us of the wonderful truth, we tend to resonate with it, and that's wonderful.<br>Yeah, I think it is wonderful. Not only is that wonderful, but after you and I... after I found your first interview and you had your book, I got your book. I didn't read it the traditional way because you've written your book really differently than any other book I've ever seen before. You would talk about something and then put a parenthesis and reference another place that you could go where you were also talking about that subject. So I would read a line and then go to the reference and read that. It took me a couple of months to read the book because I just didn't rush through it. And there is so much wisdom. Like, I'm telling you, look, people in the comments will make comments about, "Oh, somebody's just trying to sell a book." Christian does sell his book, but he also offers it for free on his website. At least you did. I don't know if you still do.<br>Yeah, I definitely do. Yeah, it's not about the money. I just want to make it available. Exactly. But I want to tell you, first of all, if you can afford it... because people think people are making a bunch of money from this stuff, and it's just not the case. I mean, I make almost nothing from the YouTube channel. You're like, we're doing this because it's a labor of love, not because it's a big money-maker. That's right. And the same thing for you with the books. Believe me, there's not much money in publishing. But if you can afford to buy the book, I would encourage everybody watching to pick it up because of the deep, deep wisdom that I received reading it. And if you can't, then go on his website and download a copy because you are meant to have it. He's meant to share this information with the world, for sure.<br>Thank you. Thank you, for sure, for sure. So today, I want to talk about a few things, and let's start with self-love. Yeah, because there are a lot of near-death experiencers that I have spoken with and read about and watched, and it seems to be a topic that comes up an awful lot. And it must be important, then, to Spirit if people are bringing that topic back. So, would you like to speak to this and what you've come to understand about it, how it works, and what people need to know, I guess?<br><br><br>Yes, yes. So this is an extremely important topic, and it's one that I often get questions about or feel called to speak to. But I've also been very careful about how to comment on it, actually, because I'm aware that ego, that's just the part of us that's responding to fear and trying to build up a story and justify the self, ego loves when it hears things that you know prop up the identity of self. So I'm super careful not to say certain things that might just be ego candy. That being said, okay, like, okay, so what are we really? This is what this really boils down to. We are really individuated drops of the one ocean of being. So we're like pieces of God, you could say. Okay, so that's just simple words for something that vastly transcends language. But what I mean is, you are a piece of the most valuable, powerful, wonderful, precious thing, the only fundamentally real thing, actually. And you, as an individuated piece of it, are so, so, so loved, like, in a very specific, personal, understanding, deep, deep way. That is our true nature.<br>Okay, but here in the physical, we experience fear. And when we experience fear and conditioning, we end up buying into stories and beliefs that are not in alignment with that truth. We buy into negative self-perceptions that are not in alignment with that truth. For instance, like "I'm not free," or "I'm shameful," you know, "I'm not worthy of love" is another way to say that, or "I don't have any power." You know, these perceptions are just rampant on Earth. But the thing is, they're not in alignment with the fundamental truth underneath those perceptions. Underneath that obfuscation, you could say, is what you always, always are and were, and that is total unconditional love, peace, freedom, and joy.<br>Okay, so I'm putting it that way almost like in a technical way first because when I say, "You are love, and there's absolutely no reason that you can't feel deserving of all the love in the universe," I mean that in a very tangible way, not just like a philosophical, "Oh, that's nice to hear" way. No, your true nature is... okay, so I'm going to say this very carefully, and I've written this a few times, but I've never said this sentence publicly because, again, this is so big ego candy. Warning. Okay, you are what is. Okay, big ego candy there because the ego will take that and run with it. But I don't mean that at the ego level. I mean, if you look closely at your consciousness itself, how can that not be worthy? It is that which exists. You see, it's that which is. It's that which shines with... oh, this is so beyond language. Life itself, you know.<br>So because of that, it is very important that when we don't feel that, which is very common on Earth because we get lost in all these fear stories, that we at least start intellectually, you know, to tell ourselves, remind ourselves, "Wait, all this shame, all this fear, that's not who I really am." Like, you can at least think that thought to start, at least question the story, and really start to locate, "Wait, could it be true that I really am worthy? That I really have nothing to fear? That I really am free?" Oh, no, but the ego will rise up and say, "No, but look at all these reasons in your life you're not free. All these reasons that you don't have power. All these reasons that you're full of shame." You know, you've been shamed. You've been... often, it's conditioning from our childhood. So many people here experience abuse throughout their lives, to lesser or much greater degrees. You know, that's like a deep, deep conditioning we end up holding on to. It's a story we very deeply buy into, and then we seem to lose ourselves very deeply in it.<br>But the thing is, you are so worthy. You can even look at that. You can even question that. You can even feel the deepest terror associated with that negative story in order to heal it. Like, you are so totally worthy to do that. So self-love... long way around, but self-love is just the simple word we put on acknowledging what you already really are. I'm careful not to, like, in the book, I didn't say something about self-love as a specific idea because the rest of the book, I think, hopefully, lifts up the truth of what we are enough that you don't need the ego candy part of it. Do you know what I mean? But meanwhile, of course, you are worthy of everything. And often, being our authentic selves, which is not just self-service, it's actually a service to the world, that often means self-care. You see, it means taking the time to rest. It means taking the time to be alone or to nurture yourself or, very importantly, sometimes even to distance yourself from things that are not resonant with you or that are bringing you down. You're so worthy. You can draw that line in the sand. That's not an unloving thing to do, to just recognize, "Oh, this person is hurting me," or "This circumstance is hurting me. I really can shine more if I make some space, take some space from that." You know what I mean? So that is all part of the self-love idea.<br>And it's not always easy to find, you know. We really feel disempowered by the ego story and by the fear story, but we are never actually truly disempowered. And that's one of the most important things we can lift up to people. You're allowed to question that disempowering story and actually find your real self in there. It's in there somewhere, you know.<br>I love that, and I'm glad that you brought that part up about you are allowed to disconnect, you are allowed to take time for yourself because I feel like in our culture, and I don't know if it's the same around the world, but at least in the United States, there is a word that comes up when we do that that is thrown around that disempowers us from doing that, which is the word "selfish." Okay, and "lazy." Maybe lazy. Or people will tell themselves, "Well, I can't do this because then it's going to be selfish of me, and I need to give, give, give, give more." Yeah, so will you speak to that a little bit?<br><br><br>Yeah, so the old adage, you know, "You have to put on your own oxygen mask first," is very true. You can't... okay, so you can't actually serve in full capacity if you don't... if you aren't full in your own capacity. I just had someone reach out to me yesterday with a personal realization they had. I won't name them by name and embarrass them, but if they're listening, they'll know it's them. This person had the flu yesterday, and they said it suddenly occurred to them, and this is exactly directly related to your question, they realized, "Oh my gosh, I am so worthy because I am a part of that which is, and I'm allowed to even be disabled, basically, by the flu and not able to function. I'm allowed to just be the way exactly that I am." And then, when I accept it in myself, I am empowered then to help other people. You see, because it's the fullness of self is aligned with the... okay, the ocean of being is like the ultimate source of strength and power. It is strength and power. I don't mean that to sound too philosophical or abstract, but what I mean is, beingness itself is love and peace and joy and freedom, and it is so... it's the thing that gave rise to the entire physical reality, actually. Like, we think the rules of the physical reality have all the power. They don't. They're just built-in rule sets to the physical reality system. It's like it's very much subsequent to the true power, which is the power of spirit.<br>So, the reason I'm mentioning that is, when you align with who you really are, which means whatever that means for you, you know, could mean alone time, it could mean focusing on something you enjoy, it could mean setting aside time for yourself, whatever way, as you do that and as you reconnect with that true source of strength, you are empowered. Your vibration increases, and you are then able to arrive in the world in a more full and complete way. It's like... maybe a simple metaphor might be like, you can't go and help people in the world who are starving if you're not fed. You know what I mean? Like, if you don't have any strength, you can't go out and do as much. So, yes, self-care is very important, and we are allowed absolutely to make that choice to find that rejuvenation.<br>I actually made some hard choices in my own life around that topic. I was giving, giving, giving for years and years, and I got really burned out in my work. After my last employer shut down, they closed our facility. I took six months off intentionally and did not work. I didn't do anything financially productive, which was a big step for me because I'm the primary provider for our family, and I've always worked really hard my whole life. And it... you know, that was conditioning. But I purposefully was very low-functioning for six months. <br>You know, I slept a lot. I did very little productive work because I sensed intuitively that's what I needed. And I did, and I chose that. And when I did that, oh my gosh, I healed in physical ways and in other ways that I didn't even know that I needed. And it was from that place that I was then able to go and do things like publish the book, actually, and share with people. And now I work a full-time job and share in this kind of way, in this kind of capacity, that's only possible because I listened to my body and to my deeper self that was saying, "Stop, slow down, and actually rest." Like, there's not actually a reason you can't rest. I know that's not easy because we put the pressure in the rules on ourselves to not rest because we are driven in a society that values productivity, that measures success by money and by material things that really don't count.<br>So, what I'm feeling a nudge... I'm feeling a nudge here to bring up a related topic. Yes, I was going to say, bring... yeah, so, okay, so the outer world says something: "This is what you should do. This is who you are. Right, you're the worker. You earn the money. You do the thing. This is your role in certain relationships. This is what's expected of you." We learned that our whole lives, from the moment we're like two, you know. There's another voice that has a much better vantage point than the world. That voice is the deepest voice within you. Yeah, it's your soul. I mean, soul is not something else. It means the deeper you knows. So, metaphorically, the way that I've heard this put is, your higher self is like standing up on a cliff, looking out over the forest. I just got goosebumps when you said that. So, it can see the whole forest. Then you're down in the trees as the human portion of the self, and you can't see crap. All you can see is like four trees around you. And so, for you, it feels like, "Oh, I have to go this certain way for whatever reason." The higher self can see... you know, what I actually have a much better vantage point now.<br>So, this is one of the reasons why I talk so much about the idea of quality of intent as being one of the primary things we're here to do in the physical, that is, wield an intention that is more in alignment with love rather than fear in all of our choice-making. Because that also means, do you have a quality of intention that is so fearless and so aligned with love that you'll even listen to yourself, to your deepest no, really, like, instead of the world? <br>Can you listen to that little voice that says, "I should take a different path"? That's hard to do. That's hard to do, but that is a quality of intention. A whole life can be shifted in that one quality of intention to listen to that voice that really... I mean, because you kind of know, you know, like the deeper us is always kind of whispering, and we often ignore it, you know, because we think we know at the human level. We got all... look, I can think really hard, and I can think, understand all these things around me, and there's value in that. But the deeper portion of you has a better vantage point, and when we actually listen to it, it actually kind of opens the door to it, by the way, because as we listen to it, it's like saying, "Yeah, I'm listening," and then the deeper part will say, "Oh, wonderful. Here's more. Here's more."<br>And I didn't know that's what I was doing by following my own intuition in these matters. Like, for instance, I didn't share my story for eight years or so after it came back to me. I was having out-of-body experiences. I did not share. I didn't want the... you know, the attention. I didn't want the negative response, you know, that just comes with the territory. But five or six years ago, I really felt this nudge, like, "The ground is just fertile enough. Like, it's just fertile enough where this could really help." You know, and so I decided, like, "There's a personal cost, but what am I afraid of? I'm not even human. What am I afraid of? <br>My reputation is going to be tarnished or something? Like, that's silly." Do you know what I mean? Like, yeah, really listening to that. So, listening to that, when you say yes, it's like, "Oh, you're saying yeah, you're listening," and then another door opens, and another door opens. And now I can't imagine going... I mean, I can't go back in the closet now. Now I'm just who I am. I mean, I'm a normal person too, okay, but I also can't help but constantly sense this layer of deeper spiritual reality that's always going on. Like, I have this energetic sense that is always on, and so I can't really turn that off, you know.<br>So, now I love to arrive in the way that is most hopefully the most authentic and present and joyful and maybe direct, you know, but I also try to be aware, of course, of where people are. I try to listen and be discerning about that. I'm just saying that I'm no longer afraid, and that's a wonderful, powerful place to be coming from.<br>Thank you. It's so empowering, and you don't even have to do a bunch of things, by the way. That something else just feels like it wants to come out. Like, it's not like that means you have to go affect 10,000 people. No, it's just... it just be yourself, man. Like, live the life that you want to live. Live the life you want to live. I know you have all these good reasons... I'm not putting aside all the good reasons that we have that we can't choose. I mean, we are under incredible constraints here: financial constraints, biological constraints, health constraints, societal constraints, political constraints, the very constraints of the physical reality itself—linear time and discrete location. All these things we take for granted. I mean, there's so much that we're constrained within, so to speak, you know, within the simulation. That doesn't matter, actually. What matters is what you're choosing, the quality of what you're choosing, and why.<br>Yeah, it's beautiful. Well, that's super powerful, and I feel like it sounds like what you're saying is that you've learned how to listen to your intuition more over time. So, for the people that are watching, what can they do to better listen to and maybe even trust their own intuition?<br><br><br>So, first, I just... something else that I felt like I should mention when you said that... I'm a very, like, historically intellectual person, and so for the very... by design, by plan, by... well, it's definitely a part of the plan. So, I just mean that, like, I... 15 years ago, my ego took pride in this idea that I was a thinker or something. It means almost nothing I know now. That means almost nothing, but I'm just saying that for those who are intellectually minded, I applaud the power of intellect. In fact, I seek personally. I feel very, very, very passionate about bridging the world of the local intellect with the deeper self and its incredible wisdom. I'm very passionate about those two sides of the Grand Canyon. They're not actually separate. They're one thing, but they feel like they're two sides of the Grand Canyon when we're associated with thought. So, I'm just lifting that up because this is not like, "Oh, just throw at everything." You know, no, this is... I am all about like, we need to be reasoned, reason-focused. This is a very reasonable unfolding, an investigation of reality that we're talking about. You know, follow your reason, basically. Don't even accept anything I say or anything anybody else says if it doesn't align with your reason. Just listen to your reason, you know what I mean? Trust that.<br><br><br>Okay, anyway, that being said, to your question, the thing I would lift up actually is meditation, even though this may not sound directly related. The reason I lift it up is because when we are really deeply associated with the constant thought stream, we can't see clearly. So, the intuition gets drowned out by the loud noise of the river of the constant thoughts and the constant stories. If we take up a consistent, long-term meditation practice, and we are genuine, you know, and we arrive with quality of intention that is to truly investigate what I am beneath thought and to truly kind of regain control of focus, even just doing that, it's hard to start. As we do that, it creates this beautiful space, and the larger part of our self rises up on its own. That larger self contains much more than just subtle intuitive knowing, actually. Not to get too stimulating to the ego, but it also can mean non-physical experiences, out-of-body experiences. Like, a few months after I started meditating, I had my first non-physical experience. It was super eye-opening. There was no going back, you know what I mean? I had no expectation of that at all, but that's just how it is when we really deeply set aside thought and return with full alertness, full clarity, to this deep, beautiful present moment.<br>As we gain in familiarity with the depth of that present moment, the intuitive self becomes quite clear because, basically, this is a process of accepting everything in yourself and saying yes to life, all of life. Okay, even including the difficulties that you may have had internally. As we say yes to everything, that also means you say yes to the intuition. It's like it's waiting for you to say yes. It's waiting for you to not be afraid of the dark closet anymore because, as you say okay to the dark closet, you're actually saying okay to everything, including this deeper guidance.<br>Thank you. I think that's really helpful for people who are watching, and I want to add a caveat to the meditation message. So, if you're one of the people watching like me who have not been able to meditate, tried all kinds of things, I tried meditating when I woke up after nine hours of sleep and still fell asleep. What has worked for me is what I call a walking meditation, where I am in nature, and I think that's really the key to this. And you just focus on your surroundings and not on your thoughts, and you walk, and you're purposeful, and you're enjoying, and just bringing in the vibration of nature. And I think that you can reach meditative states similar to what Christian is talking about without having to sit down, close your eyes, and try to have a practice that maybe doesn't work for you. So, it's almost like a baby step, and maybe that'll help you to get to the other place, or maybe you never will. It doesn't matter. I just don't want people to be turned off because meditation hasn't necessarily worked for them.<br>Yeah, no, that's a fantastic comment. A word for what you just described is mindfulness. I love that. Yeah, and meditation is synonymous with mindfulness, actually. It's just typically means a process where mindfulness is actualized through some process, which is whether you close your eyes in your inner room or whether you're intentionally doing that while you're walking. Yeah, because I mean, think of... here's another way to put this: meditation is about alertness and being present with what is here because what's truly here is consciousness. Okay, but until you locate that, it looks like all that's here is an environment and some thoughts and some feelings, you know. Yeah, so you don't get to the backdrop by creating a new thought. You get to the backdrop by being so alert that you see exactly what's here now, exactly what you're feeling, exactly the trees in nature, exactly listen to the bird singing.<br>Excellent. Well, since we're talking about being awake, being present, being mindful, can we talk about this Great Awakening that seems to be part of most discussions that I'm hearing about right now? And I'd love to get your thoughts and wonder if you have any memories that this was part of why you chose to come in when you came in.<br><br><br>Well, I'll at least say that I was very much aware that this was the Awakening Act of the play in my pre-birth experience. It was just kind of known. It was like, it was just like the act of the play. I don't know how else to describe it. It was just known. It was like, "Okay, this is the very beginning of the Awakening Act," and I knew like I was born in 1980, and I could even, even in my pre-birth experience, I remember reviewing a lot of things in a numerical way. I'm interested in structure, and numbers are easy, so I remember knowing like it was kind of starting very, very early, starting in the '80s and '90s, but I remember knowing it would be more like in my 20s, 30s, and 40s that it would be picking up. But it was also more like a probabilistic... how do I put this? Like, everything is... the pre-life review is probabilistic, so it was obvious that the direction is towards Awakening. It wasn't necessarily crystal clear like the degree to which the Awakening might successfully unfold. There's more or less degree, but it was definitely moving in that direction. I could see that clearly.<br>And now that, you know, now that I'm here as an energetically sensitive person, I'm aware of it. It's happening. You can feel it in the collective consciousness that consciousness is shifting very quickly right now. It's also a lot of friction going on right now. You and I kind of talked about that before we started recording. There's thousands of years of this old, you know, fear-based conditioning that we're working through. That's... we got... we have a lot of fear, and when we have a lot of fear and a lot of ego and a lot of old beliefs that we're holding on to, those things can seem tenacious in the short term, and they can cause a lot of friction as we wrestle with them. <br>I mean, our whole society is built on... not our whole society, but many, many aspects of our society are built on some of those old fear-based patterns, like us-versus-them thinking, you know, competition of my group versus your group, my group at the expense of your group, you know, judging one group of people over the other because, "Look, now my group has strength, and I... you know, because I judged yours," or something like it's very basic, crude stuff here. Like, even just like sexual freedom or the equality of certain groups, like the sexes, like we haven't even learned that yet. I mean, we're still working on that. That's very basic stuff, whereas the truth of our nature is so connected, and it's so wise in love and in the thousands and thousands of expressions of love that love can mean.<br>We have a long way to go, but we are definitely pointed in the direction of working past the old towards that deeper true nature. Like, we can't help but get there eventually. It might be more or less tumultuous along the way, maybe even very tumultuous potentially, but overall, I think we are succeeding, and we have an incredible amount of help in the non-physical.<br>When you say we have an incredible amount of help, tell me what you mean by that.<br>Yeah, I mean, we have many, many guides and other friends in the non-physical who are helping to nudge in small ways. Okay, there's... not to get too strange-sounding here, but there are energetic realities that precede the physical reality, and we're all connected to those, and there's a lot of work that happens there in thought space and in the energy space of humanity. And so, the collective consciousness... yes, the collective consciousness environment is like an energy. <br>Think of like a pond of energy within a much bigger ocean of energy, something like that. And in the pond, the pond's temperature is like increasing slowly, but even a small, even a tenth of a degree increase is like a big deal when you have this dense of a pond, you know what I'm saying? And within that pond, then our non-physical friends, they can see very clearly. Well, we can't see super clearly at the human level, so they're able to identify like... we'll just call it forks or energetic nudges that could be provided that might help here and there, and they can encourage us individually in personal ways that are meaningful and uplift the individual, yeah, or the collective, actually.<br>But during that almost entire explanation, I got my spirit signal that I get, which is I have this crazy thing that happens in my left ear only where it's like the hair stands on end, like you know how your hair stands up when you're cold. That's what that feels like to me, and whenever that happens, I am hearing a truth. Like, it's happened several times, but it happened for a very long duration while you were explaining that. So, people, go back, rewind, listen to that again. It's funny. I felt some... not to be too strange here, but I felt some guide nudges like, "Don't say it like it's fine, but like if they're trying to say like a bunch at once, I only have like 10 words I can use." But it's simply that we have a lot of help, and that we are loved, and that we cannot fail. That's like the energy of their support.<br>Fail? What do you mean we cannot fail? Like, this can't... this will not fail because it's not... I didn't... I didn't say that the... I didn't... okay, so I'm not even saying that the stage play won't necessarily have major catastrophe. It might. I don't... I'm not predicting any end-of-the-world stuff or anything like that. I'm just saying that the truth is what's first, and the truth is meant to come out. Well, what I'm saying is the truth is the truth of spirit, the truth of being, okay? And in that, there can't be failure. It already is the thing that's most real. It already is complete, total freedom, love, peace, and joy, and that's who we are. So, the reason I say we can't fail is... you can't actually fail in your life, and that's very, very freeing. Like, you can't fail. Like, you're going to be fine, and you will be so loved and respected. It's good. It's fine. <br>Meanwhile, by you can't fail, I mean, it's all utilized by spirit for the growth of love ultimately, even if there's some local... that might happen like in the worst... I'm not saying I have any sense that this is going to happen, but even if the world were to physically end, it's not... I know that sounds like end-of-the-world, right? That's like the worst thing we can imagine, right? It's actually not a big deal. Like, what I mean... so crazy to hear you say, but I know what you mean. Like, what I mean is, we are the players. We're the consciousness having the experience. It'd be like if, you know, 78 billion players logged into a Minecraft server, and then someone blew up all the blocks, and everybody returned to being in their video game rooms. It's not really a big deal. In fact, you go, "Oh, that was pretty crazy. That was exciting," but you weren't actually harmed.<br>Now, of course, here in the physical, we feel that's... that's the difference, of course. The difference is that here in the physical, we feel threatened. We feel harmed because we feel real pain, right? I know that it doesn't actually change what I'm saying because the depth of being is deeper than any of the pain. And I'm not making light of the pain. I'm not making light of the terrible, terrible torment that is experienced on Earth. I'm not... oh my gosh, I'm not. But I'm just saying that the field in which that experience is occurring is deeper. The movie screen on which the movie is playing is first. It's so... no matter what happens in the movie, the screen can't be hurt. It can't fail, and the screen is consciousness itself, spirit itself.<br>So, there's an incredible freedom in that because, as we hear the message, "You can't fail," it frees us to not... because the thing is, when we're carrying around this burden, maybe now it's a new burden that we call, "Oh, now I have to be spiritual and behave a certain way," we can throw the burden stuff away, honestly. Like, that's what this Awakening actually is about. You could say that the Awakening is like a deep unburdening.<br>I like that a lot. I feel that deeply. I like that a lot, and I really, really love the message because this has again come up over and over again with people who've had near-death experiences, is that your soul cannot be harmed. And then people in the comments write, "Well, what about the pain? I can still have this. I can still have that." But you had a very specific memory of creating a life in which you would experience a very specific kind of pain for the purpose of... I know, I... again, ego starts to step in, and so I'm careful with how I'm wording this... where you would... I'm going to use the word "expand your soul" in a certain way, refine... I'm going to use the word "refine," yeah, refine your soul in a certain way by having that experience of pain. And for people who are watching who have not watched your account of your pre-birth memory, will you speak a little bit because I know there are a lot of people that talk about this so much in the comments about the pain part? Yeah, and about how the pain is actually happening, I'm going to call it, for us and not to us.<br><br><br>Absolutely. Well, first, just a small, tiny technical correction: I didn't... it's not that I created the life. It's that this life was an opportunity that was available, and I reviewed it in detail, and I tweaked it, but I could see all that it meant. And it meant the likely complete traumatization of my human self through health issues, especially one in my early 20s, that would completely crush me and cause an incredible amount of pain, which did come true. Yeah, that happened. So, the thing is... okay, so here... okay, so here's the thing. Okay, this is... I know this sounds like, "Oh, it sounds so trite and easy." No, this is super, super powerful, and I'll actually start with a Bashar comment: "Circumstances don't matter; only state of being matters." Okay, so in the case of pain, it is not actually about whether or not you are experiencing pain. The question is what you do, how you respond, and what you choose, what quality of intention, which means what kind of choice-making, like the real why, the real choice-making, how, what quality of choice-making do you bring into that context? Do you accept it, or do you reject and rant and rave, as an example? Do you choose to try to serve the person next to you in a small way, or perhaps do you choose to enjoy the sunlight coming in the window anyway? <br>Do you choose to run away from the meaning that the pain might prompt? Like, it might prompt... I know, in my case, the meaning was really deep. It was like, "I'm powerless to escape suffering. I'm powerless to escape agony." That powerlessness was like the biggest thing for me because the largest chunk of the negative we're experiencing on Earth isn't the pain; it's the suffering, which is the word I'm using for the negative meaning that we're putting on it and the way that we respond to it, basically rejection and fear. Fear and rejection is hell. Fear is hell, okay? And so, it's just that the pain, when it rises up, it often prompts a story immediately. It happens so fast we don't even catch it. This is one of the reasons meditation is so important, by the way, because we miss this like half a tenth of a millisecond between when the headache starts and when we think, "Oh, here is my powerlessness again," or whatever the negative story is, you know? Or maybe it's, "Oh, I could have a brain tumor. That would be worst-case." Like, I'm not making light of that. It's okay that that thought arises. I'm just pointing out that we react so quickly to the physical, including pain, that we don't even notice our own meaning and the way that we're relating to it.<br>So, can we bring more alertness and acceptance into that? And then, can we be more intentional with how we meet it and how we frame it, what story we buy into about it? We don't... but you don't even need a story. Like, what quality of being do you arrive with? (Parenthesis: That can happen whether you have pain or not. Parenthesis: That can happen whether or not you're bedridden or not.) Like, I've gone through all sorts of chronic illness in this life and incredible amounts of pain, and I've been debilitated and disabled many times, sometimes for short durations and sometimes for longer durations. And for a long time, I wrestled with a perception of powerlessness and feeling like, "If I can't do the things I need to do, that means something negative about me." That is actually not true, but in order to find that, I had to be willing to actually feel what I feel. I had to be willing to actually face the deepest, deepest layers of that fear.<br>So, all that is to say that pain, when it arises, is actually an offering in a similar way to how you might say a weight on a weight bench is an offering. It's heavy, okay? It hurts. It hurts. It's heavy. It's another way of saying it's heavy, right? But the question is whether or not it's heavy. It's actually not evil. It's just heavy. It's just heavy. It's just arriving. Now, here's the thing: in your experience, it's arriving. It's heavy. The question is, do you lift it, and how do you lift it? That's the only thing you have to worry about, and that lifting is about how you choose to meet it in this moment. Don't worry about the whole thing. This moment is all there ever is. Just in this moment, how... what is the quality of being that you bring forward into whatever has arisen now?<br>Ironically, interestingly, as we fully accept the negative and the pain, it tends to heal. You see, it tends to actually be released and relinquished and integrated because, once we integrate that, there doesn't... there's not actually a value to the weight anymore. So, it's not... it doesn't have a manifestation... nudge like the same that it would have if we... you know, if you hadn't had that. Like, Tom Campbell has a very direct way of saying this. He says something, and people... the ego doesn't like this either, but he... I've heard him say, "This reality gives you what you fear." Well, that sounds terrible, right? No, it's not about tormenting you. It's simply about identifying the part of your experience that you haven't yet integrated, helping you to see the fear that still is there so you can face it and process it. Fear is just one word, but it can have all sorts of different tentacles. What is the nature of the rejection, you know? Basically, so if something rises up, what part of yourself is it inviting you to heal? It's a process, and in that way, pain is not happening to you; it's happening for you. And when the physical life is over, and you look back, you can see, "Wow, that was a heck of a ride. Wow, that was intense. <br>Wow, that was hard," and then you can see the magic, the power of even just a small... like, we might think a small bit of love or a small bit of acceptance doesn't do very much. It does a ton. Like, if you are really under a heavy weight, and you really, in this moment, feel what you're feeling, and take ownership for your own crap, and accept this present moment, and whatever love can mean... love can mean a thousand things versus all the things fear can mean, and you can intuit the difference because I'm not labeling it as one type of behavior. I'm saying you can intuit the difference. As you do that, a small action here is like a thousand miles in spirit because we have become super leveraged, you could say, by the density of the physical. And in the leverage of the density, the quality of the choices we can bring forth are that much more potent, and that's why expansion happens so quickly here, as they... as you've probably heard said in your death experiences.<br>Okay, that was a big tangent, but hopefully I spoke... no, it was crazy. Just that there's just so much that oozes out of this. One of the things that really caught my attention was towards the end when you said, "A small action here is like a thousand miles in spirit," and we didn't say what kind of action that was. The action is the quality of intention that is in alignment with love and rather than fear in whatever... whatever that means for you. <br>So, it could mean... and I don't want to pigeonhole because what happens is when people hear that, they think, "Oh, there's a new behavior," and it's not just about a behavior. This is about a quality of intention, which means behavior, okay, but it doesn't always mean the same behavior. Like, you have to feel what is the most true way you can meet this moment, and that could mean acceptance. It could mean owning your own selfishness. Maybe your spouse has ticked you off, and you actually say, "You know what? Maybe I am a little bit to blame for this." That's not easy for the ego. The ego doesn't like that, but the ego is arising from fear, and it's an act of facing fear when you actually look inside yourself and say, "Wow, maybe I am being kind of a jerk," you know, or "Maybe I really am to blame for some of this," or "Maybe I really can improve." You know what I mean? Like, that shift, that quality of a shift, when you're under this much weight, is a big deal.<br>Wow, this is really important stuff. Like, it is really important stuff because we don't talk about... like, we don't teach our kids this in school. This is one of the things I feel like, as a small person, I would have liked to know, having come to Earth, like, "Oh, right, thank you for reminding me," because we all kind of know anyway, but if we had that awareness... and again, it's not just like... like, really, what I'm talking about ultimately is, can you fully align with your full self because your full self is love and peace and freedom and joy? It's not fear. It's not the negative self-perceptions that this life seemed to have proved to you. <br>That's... they're not even fundamentally real. They're not even true. Can you locate that? And then, if we do that, we unshackle each other to the incredible power of our higher nature. Like, that is the real power. Like, we're all focused on the physical and the money and moving the objects around, who has more objects today, and how many rocks are over here versus over here. That entire thing is subsequent to the power of spirit. It's nothing compared to the real thing, which is consciousness itself. And you always have a choice of how you arrive.<br>Yeah, and you remember the love on the other side. I've also spoken about this too because I, too, have been on the other side where the only thing that we were was this incredible, powerful love. It was like take the vibration, the power of like a jackhammer, but make it the smoothness of a hummingbird wing, and take the most beautiful note that you have ever heard, and move that out into eternity, infinity, a trillion... that was what we were, was that love, that vibration. And it's just... I don't have any human words other than I try and do the best I can to describe it, but it pales in comparison to what we are. <br>I mean, truly, if you look at what this channel is about, it is waking you up to the power of your soul, and nothing about that has anything to do with fear. And I think one of the things that bothers me the most doing and having a channel like this is reading the comments, and over and over again, I'm somebody making me cry because over and over again, I feel like people are so stuck in their pain, and they're so stuck in their fear that they have forgotten that they are love. They have forgotten the power of what they are. And in the comments, I see people talking about hell and fear and damnation and judgment, and it just makes me so sad because we've lost sight of what we are. We just don't remember, and part of by the design, we put on the veil, and we come here to have this experience, and that's intentional. But the more that we can wake up and remember what we really and truly are, the more it evolves your life into being able to... and we're going to talk about this in a second because it's kind of me bridging us into manifestation.<br>And when I'm talking about manifestation, I really don't mean manifesting a million dollars or manifesting your dream vacation, although those things can bring you happiness. It's more about manifesting the true joy that is your birthright.<br><br><br>Amen. Yes, it is a quality of being and, therefore, a quality of life, right? Okay, so like, even the following sentence sounds like sacrilege on Earth because there's so many pissed-off egos running around: "Life is not your enemy." Which is... say that, Christian, because the thing that people keep saying is, "I'm not coming back here. I'm doing this life, and I'm not coming back here." But I think, on a soul level, it's our greatest joy to come back again. So, you know, so saying you don't... okay, so this is a bigger topic, but quick, and I love everything you said, by the way. You know, like the age-old adage, "Don't read the comments." I know, I know, but I have sometimes. I read the comments. No, but you know what though? It is hurtful because when you're open... when you're open, being connected to Spirit is about being open. It is about vulnerability. It is vulnerability. It's like it is synonymous with vulnerability. So, it means that the ego action of another, which might be very small—maybe all they did is post a comment, like, whatever, whatever simple comment—to them, it was like a two-second quick ego hit for like a second, but it can really hurt, you know, if you're vulnerable.<br>Meanwhile, though, as we awake, we also are allowed to see, and this is not a judgment, this is not judgment, but we can see just very plainly, "Oh, that's just ego. It's just they're hurting." And how many times have we been hurting, and we hurt someone else inadvertently, of course, all the time, you know what I mean? An ego all the time. An ego is... put it this way: ego itself is sleep. Like, alertness is the... like, that's why the move towards meditation is towards alertness because alertness is closer to what we really are. It's full, full consciousness, high consciousness, high degree of consciousness. Ego is like someone says something mean to you, and you just feel angry right away, and you're asleep in the angry thought. You don't even have control at a certain level. You do have control, but it feels like there's a loss of control because you're kind of asleep in this little pattern. Actually, every single thought is like a little sleep, actually. But anyway, I'm just saying that because it can help at least a bit to identify, "Oh, no, this is just my brother or sister who is hurt." And I... I get hurt sometimes. That's hurt. Yes, exactly. Another part of yourself that's hurt. <br>So, if the other part of yourself is hurt, do you need to be hurt too? No, that doesn't actually help them. Yeah, if I hit my thumb with a hammer, I don't need to go hit my toe too. Well, like, if you hit your thumb with a hammer, I can feel compassion for you, but I also don't have to lose my peace because the thing is, I... love is about celebration of joy and freedom. That's... I don't know how to describe this very specific angle of energy I'm trying to describe. I'm simply saying that we don't have to be pulled down into all the pain and all the terror. Maybe it's a one-ego comment on YouTube, but maybe it's all the news that's just rife with like, "Ooh, ego stimulation." Ego stimulations: one person made a terrible decision, and now 10 million people are hearing about it. <br>Doesn't... there's nobody scared now. Watch my commercial, you know? That's not helpful. That's not... no, but I'm saying that because like, we've normalized, you know, the itch, the fear itch. "Watch my fear-based news. Now you're really going to pay attention because fear sells, and then you're going to watch my commercial, and we're going to earn the money." And we think that's winning, but it's not winning because now 10 million creative, powerful beings are focusing in a negative direction. Anyway, I'm simply saying that, okay, as we awaken, we take full responsibility for the world, actually. Okay, even as we don't have to lose our peace to what is arising. It's not actually helpful.<br>Yeah, I mean, that's the simplest way I can think to put that. No, I think that's a fantastic clarification. So, manifestation was your question. I told... sorry. Yeah, no, no, no, there's no... I'll just make one comment that connects to that. So, the physical reality is... I know this sounds like a tall order because we're like materialists because we think matter is all there is, right? Physical reality is a probabilistic simulation. It's not actually a tangible thing. It's not a fundamentally objective thing. That probabilistic simulation, our reality, has firm rules, some pretty darn dense, very precise firm rules. However, those rules include probability. They include a probabilistic way for how reality unfolds. Okay, as you align with your true nature and unshackle from fear, or even as you focus into fear too, but whatever direction you're focusing, you could just put it very simply: you're nudging the probabilities in that direction. <br>And as you align with your true power, that is disproportionately powerful because the reality is basically built for you to grow in love. Like, it's made for it. Reality is built for you to grow in love, yes, and joy and peace and freedom, and your true nature to deepen. Your true nature is love, peace, joy, and freedom, and the reality is here so that can deepen. So, when you actually choose to face your crap for real—I'm not talking pretend; I'm talking for real—the whole thing we're talking about is like the for-real when you like for-real face your crap or for-real make the loving choice, the universe responds because it's made for that unfolding.<br>Oh my God, I feel so much energy right now. It's crazy. It's made for that unfolding, so it's going to... so built into the way that it manifests is the probability room, the wiggle room for things to shift. And so, that's why, you know, when people say that they're really aligned with themselves and their passion, synchronicity just starts happening. Yeah, because the universe just... that's because I think that's like the natural way things should be working. <br>Now, on Earth, we have dampened the crap out of synchronicity because, you know, we're focused on the news and the brain and the... we're focused on the conditioning and on the small pattern. We're a bunch of creative beings who are like stuck like when you were talking about the hell comments. Oh my gosh, that brings me so much pain too because, for me, the greatest disservice is that we are... okay, we're all pieces of God, okay? Very powerful, creative beings. The disservice is now you've got millions and millions of those thinking they don't have power, thinking they don't have freedom, thinking they don't have worth. <br>That is the crime. Yeah, the crime is that we have like fallen asleep into these really, really low-vibration thought patterns, and that's why this is so important because this is a part of the Awakening. A part of the Awakening is in the intellectual space of, "Wait, no, we're going to disarm that old fear-based stuff." What about hell? What if I'm going to burn in hell forever? Well, that's a pretty scary-ass belief we... sorry, my language... that we created. We created that, and certain power structures may have been involved—not going to get into that now—but it's like the worst thing we can imagine within a spectrum of duality because we believe in duality. We believe in hot and cold, up and down, left and right as being the fundamental thing. So, they're so... wow, what about this idea of eternal torture? That's like the worst, right? The belief itself is the disservice. That it's so painful to believe that it's disempowering.<br>Like, I remember someone close to me recently... there was someone close to me who I respect very deeply, and they happen to have a certain belief tradition, and they said, "I have fear of God," and they said it in a way that is... because, you know, that's written in the Bible: "All wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord." But if we even don't... because, okay, I'm so passionate about this, I feel like I might burst. Unconditional love is the first thing. It's first, man, and I will always... I will die on that hill of unconditional love, not conditional love. And that small difference between unconditional love versus conditional love, we have religions built on that. <br>Yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now, I'm not dissing the religions because I enjoy... I grew up in a religious tradition. I take joy in going to church still. I do. It's simply that we don't need to disempower ourselves anymore, guys. And it takes a lot of bravery to turn back. Like, let's say you were brought up with that belief. It takes a heck of a lot of bravery to turn and face something where you think that if you face it, you think if you change your beliefs, you might burn in hell. That takes a lot of courage. Yeah, this is the place we do that. Yeah, this is the place where we can actually have a belief in something like eternal hell and then actually turn and say, "You know what? I don't know if that's right. You did that. God's love is unconditional. <br>What if God's love is unconditional?" Yeah, that is the most important message we could bring forward. Yeah, because you can't have... how can you have conditions on anything to judge anything if it's supposed to be unconditional? It just doesn't make sense. Unconditional is not unwise. When I say God's love is unconditional... when I say God... okay, God is just a word. I don't even care about that word. Source, the Great I Am, whatever word we want to use. I'm just clarifying that because I'm not just speaking about like the religious character of God, though I don't mind the word. I personally like the word, but I know many people get to think you have an issue with the word. <br>Okay, that thing is unconditional love, and that unconditional love is incredibly wise, incredibly intelligent. Like, you wouldn't even believe the universe-shattering, individual, ego-shattering, ego-obliterating power of what we're talking about. That loves you unconditionally, even knowing it all. That's what we're talking about, man, and that is the most wonderful, holy thing that we can share with each other. I am so passionate about this. That's a mic-drop. Like, what else can we even talk about after? What else can we... exactly. Honestly, seriously, that is the most important message.<br>Unconditional Love and Fearlessness<br>
Where Christian passionately defends unconditional love as the core of existence, rejecting fear-based beliefs like hell, urging courage to embrace this truth, and linking it to the Awakening as a reclaiming of our fearless, loving essence.<br>I love it. I do. I think so too. It's about the empowerment and remembering that we are all part of all of that. Like, basically, another way to summarize that entire thing is, you do not need to be afraid. And if you think you do, and you're afraid that there's a reason you must be afraid, fear too. Go find out. It's okay, but you don't have... it's your choice. You could do whatever you like. Well, take in what resonates and let go what doesn't. That's what I tell everybody when they write the comments: "Take in what resonates with you and let go because it's not meant for you right now if it doesn't resonate. Maybe it never will be. Maybe you'll come back to it later. It doesn't matter. Yeah, what's true for you is true for you. Right? We're all in our own place in our long soul journeys, but we all also understand love, even if we don't remember that we do. Even if we've been traumatized all heck and we're all scar tissue now, okay, psychologically, underneath it, we all resonate with love and the truth.<br>Wow. Let that... like, basically, are you brave enough to listen to that? That's it. That's what this is about. That's what the walk in the physical is about. Which brings me... thank you for that perfect segue, Christian, to how people can find you, how they can learn more, how they can connect. So, want to talk about that?<br><br><br>Yeah, so my website is awalkinthephysical.com. The book is available for free at the third link down on the book page to be read online. It's also on Amazon in print or Kindle or audiobook. I'm very passionate... you did an audiobook? I did. I recorded it myself on this very mic, and it was not... it's a great mic, by the way. Thanks. It's just a mic, but it took a lot of work to get it to the audiobook to record properly. But I felt very impassioned. It was funny. I was going for a walk, and I felt this intuitive love, a nudge because when you really listen to Spirit, sometimes you get some stuff that's like kind of shocking, and it was like, "Audiobook," and I'm like, "What?" Like, so I just... I spent two... this is before I went back to work...<br>I spent two weeks and did nothing but focus on the audiobook. Took a sound tech friend of mine 13 hours to get one audio sample to pass, even with all of his equipment that I borrowed because their quality requirements are so high. Anyway, wow. Right, so just going down a tangent, but anyway, I'm happy also to try to respond to emails, but I get a lot of emails, so if I can't respond, I apologize, but it's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a> I am happy to connect with whom I can. I also work a full-time job like you do, so life is busy, but one of the greatest blessings of sharing in this way is I've met so many amazing awakened people. I know we are awakening, and the number is growing. And when you go to someplace like the IONS conference where we saw each other a few months ago, you could feel it. Like, there's so much love there. It's ludicrous.<br>Well, let's talk about that real quick. So, we're in these videos live in perpetuity. This is 2025, January 2025, when we're recording this, and in August of 2025, they will have the IONS conference in Chicago. Christian has been asked to speak at it. I decided not to apply, but I will be there at least for some if not the whole thing. And it is such... if you're looking for amazing, mind-blowing conversations, if you're looking for content to listen to and to raise your vibration, like, there is an actual physical feeling while you're there of an increased vibration. I think all of us who are sensitive to that felt that. Oh, yes. Yeah, for sure. That's amazing.<br>Well, Christian, I can't tell you how much I appreciate you. You have been a part of my journey. You have been part of where I am and what I'm doing, and I just feel grateful. I feel grateful that we've been able to meet in real person. Yes, to doing these conversations, and conversations feed my soul. Amen. They feed my soul too. That's why I love doing this. Thank you very much for sharing it because this is like... this is the real work. Like, what I mean is, reminding each other, "Oh, you don't have to be afraid. You can be your full self, man, even here." Yeah, encouraging each other, like doing that here in the physical, and then that causes a change in mind space, and that facilitates the Awakening. <br>And that's what I know that's what you said you're interested in doing, and if your calling is yes, this is how we do that, you know. And then for those who listen to this video and they might share with one person, that little ripple in the pond... it doesn't even need to be the whole human race, guys. It's just like one ripple. Oh, that's what it's all about. And so, I'm really honored to be able to share with you.<br>Thank you. Oh, thank you, and I just thank so much everybody for watching. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Our pre-birth stories? So, when I was up until the age of like five, I had some pre-birth memory. It was there; it was normal. I assumed everybody knew we weren’t really from here. I took up a long-term meditation practice at the age of 30, and after a few months, began to have out-of-body experiences and had this rebirth memory return. And when I did that, I had the most holy moment of my whole life arrive to me. This is so beyond language, and I just have to say that about all this—like, there’s no language for any of this. I get it. But I felt my being expanded back out, and The Great I Am of all things—what we call God—and God said to me, “Are you ready to shine? Shine bright!”<br>Hi everyone, welcome back! I’m Michael Sandler, your host on Inspire Nation. If you’ve ever wondered why you came here and if you really chose to, then do we have the pre-birth experiences, a walk in the physical show for you today. I’ll be talking with Christian Sundberg, pre-birth experience expert and author of a brilliant book on the subject, A Walk in the Physical. And that’s just what I want to talk with him about today—about how and why we ended up here now, out-of-body experiences, and if we can all access our pre-birth memories. So, welcome to the show, Christian. And you are not a meat suit, but are you ready to shine?<br>Yes, sir, very much so. I appreciate that intro that we recorded before the recording here—that you are not a meat suit. The show? Yes, indeed, we are not just the meat suit. So, since we are not—we’ve established this fact—we are not just our meat suit. How important are our pre-birth experiences or pre-birth stories?<br>Well, you know, it really depends on the individual. And you know, we come to be veiled, so it’s one of those things where we’re kind of here to play the human from the human perspective. So, it’s not always the case that I feel there’s this huge personal benefit to knowing the pre-birth plan fully. But we can, you know, when we let go enough of the form, the non-physical content is there. And I want to dive into pre-birth experiences, pre-birth stories, and how we can learn about them.<br>But you said we came here to be veiled, and people talk about 3D, 5D—I joke, 7D—you know, all these different dimensions. The shift we’re going through—is this part of the evolution of consciousness? Do we need to always be veiled here in the earth school? Because it seems like kids are coming in more awake, more aware, and without forgetting.<br>That’s an excellent question. So, technically speaking, this level of density requires some level of veiling because of the nature of the density. However, as our vibration increases—that means as we process out old fear patterns and old form associations—it is natural, yes, of course, that as that vibration increases, we become increasingly familiar with who and what we really are. So, I love it that there are more coming in who have pre-birth awareness or, really, just that all of us are beginning to get more and more glimpses of who we really are in various forms—out-of-body experiences or other types of experiences. It’s becoming increasingly normal. That’s because the vibration of the human collective consciousness is changing; it’s increasing.<br><br><br>Have you had personally out-of-body experiences? Yes, sir, yes. What have they been like? What can you tell us about it? And then we’ll get to the pre-birth stories, but it’s something that’s really fascinating for people today.<br>Yes, so, okay, it’s really difficult to describe at times because we tend to think of reality in terms of physical environments. And our larger nature is much bigger than that. But there are so—I have had experiences of environments that are far more rich and lucid and real than anything on Earth. The colors are like a thousand times or more rich and real and alive, and you can feel that they’re a part of you. And you can—oh my gosh, how do you describe this? I mean, without making it sound too crazy, but even just looking at one blade of grass—you know, I remember in one out-of-body experience, looking at this blade of grass in this beautiful heavenly environment and being like, “Oh my gosh, like, I could spend all day just looking at this blade of grass, and I would feel fulfilled.” That’s how beautiful and how full of life even one blade of grass is. So, yes, they’re very real.<br>Well, it’s interesting. After my first near-death experience, I saw light in a different way and became a photographer for many years. I had photos in older Colorado art galleries and all sorts of different places. And it started by looking at a blade of grass in the morning and seeing dew on it and seeing the fractal reflection of all of the different colors. And I just started to cry looking at the blade of grass.<br>Yeah, that’s how, as we see reality with alertness and presence, it’s not even about the size. It’s just that the beauty of spirit shines through because of alertness and presence. And so, even a blade of grass can—yeah, of course, it can be truly moving. Anything, actually, when met with full presence, alertness, non-resistance, and openness, we will experience that because we have shifted.<br>Oh, that’s fascinating. I again want to get to your pre-birth story, and at the same time, without resistance. So, I told you that I’m having this show tonight about the supposed drones in New Jersey and everything going on. It seems like we’re birthed into or brought into or indoctrinated—maybe that’s the word—into a world that gives us resistance so that we can’t see beyond the wall or see beyond the veil to see the other side because we’re so busy in this struggle or fear-based state.<br>Yeah, yeah. Fear is a very low vibration, and when we associate into fear—and even when we simply deeply form-associate in general—that means when we deeply associate with thoughts or sensory experience or bodily experience, that is very, naturally, obscuring. It’s like staring at the movie screen instead of being aware that you’re in the theater at the movie theater, you know? So, it’s not—yeah, it’s just the nature of staring hard at the movie screen is that you won’t be aware that you’re in the seat. Or staring hard at the meat suit or thinking that you’re the meat suit—yes. And it’s very convincing, you know. Like, I’m not making light of how incredibly rich and dense and consistent and persistent the physical simulation is. It’s very real; it’s just not the most fundamentally real thing.<br><br><br>What do you mean then by a simulation? So, that which is fundamentally real, okay, is consciousness itself or spirit itself. And that stuff which can’t actually be named, okay, but you know, the closest words we have for that is—it’s life itself, and it is of love and peace and joy and freedom and fullness. And then form—the experience of objects and thoughts and stories and bodies, meat suits—arises on and in that consciousness. The form is happening on and in the movie screen, you could say, of consciousness. And so, the reality is the movie screen, not the form. <br>The form is just something that’s been lifted up for us to experience, to deeply, apparently, lose ourselves in for a while. But it is just, you know, simulation in the sense it’s not fundamentally real. It’s just something that we’ve engaged in. It’s kind of like a dream at night. When you wake up in the morning, you don’t need someone to tell you, “Oh, that was just a dream.” You just—it’s obvious. It’s quite self-evident that, “Oh, that was just a dream. Now, this is the reality.” That’s kind of how this reality is when we awake post-life. It’s like, “Oh, of course, that was not the fundamentally real thing. That was just a really neat, deep experience I just had.” So, uh, banging the Ford pickup truck into the rocket ship last night may not have happened.<br>Well, you know, we are doing something. There’s an experience happening here. It’s just that it’s important that we keep in perspective what’s fundamentally real versus the content of the video game, so to speak. So, can you take us—all joking aside, and I just feel this levity with you, Christian—can you take us to—is it that you remembered your pre-birth experience in the early years and then it faded and then it came back? Can you take us through this arc?<br><br><br>Sure, yeah. And I did share some, and we had a wonderful conversation last time about a year ago, and I remember sharing some of this as well. So, I’ll try not to be redundant, but, um, so when I was up until the age of like five years old, I had some pre-birth memory. It was just there; it was normal. I assumed everybody knew we weren’t really from here, you know, we’re just visiting. But then that memory left me by the age of five or six, and I had no memory of that at all until the age of 30. And my body is 44 years old right now. I took up a long-term meditation practice at the age of 30, and after a few months, um, began to have out-of-body experiences and had this pre-birth memory return. And it was just so normal and natural. <br>And so, then I didn’t talk about it for like eight years because I’m a working professional. That’s the kind of thing you don’t share. But, um, I’m so glad that, you know, eventually I felt the ground was fertile enough to share it, and I did. I shared it about six years ago, and now I, you know, I’m just so passionate about sharing this—not because it’s my story; it has nothing to do with me, actually. It’s about what we are. You know, you and I were talking before we started recording about like the most important message—reminding people of who we really are, what we really are. Absolutely. Like, I feel that in my bones. Like, I am so passionate about lifting up to people: We are multi-dimensional beings of love and joy, and there is nothing to fear. Like, the end. Like, we can flesh it out really. <br>I mean, we can flesh it out in so many ways, but it is the true—it is true that we are multi-dimensional beings of love, and we have nothing to fear. And that is what I really want to lift up to people because if we really know that, we become so empowered to live this life in a way that is joyful and free and loved and loving, you know, rather than, um, fear-focused and painful.<br>Going back—thank you—going back to your pre-birth experience, what do you remember of it? What were you told or taught? And, um, were you given a plan or mission that you recall?<br>Yes, so I won’t share the whole thing for the sake of time, but I remember being inspired by a being who had incarnated to take up incarnation myself because I could see the quality of his essence and what he was like—who he had become through the process of integrating something this dense and this deep. And then, um, I had had many physical experiences—um, most of my pre-birth memories of a time immediately preceding this life, actually the one right before this one as well. <br>And I remember for that life accepting the veil, um, and the intention of that life was primarily to face and process a very deep, low-vibration fear that had bested me in a previous experience. I remember accepting the veil for that life, which I’ve described in many different, um, you know, talks, but basically, it was like a plummet in the vibration of my being that was so incredibly deep and jarring and, like, low, low, low, low, low, low—like, so low, so low. And then when you’re—I’m at the bottom, keep going lower—like, the vibrational difference between there and here is like ludicrous. <br>And then, and then after arriving—and, by the way, that plummet of vibration is not just a vibrational plummet; it’s like an erasing. It feels like, you know, of all that you are—like, an erasing of memory almost, or an obscuring, an obscuring of memory and access to knowledge. And in that lifetime, I reacted out of fear. I was like, “I’m not doing this. This is not happening. There’s no way I’m going to live a whole lifetime in this dense, dark place. No, no, no.” <br>And so, I summoned my might, and I smote the veil, caused a miscarriage for that experience because of my fighting my way back out. And I had a life review for that experience, and I saw that my fear had heaped grief upon the mother because she had lost the baby. And that by affecting the mother in that way, I had actually made hundreds of other people’s journeys more difficult. I could see like ripples in the pond.<br>So, I still had this intention to process this fear, and they brought me this life. And I reviewed this life in incredible detail. It was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side, I reviewed millions and millions of possibilities—like, going from the trunk out to the branches of all the potentiality of what this life might be. And I reviewed it all in like a second. It wasn’t hard. I had, you know, there’s incredibly wide bandwidth in spirit, and I reviewed the whole thing—like, what it would be like to be me, me. And I made certain requests for the life—I asked about certain qualities, and the guides helped me work with it. And then, eventually, I remember the moment where I accepted the veil for this life once again as a plummeting in vibration down and having all my knowing cut off. <br>And, um, this time, trying not to fight it, basically. And when I arrived at the place of being in the womb, I remember once again I was like, “I’m not doing this. Like, I’m not doing this. This is too dark. I’m not doing this.” And so, once again, I began to summon my might to fight the way out again. And when I did that, I had the most holy moment of my whole life arrive to me. It felt—this is so beyond language, and I just have to say that about all this—like, there’s no language for any of this. I get it. But I felt my being expanded back out, and The Great I Am of all things—what we call God—came to me and showed me all that I am and all that we are. <br>And I felt the bliss of our being, and I felt our son—the son of Earth—and it was like churning with bliss. It was alive; it had a consciousness to it. And I know that sounds wild, but I felt it in me. I could see it; I could feel it. And God said to me, “This is still what you are. You can never not be this.” And that is like the most holy, personal moment in my lifetime because I was like, “Oh, I haven’t lost all that I am.” You know, I stopped fighting, and I, you know, I surrendered back into being in the womb.<br>Thank you. Can you say what God said one more time because that is the everything right there? “You can never not be this. You can never not be what you are.” Like, what you truly are, you know? Like, so, basically, because I—for I had—I was reacting in fear because I thought I had lost all that I really am. That that was what this veiling meant. And I know that I’ve lived many times. I don’t really know why this veiling was so specifically hard or challenging for me, but it was. <br>And that message to me was like, “You can never lose what you really are.” And that is true of all of us. And that is what I’m so passionate about sharing—like, we cannot lose who we really are, even though we get really, really, really deeply engaged in the game here on Earth. We get deep; we’re veiled, right? And we get really lost in the story and the fear, maybe. But even, even so, you can’t lose who you really are. I mean, it’s not just about me.<br><br><br>Yeah, what if humanity, as most teachers say, that we are shifting, we are changing in dimensionality or density or whatever label we want to give it—we are evolving, ascending, changing. What if this was so hard this lifetime for you because that was important—the most important experience for you to have—for you to play your role in helping this greater ascension of consciousness?<br>Yeah, that might be, but I won’t conjecture on that. Yeah, well, I would say if everything happens for a reason, if everything is God and nothing is not, um, and if there is such a thing as divine timing, then it had to happen right here, right now for this particular lifetime, which seems to me is an accelerator toward a cliff of change, toward a singularity—whatever we want to call that—to a moment of, we are either going to or not going to. And so, we call in these experiences at this particular time, and we call ourselves here at this particular time to help with this process.<br>Sure, yeah. And one way to think about this actually is, um, I’m sensing in this moment as you described that we might make the mistake of thinking there’s us down here and then there’s that over there, and they’re two different things, and that over there is trying to like do this hard thing. <br>We’re actually all one. So, it’s actually other aspects of ourselves, really, you know, other brothers and sisters that are part of ourselves that are helping us to fulfill the incredible potential that this level of contrast offers—like, to actually integrate this, to actually shine love through it, and to actually process out all the fear. Like, that is an incredible action, you could say, that’s bigger than even one lifetime and bigger than any one person. So, yes, indeed, our spirit friends on the other side—we call it the other side in consciousness—are helping, of course. They’re part of that process.<br>Yeah, so, yeah, and then I’m with you on the other side because the other side is here. The other side is everywhere. Um, there’s—there’s a—I may not even be able to finish the thought train on this, but I’m going to bring you the thought train and see where you take it. So, you talked about a previous lifetime being in incredibly low density, uh, incredibly low vibration, shall we say. <br>And I was thinking of advanced meditators who’ve been, you know, gone through PET scans or different brain scans, and what they find is they may have both a low vibration and like a gamma—an off-the-charts vibration. And now, like, it’s becoming, I think, a hyper-gamma or something even higher than that. And it brings me to the thought of music, which is, if we judge a note, we lose the big picture. If we realize that many notes can be played simultaneously, you see where I’m going with this?<br>No, absolutely. It is like that. Um, the symphony. So, the way I put it is, contrast is useful. The depths of duality—the depths of duality are a creative offering. They’re not something to be opposed. They’re a part of the unfolding—the great unfolding, which is, you know, this—the symphony of all that is growing, the expansiveness of consciousness through the integration of experience. So, yeah, I love that. That’s beautiful.<br>Yeah, and to me, if we awaken more to it rather than judging—okay, I’m having in this moment, in this lifetime, what appears to be a lower vibration moment, but maybe this is just actually the low note that, when I combine it by awakening to who and what I am and play a higher note at the same time—or even mix and match and dare to lean into the low note—oh, yes, absolutely. <br>So, the substance that is actually fundamentally real is non-dual, and that non-dual nature is of love, peace, freedom, and joy already, okay? So, then, we don’t need to fear the depths of duality that have arisen within it because they are actually in service to it. They’re not actually opposed, you know? Now, the ego doesn’t like that, you know, because fear is about rejection; it’s about opposition. Fear says, “No, no, no, I’m a victim. Don’t you tell me otherwise.” Or, “No, no, no, this person next to me is my enemy. Don’t you tell me otherwise.” <br>That’s just what the ego does. It’s okay. But at the deepest level, there is no enemy. Like, there’s no adversary. Life is not our enemy. The physical reality is not our enemy. So, yes, we absolutely can lean into the low notes, as I love how you put that. When those low notes arise, it’s okay. Don’t judge yourself. Like, just actually say, “Oh, see that? Wow, like, this is just a profound depth of contrast that is being offered to me.” The question isn’t whether or not it’s arisen; it’s what you do with it, you see?<br><br><br>Yeah, death—since we’re talking about not fear and leaning into all that—where do we get lost on death? And is it something to fear? Death is absolutely not something to fear. There actually isn’t something called death. Um, it just looks like that in the physical, you know, because a body stops working. Death is simply the physical end of a physical journey wherein the limitations that we were wearing are dropped. So, it’s like taking off a tight shirt or an astronaut’s space suit or something, you know, and returning with fullness to who we really are. <br>You know, it is not an end. It is absolutely a beautiful, beautiful release. The harder thing is actually the other way—the coming in, incarnating. You can say birth—you can say birth is like the death because here is the state where we have adopted, temporarily, a very intense and dense and, you know, constraining set of limitations in consciousness—that is, the limitations of the body and the physics of the physical reality that we’re engaging. You know, that wearing that is hard. <br>This is like the more dead state, actually. So, physical death is—oh my gosh, it’s nothing to be feared. It is the release of those constraints, and it is a wonderful, um, a wonderful transition. It’s very normal, like, you know, we tend to kind of, I think, um, you know, make death this grand, terrifying thing in our minds. It is very normal. It’s just like waking up in the morning. It’s just what we do. It’s fine.<br><br><br>So, how are we, as multi-dimensional beings, having these pre-birth experiences? And they’re here to serve us. Are we having an—I like to use the term infinitude—are we having infinitude, meaning lifetime after lifetime of different lives? Is there an end to that? Can we choose to end that? What does that look like?<br>Yeah, so, um, I would—I feel that there is eventually an end to an incarnation cycle. Um, you know, metaphorically, you wouldn’t go to school infinitely, you know. There’s not really a reason to do that. We do get to choose. You know, we are free-willed, sovereign beings. We get to choose: Would I like to experience something else? Would I like to entertain a new perspective and integrate a new experience? <br>Would I like to deepen myself in a new way again? Now, we may do that many times because we see—we know the tangible, amazing, tasty deepening of being that is possible through physical experience integration. But it’s always our choice. Yeah, and eventually, actually, I feel there does reach a point where we say, “You know, I don’t think I’m going to continue with this school,” so to speak. <br>Like, “I don’t really need that because, ultimately, form doesn’t actually hold the answer. It’s not ultimately like the truly satisfying thing.” You know, we already have that. It’s already the oneness of being. It’s already what we truly are. So, it’s quite natural eventually to say, “No, I don’t think I’m going to go play another game.” You know, it’s just like video games. Like, you can play a bunch of video games, and eventually, they lose their luster, and you might say, “Yeah, I think I’m not going to do that anymore.”<br>It’s—when I was trying to make it to the Tour de France, I was hit by a car racing in France, and I was given a little—I don’t know—Game Boy, Nintendo, something in the hospital there where they only spoke French to me, and I didn’t speak much French. It was a very interesting experience, but I beat Tetris, and I got to watch the little space shuttle take off in this little game. <br>And then I didn’t want to play it anymore. It’s like, “All right, I won. Now what?” And now you know how to play Tetris. Yes, and you get to keep that. And you get to keep that. Yeah, that you don’t have to play. Yes, yes. And it’s a part of something that you may have very much enjoyed, and you may play again if you like. It’s kind of like that with physical incarnations.<br><br><br>Yeah, what about sensitive folk and Tetris? Because I see everybody who’s watching this show who’s drawn to your energy and drawn to my energy—we feel things at a richer, deeper, HD level that might feel, uh, on occasion or many occasions, too much.<br>Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, um, I very much understand that. I’m an extremely sensitive person. I have sensitivities that it seems that no other humans around me experience. It makes day-to-day existence very challenging at times. Okay, but the thing is—okay, there is a superpower within sensitivity because what we’ve done is—it is a brave soul, a mighty and proficient being, okay, who will dive so deeply into the physical so as to really experience it very deeply because, in that depth of experience, even more is possible—more personal growth, more healing, and more service, actually, to the collective as well—the whole. <br>So, it’s actually an amazing power to be very sensitive here. There are different levels of engagement in the physical, you know. It’s not like every human is having the same experience. Some are having a much less, um, deep and sensitive experience. It might be more kind of rote or, you know, non-super alert, you know—sometimes ignorance is bliss kind of thing where it’s less challenging if there’s, you know, if it’s kind of automatic. Whereas there is something of a great challenge in very deeply engaging the physical and then seeing how we can do even that. <br>But there’s so much power in it. So, I’m glad you asked that question because I feel like, you know, a lot of people who may resonate with your message and certainly people who’ve reached out to me are very sensitive people—you know, very empathic, spiritually aware people. And, you know, I understand it’s the sensitive folks who kind of feel the most trampled at times, but man, it’s also such a power. <br>And if we can use that sensitivity to actually feel on the spirit and to really process the physical that deeply and to really let go of the physical that deeply, wow, the amount of, um, energy—spiritual energy—and potency that can rise up and be there with us and through us is amazing. So, yeah, it’s actually a superpower.<br><br><br>Thank you. Would you mind sharing about—and then I want to go into if we can—how we can, um, see our own pre-birth experiences. What are some of the sensitivities that you’ve been challenged with, and how have you worked with that?<br>Yeah, wow, that’s a big question. I’ll keep it simple because it’s—I could go on for an hour about that, but I’m sensitive to all substances—foods, all drugs, all smells. I’m sensitive to light. I can’t use any computer monitors that have been made in the last 10 years because they flicker very quickly at the pixel level—temporal dithering is what it’s called. It took me years to figure out what the problem was. The headlights on my car—I can’t drive my car at night because if they flicker at 180 hertz—I measured it—and it just causes me pain like instantly. Um, I’m sensitive to people’s energies. I’m sensitive to, um, qualities of energy that may not even be related to people. So, it’s a very rich—I mean, so, like, places or, um, intentionality behind things—like, a book. The author has a certain energy, and that energy carries into the book. <br>Things like that that you wouldn’t even—that you wouldn’t even—I pick up a book, I don’t need—yesterday, we were gifted a book, and I said, “Here, let me feel that for a minute.” Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, so I feel like that. Like, and there’s certain authors where I feel the energy of their words, and I’m like, “Oh my goodness, that’s beautiful.” Like, Seth from Seth Speaks—I love the energy of Seth. Very different energy, but I love the energy of Silver Birch, channeled by Maurice Barbanell in the 1930s in the UK. That’s a channeled book—not many people know about it—amazing work. <br>The energy there is—oh, it’s amazing. So, anyway, so I tend to feel that everywhere. And if I eat one thing that my body doesn’t resonate with, like, it can affect me for days, you know? Um, I’ve also experienced many health challenges throughout my life—chronic health challenges. I won’t go into many of them, but, like, you know, just as some quick examples, I’ve experienced biochemical ups and downs—you know, people can call that like a form of bipolar or something—but I’ve had depression moments that are so painful, you know? <br>I understand it has to do with the processing of all these deep experiences I’ve had and the sensitivity I’ve experienced. Um, chronic fatigue, I’ve experienced. Epstein-Barr, migraine headaches. I had a spontaneous lung collapse when I was 26, and I was in a hospital for 10 days. I have connective tissue issues. Like, I’ve experienced many things that, like, are just not typical, you know, typical sensitivities in the body. Anyway, so I won’t go on at length about it, but it’s fascinating because I’m on my own journey right now, particularly with an often swollen belly right now where I keep pulling things out of the diet. <br>And then, on occasion, I’ll notice, um, an errant, in-quote thought will occur, and all of a sudden, the belly is swollen, and I’m going, “I didn’t even eat air right now.” It’s a sensitivity, like you’re saying, on levels to energy. So, what have you done? What is your process besides stripping away? How have you been able to work with this?<br>Well, there are two things that come to mind that I want to lift up, and the first one you may not think is directly related, but truly it is. So, the body—there was a long time when I resisted the body. I resisted the pains, the chronic illness, all the difficulty. But I found that the body is actually an amazingly faithful soundboard for experience integration itself. You know, we’re here to have a physical, bodily experience. <br>So, the body and its responses to things is like a beautiful invitation to listen to it, to work with it, and to actually follow intuition for what the body is actually asking for because it may not be what the mainstream says, okay? So, then, the other thing I would lift up is actually meditation because, as we become more familiar with what we really are—awareness itself, consciousness itself—versus the form, the thought, the sensations, you know, we develop this precious ledge to stand on—this like space of power and peace that life, with a capital L, rises up through in consciousness into the body, actually, and it strengthens us. <br>What it reminds me of is actually—I don’t know if you’ve heard of breatharianism—you know, there are actually some individuals who physically don’t eat. You know, they did a documentary on this, and they—one guy, they tested him in the hospital for an extended duration. He doesn’t eat or drink. These, you know, some—it’s not common, but there are some people who apparently do not eat or drink. I know that sounds wild, but they sustain themselves through that direct energetic connection because that is—yeah, prana—because that is the true source of strength. <br>So, I’m lifting that up because what sensitive people, especially if we can get in touch with that, we tend to really become vibrant from it and with it. You know, it’s almost like we’re built to receive it and to experience that in consciousness rather than trying to find the next physical thing to scratch the itch, you know—the next drink or the next whatever. Like, no, this is about like a purity of energy that can actually empower the body.<br>Yeah, thank you. Let’s go from there. Can we consciously become aware of our pre-birth experiences? And if so, how do we do that?<br><br><br>Yeah, well, it is always technically possible, and I can’t speak for any individual person, but I’ll at least say that meditation is really helpful because, as we grow in familiarity with what we really are, the larger parts of ourselves tend to just be there. They tend to rise up on their own, and that may include pre-birth awareness. <br>Now, it’s okay if it doesn’t. In fact, when we go into the long-term meditation practice, it’s—I find it’s best to arrive with no expectations, zero goals, other than alert awareness and other than objective investigation of, “What am I? What is consciousness beneath thought?” And that doesn’t have a goal; it doesn’t have an outcome to it. But as we do that and as we—it’s kind of backwards—as we let go of everything and even expectation, it tends to be that, yes, the larger parts of ourselves will rise up on their own. So, it is possible to see that. <br>Now, for some, it won’t be beneficial necessarily to know at the human level what’s been planned, but on the other hand, there’s not like a true rule or something. It’s just that—see, we adopted the veil and the limitations, but we’re allowed to do whatever we would like through it and with it. We are completely free, creative, powerful beings. So, we’re allowed to do what we like with it and see, “Whoa, what can I do from within the veiled experience?”<br><br><br>Yeah, so that brings up the question of soul contracts and karma and things of this sort. Where does that fit in?<br>Well, there are two different questions I feel. Soul contracts just mean, you know, what is the deep soul-level agreement that you signed up for pre-life? And in my case, it was to process this very specific fear, and my life was kind of built around this theme. But of course, it’s not just one thing. There’s also many things that can occur in a life—a lot of potential, a lot of experience integration that’s possible. <br>When it comes to karma, now, karma is just another word for cause and effect, but not just physical cause and effect—energetic cause and effect. Another way to put that is basically, you are who you are. So, who you are, you carry with you from one life to the next. You’re not different people. I mean, you may experience the perspective of being different people, but it’s still you. It’s still you. <br>So, if you are a person who has fear and has ego and has historically responded—perhaps, let’s say, you have a fear of powerlessness, so you respond in anger because anger seems to give you this power. It’s just like this fake thing. Maybe that’s been a pattern. Well, then, that’s just who you are. You just are the being that has had that pattern and experiences that level of fear. So, it’s not that karma is a punishment; it’s more like we are naturally guided into who we really are so that we can process out that which is yet unhealed.<br>Can you repeat that one more time for us?<br><br><br>Yeah, so, we tend to be guided into situations, experiences, contexts that help us to see who we really are so that, if there’s something that’s unhealed, we have the opportunity to heal it. So, for example, you know, people might ask about, like, lower-vibration astral realms where there’s some lot of negative, gunky stuff happening. <br>Well, if you’re someone who resonates into that gunk for some reason, it may be useful for you to experience that gunk because you’re choosing it, actually. You may not be aware of it, but if you choose the gunk, then you’re going to see the gunk until you actually experientially learn—not just intellectually learn—but experientially learn, “Oh, that’s not optimal,” and you process out whatever fear gave rise to that pattern. It gives you the opportunity to process the fear, ultimately.<br>So, then, if we go big picture—still Earth, but big picture—are we all as one collective, one collective consciousness, choosing to see the gunk? And is it to see the gunk to heal the gunk, to bring it up? Why are we in a gunk-aided world, apparently gunk-aided world, right now?<br>Yeah, we’re in a gunk-aided world because the limitations are extreme, and we have not yet fully evolved enough to integrate the fear that has arisen in response to those limitations. And I’m just using the word fear, but fear in this comment means all of the ego shenanigans that arise out of fear—selfishness, hatred, anger, you know, all this us-versus-them thinking, all these beliefs—actually, belief itself is often a tool of the ego, you know. All these patterns that the human race has kind of enshrined for thousands of years as a response to fear. <br>As we evolve, we tend to face that root crap directly and process it and integrate it. But it can’t be faced unless it’s seen. So, often, we manifest it, whether consciously or unconsciously, so that we can see the insanity of fear and process our way past it and heal. And we do that, uh, well, we do it collectively, but it’s done at the individual level. So, it’s really important to not feel powerless in this. In fact, if even one person really, truly processes their crap—you know, owns their crap, faces their fear, and really chooses more often authenticity and love and peace and joy in their lives in a small way, it does have a huge vibrational impact for the entire collective consciousness. So, we are actually each very much empowered to help the awakening of the whole.<br>Love it. What is one way that we can face and turn—since we’re going there today—turn and face our crap?<br><br><br>Yeah, so, um, be willing to see what’s actually there. That sounds simple, but it’s not. The ego loves covering things up—hundreds of layers. Be willing to actually see what’s there. And then, when you see it, that is when you feel the negative feeling in your body, or you see the pattern in your past, or you see how you were abused and how that wounded you—whatever that negative gunk is—then face it and feel it and accept it. Accepting it doesn’t mean, “Oh, I really hate you, but I’m going to push you away.” No, it means, “Wow, I feel wounded.” Acknowledging it 100%, feeling 100%. Let—if you want to, if you need to cry, let yourself cry. If you need to go take a nap, go do it. I’m just saying, be so allowing that you actually accept and feel what is actually in there. And that’s like a way of saying yes to life. So, saying yes to life means even saying yes to the darkness that you may have historically been churning so that you can process past it.<br>Yeah, cool. Thank you. So, all right, we’ve—I’m going to say all of us, but most of us—have had the experience where we’ve met somebody, maybe we’ve fallen in love with somebody, looked into their eyes, and, like, and then it is such an instant connection, and it didn’t work out, and we’re going, “Well, wait a second, if I have such a recognition of this person, why didn’t it work out?” Are these people that we knew before? Are they part of our soul family? What is the recognition that’s going on here?<br><br><br>Yeah, so, the recognition is—this recognition can actually happen, um, anywhere with any being. It doesn’t have to be an attractive person or someone that’s just your soulmate because we are all a part of the one ocean. So, that unity of being is beautiful. It is like we are individuated, but we are simultaneously one with the whole and with each other. And so, when we see another, it is a recognition of the other as being a part of yourself. And that connectedness is kind of—it’s actually what we all yearn for on Earth because Earth is one of the things that makes Earth so crazy unique is the incredible degree of separation. Like, we feel separate here. <br>It’s crazy how separate we feel. So, if we even get a glimmer of connectedness, we tend to like, “Oh, wow, we want to grab right on to that.” You know, now, it might fail, you know, because we get really deeply form-associated, which means both our own fear-based responses—ego—and how we treat our relationships, but also because we tend to associate then into form only—you know, maybe a body or an activity or a, you know, something. But the thing is, connectedness is about a quality of intention, not a form. It’s about love first. It’s about vulnerability, openness, you know. When we’re in that state of vulnerability, openness, and realness, then that connection rises up because we’ve stopped putting up a boundary, you see? So, I don’t know if that speaks to your question.<br>It speaks a little bit. I am curious, though, on an individual level, are there souls—are there sparks from the other side, souls that we see, meet, or know on the other side that then we recognize here on Earth?<br>Absolutely, yeah. We do know each other in much broader form on the other side. So, we have many relationships; we just don’t remember on Earth. It’s quite normal, and we have a lot of love. Love is the name of the game. So, yeah, absolutely, we could have relationships with those who we have known before that we already have relationship with here on Earth and recognize them, absolutely.<br>Yeah, have you spent much time consciously on the other side? And what is life like there? Because if there is no—if life continues, which it does, but if life continues, um, what does life after life look like?<br><br><br>Yes, so, that’s like asking if we’re in the game of Minecraft on the video game on the computer. It’s like, you in Minecraft, you just ask me, “So, what is Earth like? Tell me about the blocks.” You know, well, Earth is so much bigger than little eight-bit blocks in a Minecraft game. There’s so many activities. A Minecraft character couldn’t even imagine. So, it’s kind of like that when we start talking about the other side. We’re talking about a hugely, hugely deep, rich, vast, complex multiverse, you know? So, there are so many opportunities and different types of experience—even just thought-responsive realities where we might take with us certain form associations that we either are just kind of lost within or that we just enjoy. <br>We might create, manifest, so there are Earth-looking reality systems just because that’s what we like—trees, so there’s trees, you know, that beautiful Florida background, which is live, by the way, for anybody who’s wondering. When we first started recording, I thought maybe it was my editor told me today, “Shut off the background noise suppression so people can hear it.” But, but, but I gotta be honest, Christian, there are people blasting music—I can only hear it a little bit—but blasting music on the other side of the waterway here, and if YouTube actually picks up what that sound is, it’ll pan it, saying, “You’re playing music without permission.” <br>And so, the boats—the boats go by silently at the moment. They actually have a noise. The birds and squirrels have a noise, too. Anyway, so, yeah, so I don’t know if I answered your question about the other side, but it’s really, really difficult to describe from here where we have a super crude, limited set of metaphors. I can simply say it’s a multiverse of possible experience which is so rich and real and varied that it’s quite difficult to describe. Now, I’m still veiled very much, you know. <br>Out-of-body experiences happen, but it’s, you know, it’s not like every day or something for me, though it is relatively common, but, um, at least in small measure, you know. But I feel like I’m here to be human right now. Like, at first, when I started having out-of-body experiences, it was like, “Well, that’s all I wanted to go do now because it’s so beautiful and rich and fun.” Like, the fun is off the charts. So, but I’m here to be the human character right now. I, you know, that’s what I’m here to do. So, I’ve actually felt called to be more physically focused over the last like three or four years, you know, to really experience the human condition, not so much, you know, higher reality states.<br><br><br>See, that makes total sense to me because I don’t want to pick—I never will pick on or judge anybody, but there is this, um, not an avatar archetype, which is, “I’m spiritual and not grounded.” And I believe we came here—like, I still like rocking it on my bike or swimming or running or any of these things, embodying the physical because we came here to experience that—not just that, to remember who we are, but as a creator in a place where we can actually move the blocks around. <br>And so, absolutely, 100%, we are here to experience the physical, not to reject it and escape because it’s kind of, you know, “Oh, it’s dense, and oh, it’s painful. I really just want to avoid it.” No, like, this is spiritual—not just talking about spirituality—like making dinner, you know, like playing a game. Like, I love games, and there’s like a tabletop game. I paint these little models, and I go to the store and play with other people who’ve painted their models. I love that. <br>Like, it’s just as simple. It’s physical. We roll dice, you know. It’s—I feel spiritual in that because it’s something that I enjoy actually pursuing. What we enjoy is a part of what we’re here to do, actually—just to enjoy the playground of the physical in whatever way it calls to us. That is an alignment with our true nature because our true nature is joy and passion and fun and freedom. So, yeah, doing what is available in the physical with that spirit is powerful. It’s really good to do.<br><br><br>What’s interesting to me is, so, I’ll go after this, and, you know, I’ll spend a little time with the family, and then I’m going to go out for a run on the trails. And I’m going to go out for a run on the trails, and I’m going to be in this bliss state, this joy state, and all of a sudden, ideas from higher consciousness are going to come to me—ideas as if I was meditating while I’m actually even more playing in the physical. <br>There is no—this is all one. It’s all one, absolutely. And the more you deeply investigate your true self, the more what you just described happens because it is one. Because you’ve begun to awaken, actually, to see form for what it is. You can deeply engage form even as larger parts of yourself rise up and touch or whisper or whatever. It’s even bilocation—sounds crazy to some people, but it’s actually possible to experience being exactly where you are, seeing out your eyes, doing something, and also to be somewhere else at the same time. You know, that kind of experience can just naturally happen when we’re less form-associated.<br>Have you done that yourself?<br>Um, not recently. I have experienced that briefly.<br>Yeah, okay. Yeah, I’ve had students say that I visited them, and I’m like, “Not on a conscious level.” So, on the—yeah, so I was talking about conscious at the human level bilocation, but at the soul level, we are multilocational all the time. I don’t know if that’s a word, but like, we do interact with each other’s higher selves. <br>I’ve actually done that, um, a number of times where I’ve interacted with the higher portion of a person and then try to confirm it with them physically, and it’s really interesting. Um, that yes, we really are connected. We really can interact with the higher self of someone, and, and I find a very easy way that we can do this is if you find yourself finishing somebody else’s sentence, if you find yourself saying something the other person was going, “I was just thinking that myself,” I feel like you’re having a conversation up here—for use of up and down—and that’s coming out here, but it’s confirmation that, uh, there’s this other conversation already going on.<br><br><br>Yeah, so, we’re already telepathically connected with everybody else because they are us. You know, we are all one. That doesn’t mean you’re not you. You are you; you’re precious, individuated, but you’re also one with the whole. And so, like, in higher systems, communication is all telepathic. It’s complete, full, transparent, you know, not up for misinterpretation. It’s very, very full and complete. <br>That connectedness remains between us all the time. And like, I recently had a one-on-one with somebody where I was, you know, really feeling into them and feeling this great challenge they’re going through in their life, and I was sharing what I was feeling, and I remember she said something like, “Well, what are you doing?” And all I could say in that state of consciousness was, “Well, you are a part of me. I’m just looking at that part of me.” So, that’s how it is with all of us. We are parts of each other. So, even if we don’t know it at the human level, we’re already communicating with those around us—like, your partner, your spouse, your girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever. You and that person are probably already having quite a bit of dialogue that you may not be aware of.<br>So, here’s what you don’t want to do—and not that we don’t want to do anything—but I remember after my first near-death experience, and I could feel this oneness, this connection to all, and, you know, it starts to fade, but it’s there. And, um, I would have an interesting experience with somebody—maybe there’s somebody who had more, quote-unquote, power over me or something, whatever that means—and I would start looking at them really funny and like trying to see—you don’t do this—but really, what I was trying to do is feel them without knowing that I can actually just stop and be still, and I’m feeling them. And once I learned that—that you can actually plug into somebody else’s energy just in the moment, just by being present—oh, changes everything.<br>Oh, it does, and it’s beautiful. And you know what that reminds me of actually is, um, the last few years, I’ve attended—the last two years in person—I’ve attended the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS) National Conference. Um, this past year, it was in Phoenix; last year, it was in Washington, D.C. <br>There’s about 700 people present, and the majority of them have all had some type of experience—whether near-death experience or out-of-body experiences, whatever—pre-birth experiences in my case. And they—everybody—there’s this arrival of connectedness that doesn’t need to be said. It’s just there. And the energy—it’s so beautiful. And for five days or something—four or five days—at least how I experience it is just genuine connectedness and love. <br>And that is the natural way, and actually, that’s the direction humanity is headed, by the way, circling back to the awakening. Like, we are headed in that direction where we actually feel that connectedness more consciously every day.<br>Well, there’s a book I’m starting right now—um, I wrote it this past year. It didn’t work out; we’re restarting it. Um, and it will work out—meaning, I got through to the ending, and the way it was edited didn’t work. There’s—the energy has shifted and changed so much just in the last year alone, which is—which is a book on, “All right, you just had your WTF experience. <br>Now what? How do we integrate this? How we’re learning—we’re all having these awakening experiences. We don’t have a clue what to do with it. We try to shut it down; that doesn’t work well. Who and what am I? Where do I go from here with this?”<br>Well, that’s a very personal question because the way that we each engage with the world of form is unique because each soul is unique. Each physical journey is unique. Each of us have hang-ups that might be unique, you know? My challenge might be no challenge at all for you or for somebody else. You know, we all have our own specific way of processing form and qualities of being. <br>So, when we then have a WTF moment—well, there’s different ways I can interpret that, but a crisis or an awakening, you know, and that which can be a crisis, you know—then, how do you handle that? Well, it really has to do with what is your evolving relationship with form—with the world, with your body, with the thoughts in your mind, with your conditioning, with your story. And then, it’s a move towards alertness and a move towards freedom and vulnerability, but that takes courage. It takes willingness to feel. It takes a real processing of experience, yeah, that can be no joke.<br>Oh, my. I share it all the time, and we’ll pull out the bleep key, but integration is a—to go from this multi-dimensional—it’s like, it’s why you hit the reset button when you were coming in here, and why myself—I’m convinced the doctors had to pull me out with tongs from mom—forgive me, everybody—and I had a temporary cone head because I’m saying, “Take me back. This is too tight of a suit. It doesn’t fit me. It’s very, very limiting.” Now, it’s not actually charged, but it is extremely limiting. And what I mean by that is, we actually apply the meaning.<br>So, I’m lifting that up because one of the things we’re here to do is, okay, now that you’re in a super tight suit, now that you’re super limited, and you cannot jump more than two feet in the air, and you have to go through linear time, and your body gets old and sick, you know, maybe, and you have this context and all these limitations of Earth—now, what do you do? You know, what quality of intention do you wield, and what meaning do you apply? Those are the two main angles—like, how, what types of choices do you make? <br>Can you make a choice that’s loving, fearless, of freedom, of peace, even when the constraints are tight? You know, that’s the real question. And can you recognize that, “Oh, this limiting set—it may be even painful, but it’s neutral. So, what meaning do you put on it? How do you meet that present moment with meaning or with belief?” Like, take belief—what is your relationship to belief? That alone is such a huge topic. There’s so many people that are wielding belief, utilizing belief in a way that’s very egoic, you know. So, like, what is your relationship even to previous belief systems? <br>You know, that takes a lot of courage to look back and go, “Wow, I, boy, I think I had it wrong.” I went through that. At my during my awakening, man, I took so much humility and courage to say, “You know what? This belief system that I put all this energy into for 30 years, it’s not what I thought. It’s bigger than this.”<br>Are you still—I’ll speak for myself personally, and I want to say this in a very non-judgmental way, but I keep realizing even as a, quote-unquote, teacher—these are all dis-labels—that everything I thought was wrong, and then everything I thought was wrong, but wrong isn’t even the right word. It’s just an expansion—too small.<br>Yes, thank you. Yeah, just too small. That’s all. It’s not wrong; it’s just too small. Yes, yeah. And I imagine you’re going through the same thing. So, look back, and certainly, what you thought 30 years ago isn’t what you think today, but even what you thought last year isn’t what you think today, and what you think today—because everything’s moving so much faster—it’s probably not what you’re going to think tomorrow.<br>Yes, that’s true. And the movement though is in this direction. I’ll just put it this way—in the direction of that which does not change. It’s in the direction of the beingness that has no limitation and is total love and peace and freedom and joy forever, amen—like, total bliss. So, that is the—it’s like an unshackling towards that. You know, it’s like an expansion out of small boxes, maybe even to bigger boxes, eventually towards complete freedom.<br><br><br>Yeah, now, speaking of boxes, um, I just picked up on this tiny little sleight-of-hand comment from earlier, so please forgive me. You said, “Old and sick, maybe.”<br>Yeah, I said maybe because sickness is not even guaranteed. We will get older, yeah. I’m just lifting up that it’s not necessarily true that sickness is part of the game. Now, it is often—it’s very common in the physical to experience sickness. I’m just qualifying that because consciousness is first; the physical is second. So, there’s never actually like a pre-ordained, you know, physical outcome. We—it’s important that we retain the primacy of power where it is, which is in spirit itself, consciousness itself. Now, practically speaking, of course, illness arises. It’s quite common, you know, in this condition. And then, we just—then, we that’s a new constraint. Then, we just choose, “Okay, how do I meet this?” You know, that’s all we have to do.<br>Thank you. So, let’s talk about duality. Let’s play with this for a brief moment here. So, um, I can say that this is not real; this is a simulation, and I can go buy the greatest gas guzzler in the world, rip out the catalytic converter, whatever, and just have it belching fumes everywhere, going down the road, saying, “None of this mattered.” I didn’t say it doesn’t matter.<br>Yeah, yeah, well, that’s where I’m getting at. How do we balance that because if I could ask the question, “Does Earth need to be saved?” and you would say, “Well, there is no needing to save the Earth,” on the other hand, it all matters energetically. Help me understand.<br>Sure, so, the shared dream that we’re all experiencing is a real experience. It’s not fundamentally real form, but you’re having an experience; I’m having an experience; and 7.9 or so billion other players that are humans are having an experience, and all the beings who are experiencing being animals are having an experience. There’s a lot of experience of consciousness, which is real, having an experience. <br>And love, okay, is a call to actualize—to actualize the best for every other being, every other part of yourself, and the entirety of the whole. Love is a call of service to them. It’s about putting them first, actually. It’s about serving them. Service is our calling, and service means actualizing. Okay, so, that means though, even though it’s a dream, how can I make this a better dream for myself and for others? Love is about responsibility. Quality of intention is action. It means action. <br>Intention is the primary movement; it’s the primary important thing. But if you intend to lift your arm, you will lift your arm, assuming you have the physical ability to lift your arm, you know? Intention means action. So, a loving intention means we will see where the world needs us or what behaviors we might change or how we might help the person next to us. Like, like this conversation, you know? <br>Like, here we are just having a conversation, but what we’re doing is we’re choosing to share and to talk, to share not only information, not only talking, but the love, the energy. I feel your energy; I feel your love. It’s beautiful. And others, hopefully, when—if others hear this, they will feel their own love and the love that is all of us. And that helps that energetically to appear locally into the local system. And then, not only that, but then we physically take action in the local system. You know, those two things are related.<br><br><br>Yeah, I’m watching this boat go by, and I’m thinking of throwing a stone into the water because that’s what our conversation is, but it’s actually—man, if I take one quote away from today, it’s, “Your quality of intention is your action.” If we understand that, we put out with energy first. If you put out the energy of love, that is an action, and that has, as behind me, massive ripple effect.<br>Yeah, and I guess I meant that in two ways though because the way I originally meant was, um, it means that you will take physical action, but absolutely what you just said is true—that the quality of intention automatically has an energetic effect. The physical only actualizes and manifests well in accordance with the rule set, which is quite limited and dense, but it is a probabilistic simulation. It’s not objective. So, what that means is consciousness is always pushing on how the unfolding is happening, and that is energetic. And in other words, your intention itself affects physical outcome. It does.<br>Well, and now, if I’m thinking love—if I’m—and so, I’ve got my little prayer stone here, and I’m constantly going, “I send love, I send love, I send love.” If I am doing that from an energetic point of view enough, and somebody cuts me off, or somebody is having a rough day, or somebody or something—anything—I am more likely to take—and here’s that action—an action out of love because that is the energy that I’ve been bathing in or the quality of my intention.<br>Yes, definitely. In both planes—both in the non-physical energetic plane, you are already doing something, but then in the physical plane, which is just another layer of the same energy—ultimately, it’s ultimately consciousness—but in the physical dense plane, yes, we will then take a loving action that maybe we otherwise wouldn’t have. And, by the way, like, if we notice ourselves—part of awakening and taking responsibility for our crap means taking responsibility for what we see ourselves doing. <br>So, if you notice, “Oh, I was a little bit rude to that person,” or even, “I feel irritated,” like, you know, sometimes I feel irritated, but if I feel irritated, I might say, “Okay, why? Where is the perception at the root because there’s a fear down there. There’s an egoic response. Irritation is an egoic response; it’s not the peace of being.” So, we become more alert so that we can actually then read our own behavior and the world around us and the responses of others as a way of valuable feedback, actually, to learn, like, “Oh, how can I actually choose love or do—where do I have an unhealed part of myself yet?” Yeah, it’s a useful feedback loop.<br><br><br>Thank you. So, last night—I’m in this beautiful neighborhood here where, um, there is apparently—and I don’t want to give it too much fuel—a real, in quotes, possibility of them knocking down a whole bunch of trees to straighten the roads, cut out the forest, and pave through paradise. And so, I go to a city hall meeting last night, and I had the same sickly feeling—forgive me, everybody—that I’ve had when tromping the hallowed halls of Congress. <br>And I was gifted to go through the hallowed halls in Congress and literally go on a train—I rode a train, didn’t speak with her—with Hillary Clinton in this little tram with me many, many years ago. And there was a very interesting energy there and a very interesting energy of power. And I know that you’ve experienced this on the other side of the veil, and I feel as our energy is changing, our understanding of authority gets to change, and people—both authority saving, but what this future system looks like. So, really throwing a lot on you there. Take it from here, Christian.<br>Oh, no, absolutely. And I understand what you’re lifting up because, in the higher systems, authority is love and wisdom. They’re synonymous. So, like, in my pre—when I was a young child, actually, that was one of the assumptions I just assumed would be true on Earth—that the higher of in a position of authority somebody was, the more loving and wise they would be naturally. <br>So, a teacher must be loving and wise, and the mayor of a city must be really loving and wise, and the president of the United States must be the most loving and wise person. That is just what I assumed to be true here. Now, that’s not currently the case on Earth—without judgment, we get it—without right, it’s not currently the case because the—we’ll just call it the average vibration or the mean vibration on Earth is quite low by comparison to those realms. So, our institutionalized systems—the systems that have succeeded and endured—even our businesses, they’re really based in a lot of old thinking—us-versus-them thinking, controlling power-type thinking. <br>When I was in Washington, D.C., for the IANDS conference, the Pentagon was across the street—like, literally, like, out the window was the Pentagon. So, here we were, you know, 700 or so people just sharing so much authentic love, and across the street was the Pentagon. I could feel that interesting difference. It’s not a judgment; it’s just that there’s a normalcy that’s been kind of enshrined there of a certain pattern of thinking, a certain energy. That’s all. And so, but the true power is love. That is true even if all 100 people around you don’t understand. <br>You know, like, when what comes to mind is Jesus, actually. You know, when Jesus was hanged on a cross, it was about the act of love. It’s about love. It’s not about whether or not those people understood because love is quite independent and free from scope. It’s quality; it’s a quality, you see. And so, as we really truly align with that quality, it has—because it is the true ultimate spiritual power that precedes the physical—even if it takes a very long time because the physical is slow at manifesting, okay? Even if it takes a long time, the power of that love erodes fear. It’s like wind or rain on dirt or shale. Like, if you arrive in authenticity in love, gently, repeatedly, it tends—even if the other person doesn’t recognize it at first consciously—they will at the soul level, you see. <br>And not only at the individual level, but even the energy of the space, the energy of the work, it can’t help but sense that and be eroded by it. And so, I’ve seen that where it’s like, if you just arrive with love, you don’t actually have to expect an outcome. If you simply arrive with that quality of intention, you’re actually already free, you know, because love is freedom. It’s already free. <br>So, if you arrive with that, it almost—I don’t want to say it doesn’t matter what happens, but that’s the freedom of how you arrive is that it doesn’t actually matter. We just arrive how we arrive with love, and then, the other individuals—the other parts of ourselves that are also growing and learning—they will make their choices, you see. And it’s okay if they make certain choices. <br>We are free-willed beings; we’re here to make choices. They might not make a loving choice immediately, but at least if you provide the candle, you know, at least if you provide the strength—because love is like a form of strength; it’s like power—at least if you arrive and provide that tiny little package of power, it might encourage them—whether right now or in one day or in 10 years or in the next lifetime, actually—to choose love as well and to face their own crap and to participate in evolution. Oh, it’s beautiful. Like, we are empowered to do that.<br>And to me, it’s very real. If you see somebody—like, if I saw people at the meeting last night, and I was—I went to a gas—which I didn’t, but you had to remind yourself to stay in a state of love. Um, but if I surrendered—for lack of another word—that, “Here’s what I’d like,” but I let go even of that, I believe it’s actually more likely to happen because they can feel the energy of resistance.<br>Yes, you’re right. Yes, yeah. And that’s one of the beautiful things—like, if when we truly arrive with love, we don’t require the other person to change. And that’s beautiful.<br>Yeah, so, before we wind things down, and I want to send everybody to your work, what—based on this conversation—what is pulling on your heart to share with people that I may not have covered yet?<br><br><br>Yeah, what’s been pulling on my heart lately is there’s a lot of small stuff that’s really loud lately. It’s up to you to actually make the specific choice to take time away from the loud small things and to focus deeply within and on the peace—even for 40 minutes, the meditation—to take time for meditation or to take time outside for 12 minutes and to appreciate that beautiful flowing water behind you. I’m just lifting that up because we often think, “Oh, I can’t go do that because look at all these really important things.” <br>Our thoughts even seem really important, you know? All the daily things that we got to do—really important, really important. Boss, you got to pay attention to this; you better pay attention to this. This is just a gentle reminder. It’s okay. You are actually empowered to stop, to sit down, or to stand, or whatever you prefer, and to be present and to be alert. That choice is powerful. It opens a space. So, lately, I felt like there’s so much loud little stuff kind of drawing people’s attentions, and it’s okay to, as the individual—don’t worry about the whole collective—just for you, take that time away. Look inward; look to yourself. Connect with spirit; connect with nature—whatever that calling is—and do that consistently, you know. And that really, that really helps practically speaking.<br>Woohoo! Thank you, thank you!<br>You're welcome. So, Christian, where can people go to find out more, to find your book, to find your beautiful work?<br>Sure, thank you. My website is AWalkInThePhysical.com, and the book is available online for free at the third link down on the book page on that website. So it's not about money, it's just there—you just, anybody can click on it. It's an online PDF. It is available on Amazon in print or Kindle, or on Audible. Those are not free, but it's available in all those forms.<br>The book is a reality model. I'm trying to speak to what our higher nature is and what the human experience is—what we're doing here, and how we can best sense who we really are. How can we process our fear and live in love while we're here? You know, that's really what it's about. My website also has a number of talks that I've participated in.<br>I'm also happy to try to respond to emails, but I often cannot get to them—I get a lot of emails. But it's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:AWalkInThePhysical@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://awakening2024.neocities.org/mailto:AWalkInThePhysical@gmail.com" target="_blank">AWalkInThePhysical@gmail.com</a>.<br>Thank you! What's your mission right now?<br>Oh, oh, my mission is to choose love. And that means, for me, that I am so impassioned about reminding people of who we really are and that we don't need to be afraid. I'm not fooled by the density of the dream. Love is—like, the freedom of our true nature is the best news. It's so empowering. I am just so, like, kind of fearless now about hopefully reaching out to everybody that I can to remind them: you are a powerful, multidimensional being of love. It's not just a weird spiritual woo-woo thing—it's just like physics. It's just what you are. And so I'm so passionate about that because if even one person feels more empowered while we're here in the physical, that is the coolest. It's just amazing work.<br>Also, we're living at a really interesting time right now. Like, everybody who's listening today just felt this nudge come through—just be aware. We are living in a super interesting, very unique, very "coolest corner in the universe"-type moment, actually, on Earth during The Awakening. It is an honor to be here right now. So don't feel disempowered—you are important. You are part of the awakening process. And if you just choose love and peace and joy and freedom in your own way, in your own life, in whatever small way, and be your authentic self, you are helping that momentum grow. And that is a powerful service. So, yeah, that's the most important thing I think I can live.<br>Woohoo! So, I just had a weird—I'll share this, then we'll wind this down. I'm both very present with you, staying plugged in at the same time, and I'm usually going, "I send love, I send love, I send love." And then I started to go, "Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you, God." And what "Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you, God." means is—I'm recognizing the Divine speaking through you right now. I'm recognizing that you are all of that. And I couldn't help but go there without conscious thought. It was really cool.<br>Christian: We all are. It's definitely not me—there's not a separate person that gets credit or something. It's just what we are. And that's the beautiful thing—when any of us can be that with each other, then everyone can be free. And that is awesome. Like, love—like, service—is its own reward. Love is its own beautiful reward. Something like that.<br>Any last words of wisdom you want to share with people? You may have just done that.<br>Yeah. Just one last thing—thank you for being human today. Not many people probably say that, but it really is a service to be here at this time. I know it's not easy at times. So, thank you for being here, and know that there's nothing to fear. And that's it.<br>Woohoo! Thank you so much, Christian. So, for everyone out there, this is Michael Sandler saying—be well, have fun, enjoy the meat suit, be human with all that you've got, and send love, send love, send love. And above and beyond all else—shine bright!<br>Woohoo! How does it get any better than this? Thank you so much, Christian. You know, I say "Wow, wow, wow" after all shows, but wow, wow, wow—superlatives don’t go far enough. This was a really deep one. This was a "fasten your seatbelt"—Christian is real. Christian has it going on. He has a great understanding of who and what you are, who and what I am, who and what all of us are. And so this was, to me, a very magical interview with a very special soul.<br>On that note—if you want to dive even deeper, if you want to learn who you are at the highest level and bring your energy up, up, up, and way up, click that link below and join the School of Mystics.

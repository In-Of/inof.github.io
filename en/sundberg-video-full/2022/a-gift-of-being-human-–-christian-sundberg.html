Oh my God! What do I do about this? Hello. There you go. Hello. Hello, how are you?<br>
I'm good, thank you. How are you?<br>
Fantastic. Living the human dream.<br>
We are all very brave. We are all very brave for being here. I really hope that people who hear this can be reminded of who they, who we really are. You know, if we can do that while we're here, it's the coolest thing!  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, we really can use this life so much for the better if we have some sense about who we really are. I feel because we can be more loving, and we can be more fearless, and we can grab life, you know? We don't have to be afraid. That's something I'm going to explore with you today.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay. Great. Wonderful. Was there a particular moment or something you always remembered since childhood? Can you please tell me about that?<br>
Yeah. I had no memory at all of my pre-human life between the ages of like 6 and 30. At the age of 30, I took up a long-term meditation practice. I was meditating every day, and I didn't expect anything, but I began to have non-physical experiences that were very brief at first but very eye-opening, very shocking.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As that began to happen, I also began to have this memory return, but I realized I had remembered it when I was a kid, and I had forgotten it, you know? I knew it was there before. So, it was just like getting uncovered, and, you know, it was so natural. It was not like a big "aha" thing. It was like, "Oh, that's always been there. I just didn't notice, you know?" It was very normal.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Pain of Remembering**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Pain_of_Remembering**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Pain of Remembering</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the contrast between physical and non-physical existence creates emotional turmoil, making the author long for the place he remembers but also appreciate the unique opportunity of human life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_contrast_between_physical_and_non-physical_existence_creates_emotional_turmoil,_making_the_author_long_for_the_place_he_remembers_but_also_appreciate_the_unique_opportunity_of_human_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the contrast between physical and non-physical existence creates emotional turmoil, making the author long for the place he remembers but also appreciate the unique opportunity of human life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Have you asked to remember?<br>
No. No, I definitely did not ask. In fact, I'm thankful that I don't remember more because the veil is very helpful. Sometimes I felt called to focus physically so that I can deepen my own veil and be more physically oriented. Because having some of that awareness can be very painful. There's a huge contrast between there and here. It's just so big. So it can really hurt. It can really hurt, you know, to remember some of that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I just miss it. I just miss it so much, but I know that this is a huge opportunity. So, I miss it so, so intensely, and some days I catch myself thinking like, "Oh, I just, you know, I wish I could be done," but immediately I reckon, "No, no. This human experience is such a precious, precious opportunity," and so I really want to use it the best while I am here. You know, I don't want to forsake it. It is a huge, huge opportunity. But yeah, having some of that awareness can just be painful because the homesickness is just very real.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">How did you say it? Do our best? Use it fully?<br>
Yeah.<br>
What's that for you?<br>
Yeah. Oh, man. I feel so much about this specific topic. There are a few really important aspects to it. One is that we really should do our best to try to meet life with love rather than fear. That's the main theme. And that means in any given choice, trying to make a choice that is based in love and all the things that love means, and not based in fear and all the ego reasons.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that alone unlocks life, you know? Just trying to act from love and vulnerability, and compassion and humility, and kindness and willingness. Just willingness alone. Just being willing to face our own crap, you know, face our own stuff. Just that alone is so powerful.  </p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="**The Role of Suffering**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Role_of_Suffering**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Role of Suffering</strong></h3><div class="heading-children"></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Where suffering is explored as an opportunity for spiritual expansion, a force that, when embraced, allows for the deepening of experience and the transformation of pain into wisdom." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_suffering_is_explored_as_an_opportunity_for_spiritual_expansion,_a_force_that,_when_embraced,_allows_for_the_deepening_of_experience_and_the_transformation_of_pain_into_wisdom."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where suffering is explored as an opportunity for spiritual expansion, a force that, when embraced, allows for the deepening of experience and the transformation of pain into wisdom.</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so that's kind of the main moral idea or ethical idea. But in a very tangible way, I can feel the contrast of the physical. And what I mean by that is that like human life offers a counter pressure or a counter current, maybe. Like if there's a river with a current coming at you, you can swim into the current. It's kind of like that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Our circumstances are the counter pressure. So all the challenges of our life, you know, the biological context, and the social context, and the financial context, and the psychological context, all the contexts that we're working with and engaging every day, that is the opportunity. In those contexts is the opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So how can we best use that? It really helps to not fight any of it and just to really, really experience. Really know, really feel all of it. Really allow ourselves to know it and not struggle against it, not fight it. Because even when pain arises, we actually don't need to fight the pain. I know this is hard to say we don't need to fight pain.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because even pain, when it arises, many times our pain is asking for our attention and our love and our feeling. And I like the phrase, "You feel it to heal it," because when we're willing to really sit with what is in us, sit with what's arising and look square at it without the stories, you don't need all the stories of the thinking mind. Feel. Feel what is there. Then it's very liberating.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because at first, our fear, because we avoid these pains because we're afraid, you know? We have perceptions that we buy into here that are not in alignment with who we really are. So we may buy into the perception of "I am not worthy of love." It's a common one on earth. Or the perception of "I have no power," or the perception "I am not free," or "I'm shameful." These are really big common themes on earth.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But when we do that, we react in fear because that's not really who we are. Who we really are is powerful, free, we are joyful spirit itself. So when we buy into a perception that is not in alignment with who we really are, we can experience fear. And we're so resistant to feeling that that we lock it away under hundreds of layers of ego and story, and we try to.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then so much of our lives becomes, "How do we plug that gap? How do we fill that hole? What thing can I get? What drug can I get? What relationship can I get? What, you know, whatever." We seek, seek, seek all the time rather than fully allowing even our deepest fear and our deepest darkness. If it arises, we don't have to go find it. It will arise. If it's in us, it'll arise at one point or another.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when it does, just being willing to fully feel that and know it. So when you do that, it might feel like a tornado, like a windstorm that's going to pick you up and kill you, smash you. It's so painful, it's so fearful, it's so dark. It will just crush me. Well, it will feel like that, maybe. But after the tornado picks you up and throws you around and you hit the ground, you realize not only are you still there, you are free now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because now the pain has expressed, and the wind loses its momentum and it can go away. And then it's just peace, and the joy that was always you is what's left. Joy is always on the other side of that which we fear.  </p></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="**Facing Deep Fear**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Facing_Deep_Fear**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Facing Deep Fear</strong></h3><div class="heading-children"></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Where the author describes his journey through trauma, explaining that the deepest healing comes from fully facing and integrating one's fears instead of suppressing them." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_author_describes_his_journey_through_trauma,_explaining_that_the_deepest_healing_comes_from_fully_facing_and_integrating_one's_fears_instead_of_suppressing_them."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the author describes his journey through trauma, explaining that the deepest healing comes from fully facing and integrating one's fears instead of suppressing them.</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so this thing – being with the fear, right? So how long do you actually stay with the fear? So something transforms? How many minutes?<br>
Oh, that's a good question. Okay, so I experienced a trauma when I was 22. That was extremely traumatizing for me, and I had post-traumatic stress for 7 or 8 years, and I couldn't even remember my life before the age of 22, really. That's how traumatized that was.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So it took me years of... I went through counseling called EMDR therapy, it's a form of counseling. And I found fear layer after fear, after fear, down, down, down, down, down. And every time I found a new fear, I thought, "Oh, that's got to be the root. That's got to be the real fear."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I'm saying this as a background because it took me years in earth time to go through all these layers. But... this is important. At the very bottom, the deepest, darkest, most terrifying fear, I only needed to really feel for a few seconds, but I really needed to feel it. But it took years for my ego to even let me find it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But then once I found it, it was breathtakingly low vibration, very fearful, but I didn't... when I found it, I just let it, and then after it's known, it's not... it's okay. You're still there, it's okay. Like, you're being... I'll put it this way: your consciousness, your being is deeper than the deepest fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Wow.<br>
So it doesn't take long. Now, maybe it'll take more than a few seconds, maybe a couple minutes or something, but it's just about the act of being with it and honoring it and knowing it that can heal it and release it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, like I said, the ego covers it up, so it's not like you can just go sit down right now and say, "Okay, I'm gonna go face my deepest fear."<br>
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.<br>
But when you're willing and when you really are ready to do the work, so when you're ready to do this, the universe wants to help you because this is part of what we're doing here. Spirit will help you to face, to heal, and to face your crap.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So when you're willing to really own your own issues, they will come up for you as you're able to handle them. The deeper parts of you know what you can handle now. So you'll get the next idea, which will be very, very, very hard, but that's okay. That's a good, important step, and it just happens very naturally as long as you're willing to always face and feel and not run away from you, from yourself.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I say yourself because it's not the true you, the real you. There's nothing to run from in yourself, but in your own psyche, I mean, in human personality. The human personality gets identified with the story very deeply. And so we need to be willing to own our role in our own story. When were we the bad guy? When have I been afraid? How have I not been loving to the person next to me?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like sometimes someone will have a theme in their life, and someone will tell them, maybe 5 or 6 or 7 people, especially romantic partners. It seems to be where it's most easily discovered what your problem is. Your weakness gets shown to you, and most people go, "Oh no, that's not my problem." Well, if you really listen and feel and own it, then you'll have the opportunity to do that.  </p></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="**Safety and the Illusion of Danger**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Safety_and_the_Illusion_of_Danger**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Safety and the Illusion of Danger</strong></h3><div class="heading-children"></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Where the idea of true safety is explored, as the author asserts that nothing can truly harm the essence of who we are, even though earthly experiences may create the illusion of danger." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_idea_of_true_safety_is_explored,_as_the_author_asserts_that_nothing_can_truly_harm_the_essence_of_who_we_are,_even_though_earthly_experiences_may_create_the_illusion_of_danger."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the idea of true safety is explored, as the author asserts that nothing can truly harm the essence of who we are, even though earthly experiences may create the illusion of danger.</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Is it always safe to face all the layers?<br>
Yeah, always, always, always. Always safe. We are never not safe. The perception of being in danger is local to earth. It's something we learn because we're biological, and we see a world where the body can actually be killed. It's very, very extreme, right? And we feel pain, physical pain, you know? Somebody stabs us, my goodness, that really hurts, so I'm afraid of that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So we live in a world where we're kind of conditioned, not only in our lives but even in our collective consciousness over the course of thousands of years of evolving in this world. We live with the idea of danger very deeply, but truly there is nothing that is actually harmful to us, to who we really are, to our spirit. We can't actually be harmed.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We may experience lots of pain temporarily. We may even be deeply damaged human personality for a while, that's possible. Many people get very damaged. But who we really are cannot truly be damaged. Who we really are is always free and full of all life – life with a capital L. And we always are healed in the end. There's no such thing as true damage.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So because of that, when pain arises, we don't need to be afraid of any of it. </p></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Necessity of Forgetting**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Necessity_of_Forgetting**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Necessity of Forgetting</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the veil of forgetfulness is explained as an intentional part of the human experience, allowing us to fully engage in our lives without the distractions of our eternal identity." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_veil_of_forgetfulness_is_explained_as_an_intentional_part_of_the_human_experience,_allowing_us_to_fully_engage_in_our_lives_without_the_distractions_of_our_eternal_identity."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the veil of forgetfulness is explained as an intentional part of the human experience, allowing us to fully engage in our lives without the distractions of our eternal identity.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Do you remember it in your everyday life? Do you remember this? That you are all of this!  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I often forget. I have a sticky note above my computer. I wrote on it while I was in a state where I truly knew that this is all an illusion, and I wrote, "It is an illusion," on the sticky note and I put it above my monitor. And there must have been 200 times since then, but I look up and go, "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it's an illusion," because I get pulled back in like everybody else.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, we get pulled in, pulled in, pulled in. That's normal. That's the way this world is to be, you know? We are immersed in the human character.<br>
I love that you wrote that note from that state, you know? So you kind of get that energy together with the note. It's not just a sticky note.<br>
Exactly. I love that. I knew that I would forget.<br>
Yeah, right. Because we all do, right? We all do. We are all in a state of forgetfulness to some degree while we're on earth, you know? That's just how it is. That's almost required for the earth experience because it's impossible to remember all that freedom, beauty, etc., and go through this, right?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You wouldn't be the human you if you were the larger you. If you want to be the human you, you have to be the human. You gotta be the human. You gotta be in the perspective of the human. You have to forget all the rest and just be you, be Anya, be whoever is listening to that. You need to be this character that you think has your name, and, you know, you're a male or female, and you have a job or whatever. You know, you have to really be in that perspective, and that is the value. That's where the value lies, is in the rich context of being that character.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then later, when you're done, you can honestly say, "I was that. I was that human. I know what it's like to be in pain. I know what it's like to be forgotten, or to be treated poorly, or not have money to buy things, whatever. I know because I did it. I was there. Like, I really was that." That requires you to really be failed so that you can deeply be in that perspective.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What was so fascinating is that when I heard your story, and your purpose was to come into this body to go through a specific type of fear, and that is the reason why all of this exists for you. Because we go for all these big things like, "Who am I?" and all of those: "I have to accomplish one million great things," and actually, actually, maybe that is really simple, that you are here just to have one particular experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't know, tell me about this?<br>
Yeah, yeah. So, okay. So the human mind likes to limit things because we think of one thing at a time, and, you know, we're really good at thinking about one thing at a time. While the soul is not limited.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So while that was definitely my primary intention to face, and integrate, and heal a very specific low vibration for the sake of expansion, while that was true, it was also so rich with possibility. All experience is beautiful, and all experience is a gift. So being given the precious opportunity to be the human and play the human character and have this experience, it's like, "Wow, what a gift."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that was my primary intention, of course, but there's so much more to it than just one intention. I will say though, on that topic, and this may be useful for some people, so as the soul evolves, its intentions for life engagement may become more specific. So in the beginning, any experience may be very useful, but then as we develop, it may be very specific things that, "Okay, now I really want to know that. Now I really want to experience that. Now I want to master that," and that just happens naturally as we progress, so to speak.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Purpose of Life**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Purpose_of_Life**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Purpose of Life</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where life is framed as an opportunity for the expansion of love and joy, emphasizing that human existence provides the necessary contrast for profound spiritual growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_life_is_framed_as_an_opportunity_for_the_expansion_of_love_and_joy,_emphasizing_that_human_existence_provides_the_necessary_contrast_for_profound_spiritual_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where life is framed as an opportunity for the expansion of love and joy, emphasizing that human existence provides the necessary contrast for profound spiritual growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, this whole subject of purpose, right? What's that? What is the purpose? What is the purpose, right? The purpose is the expansion of love and joy through the process of evolution, which is the integration of experience and the ability to meet rich contexts like this with love rather than fear. That's one big long sentence, but that's the short. That's the easiest way I can put it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We're here to integrate experience and grow in love. And as we grow in love, which conquering fear – not conquering is a bad word – integrating that, coming to terms with fear and healing it, is synonymous with love because our true nature is love. So when we're not hindered by fear, love is naturally what we are, and we can shine it more brilliantly, more beautifully.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So the purpose is to have a rich context through which we can make choices and integrate rich experience for the growth, for the expansion of love and joy. It's all about love. And also, we're super creative beings. We're very, very creative, like ridiculously creative. And we're so creative, and we're so bold in our creativity and our joy, that we even do this. We even come to be physical. It's like a work of art. Like being physical is like a living piece of artwork. I'll do that too, you know? It's beautiful.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Recognizing One’s Purpose**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Recognizing_One’s_Purpose**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Recognizing One’s Purpose</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where recurring life themes and challenges are presented as clues to one's spiritual purpose, helping individuals recognize their personal paths of growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_recurring_life_themes_and_challenges_are_presented_as_clues_to_one's_spiritual_purpose,_helping_individuals_recognize_their_personal_paths_of_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where recurring life themes and challenges are presented as clues to one's spiritual purpose, helping individuals recognize their personal paths of growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">How does someone remember their purpose, do you think?<br>
I think that's so personal that I don't think there's any one thing that can be said. But I'll just say two things. Okay, so first of all, I think it's really helpful to gain familiarity with what you really are, which is your awareness itself. Not your thoughts. And that's why meditation can be so helpful for many people.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, we talk about meditation like an activity. It's not really an activity. It starts as an activity, but putting aside the time to go look, go investigate what is your living consciousness itself. Go see, just go see, underneath the thoughts. It's okay if the thoughts keep coming, coming, coming. That's fine. Still, keep returning. Feel. What are you really?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Gaining that familiarity with your awareness itself is really powerful because as you do that, the thoughts lose their momentum. As you practice meditation, thoughts lose their oomph. And then the larger parts of you rise up on their own. And so in that, it can be easier to discern what's really going on.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because while we're really wrapped up in the thinking, the whole world is just to think the thoughts, you know? Like, "I gotta pay the bill. I don't like how this person treated me. Blah, blah, blah." All the thoughts, that's all. That's like our whole life, you know? So we need to give some space and be alert and alive and present in a way that is beyond the thinking. Just be.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that's the first general comment. The second, more specific comment then is that most people's purpose, I feel, that most people's purpose is kind of made apparent to them because it keeps coming up over and over again in some way in their life. So if we come to deal with something, usually that something is like our biggest problem. Or it's a problem that – oh man, it just keeps coming back and hitting me over and over and over.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I keep having the same feeling come back, or I keep having the same kind of relationship, or I keep having this same relationship with a substance or something, you know? Or there's a physical limitation that I've been dealing with my whole life, whatever. It's not always the case. I'm just saying that many times what we're here to deal with is very much a part of our lives, you know, because we're efficient with how we use our experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So it can help to pay attention to the recurring feedback.<br>
That's good advice.<br>
But it's very personal because each person's relationship with the Divine is very personal. Each person, each being is so beautifully unique. Okay, I know when we look at each other, we see relatively similar bodies, you know? We all have two eyes and a head, and we got shoulders and, you know, other things.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Each one of our souls is so unique, like a universe unto itself of new different colors, and sounds, and textures, and motivations, and history, so much history and so many qualities, and personality. Such a unique vibration, just put it that way. Each soul is known in a very, very, very personal, unique, never to be replicated way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So because of that, I say all that in the context of your question because of that, each person's relationship with the Divine or with themselves, with their Higher Selves, will be unique.<br>
Wow.<br>
One body is young, one's old, one's black, one's white, whatever. It's okay. We all are spirits playing these things. We're like playing characters on a stage. We don't need to... it's the ego that immediately says, "Well, I compared to you am this certain way."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Why does the ego do that? Because now he's trying to claim power. You're trying to claim power so you feel better about this deep, deep fear.  </p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="**Inspiration and the Power of Choice**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Inspiration_and_the_Power_of_Choice**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Inspiration and the Power of Choice</strong></h3><div class="heading-children"></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Where inspiration is explained as a deep connection to our true self, and the importance of personal choices in shaping our reality is emphasized." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_inspiration_is_explained_as_a_deep_connection_to_our_true_self,_and_the_importance_of_personal_choices_in_shaping_our_reality_is_emphasized."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where inspiration is explained as a deep connection to our true self, and the importance of personal choices in shaping our reality is emphasized.</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another question is about inspiration. I mean, when I heard your story, I was like, "Gosh, this is just such beauty." What is inspiration in its very essence, like to be so inspired to do so much for that? Can you share with me what is inspiration for you and how does it feel?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, yeah. Because I just think that you are the best person to talk about inspiration.<br>
Oh, thank you.<br>
So inspiration is what we feel when we are connecting back to our true selves. We're reminded of who we really are in a way that... because we really, really, really want to know and return to the total freedom and joy of what we are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So when we see something that reminds us of that true nature, our true creator or our true creative nature, some aspect of our true nature, when we're reminded of that, we feel inspired, you know? Like you might see a beautiful piece of art or hear a beautiful piece of music. Oh my Gosh, music inspires me deeply, you know? I hear music, and it's like...  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are beings of vibration, you know? Consciousness engages realities through all sorts of different kinds of vibrations – sound, sight, even sight, you know, of course, is colors, is vibration. So when we feel it in ourselves and we feel a certain vibration, it reminds us, "Oh, I am that, you know? That's in me."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's beautiful. It's ineffable. There's no description for the power and the joy of what we really are. So we are inspired by things that connect us to that or remind us of that.  </p></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Pre-Birth Planning**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Pre-Birth_Planning**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Pre-Birth Planning</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the author describes the process of selecting experiences and challenges before birth, tailoring them to the soul’s growth intentions." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_author_describes_the_process_of_selecting_experiences_and_challenges_before_birth,_tailoring_them_to_the_soul’s_growth_intentions."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the author describes the process of selecting experiences and challenges before birth, tailoring them to the soul’s growth intentions.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">How did you meet that being? I mean, how did this moment feel?<br>
Yeah, so the moment you're referencing is in my pre-birth experience. Long time, ancient, ancient times ago, long time ago, before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical, and he was so... Okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In those reality systems, at least where I was then, you can fully sense and know the quality of the being of those you are with. Like, that's one of the things that we really love doing and that we enjoy is sharing our quality, feeling each other. And I felt what he was, and he was incredibly powerful, and free, and full of joy, and he had so much wisdom.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the quality of his nature was just so potent and rich and capable. It's very hard to describe. There's not a lot of good words at all for this. And so I was inspired because I sensed... like I asked him, "How is it even possible that you are this? How is that possible?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And he shared with me – I'll put it in a unique way that he had used the contrast of the physical. I mean, he didn't put it that way, but what I'm just saying that is what's important to know about it. Is that he had experienced a physical life, many, many physical lives, but in one in particular, he was very damaged. He had a lot of pain, and it lasted with him for years and years. I mean, just terrible pain.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the quality with which he met that experience allowed him to refine in the most beautiful way – not that the pain did it. It's that he worked with the pain, or his relationship with that moment was still in love somehow. And when he could do that, then what it meant was the substance of who he was was refined.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's kind of like... this is a very, very crude metaphor, but it's a very simple metaphor. I think it works okay. If you go for a run, you know, you put stress on your body. Your body gets stronger, and then when you go back home, now you are more capable, and you've gone and experienced something that is new, and now the couch is more comfortable in a way that it wasn't before, and you're stronger. You have more stamina, and you have more... like the body of what you are is just has been grown.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And lifting weights is kind of like that, you know? Like, why would you ever lay down and push up a heavy object? Why would you ever do that? That sounds crazy. Well, it's because the contrast, the weight, the counter pressure of the weight makes your body respond in a way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So consciousness is kind of like that, where we engage the experience of contrast, and that contrast itself is the counter pressure through which we can grow if we were able to respond in love and if we were able to accept and integrate that experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sometimes we don't do that. Sometimes we respond in fear, and fear takes over, and we resist, and we fight, and we struggle, and then we don't make a lot of progress because this is hard, you know? Earth is super high contrast, but anyway.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This being, he most certainly had done that. He grew in the most beautiful way. And I was very inspired because I was like, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I want to be that, feel that, know that." And so that set me down a very, very long path.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I had mentioned this story several times before. I heard this, but I'm reminded now of something that Bob Monroe, the famous out-of-body explorer, said. He said something to the effect of, "Many of us come and begin to go through the physical incarnation process because we come across a being who has graduated from the earth experience, and they're so powerful, and they're so full of knowing and experience and love and joy, that we say metaphorically, 'I'll do anything to do that. Show me, show me, show me what I'll do.'"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I relate to that. Like, I remember feeling like, "Whatever it takes, I want to go through that." Of course, now that we're here in the muck, you know, down in the contrast, it's hard, you know? And that was actually something that he communicated to me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">At first, he kind of, you know, because there the communication is very honest, and there's not like social pretense. There's no politeness, you know? You don't have to play. So this message at first was like kind of brushing me off, like, "That's what they all say. It's hard in a way you don't know." Like, communicating, "You don't know how hard this is."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And at the time, I was like, "I'll do it. I don't care how hard it is. I'll do it, you know?" I was super excited. I'm here now. We're here now. This life can be hard. I know, very, very hard at times. But it is in that there's so much opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that was the first inspiration. I'm just trying to speak to your question. I shouldn't say the first, first. That was my first inspiration before my physical incarnations. I existed before that.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Understanding Deep Suffering**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Understanding_Deep_Suffering**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Understanding Deep Suffering</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where pain and suffering are presented as opportunities for growth, but not as necessary or desirable experiences, emphasizing the human tendency to resist hardship." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_pain_and_suffering_are_presented_as_opportunities_for_growth,_but_not_as_necessary_or_desirable_experiences,_emphasizing_the_human_tendency_to_resist_hardship."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where pain and suffering are presented as opportunities for growth, but not as necessary or desirable experiences, emphasizing the human tendency to resist hardship.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Does it mean that like all the bad things that are happening to us are actually not so bad? They're all opportunities?<br>
You know, we're not... okay, so it's not the correct, it's not the right way for us to act in fear and hurt each other. That is not our calling. Our calling is to be loving beings, not fearful beings.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm saying that first because we're not supposed to make the journey more difficult for each other. We're not supposed to hurt each other. But when challenge arises, it is an opportunity for growth. We can use the contrast when it comes.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And you know what? And it's even okay if we can't. It's even okay if there's a challenge that's too big at the moment. Actually, there's nothing too big for you. That's at the base level. Nothing is too big. But if it feels too big, if it seems too big, if it seems too hard, that's okay. Have mercy on yourself. Be gentle with yourself.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is not an easy journey, walking the physical.<br>
Is it necessary for you, let's say, to go through many years of some dark experiences in order to... or maybe it's possible to reduce? I mean, is it important to have much of that?<br>
I will never say that it is important that we go get suffering or that we go suffer. Suffering is going to happen because we have yet to evolve. That's going to happen already because suffering is what happens when fear happens, and fear happens when we have not yet evolved enough to meet this context with love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Loving beings, evolved beings, can meet a given context and not have fear. That's possible. But for those of us who have fear and the pain of it, it is an opportunity when the contrast arises.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I'm being careful how I say that because I don't want to communicate that suffering is good.<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.<br>
That's not the case because it's not necessary. It's actually not even necessary, but when it arises, why? What is it teaching? What is the fear that is allowing you to suffer? Or if it's a pain, what is your relationship with that present moment when the pain is there, like if it's a physical pain?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like a couple years ago, I had a very painful physical condition. My gallbladder was failing. It was ridiculously painful for about six weeks, and I was in tears throughout the day every day. And, you know, it's not my first very painful experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I tried to, when the pain was at its worst, look at it in a way that is not labeling, not interpreting it. It's just a sensation, a very strong sensation, but it's just a sensation that I put the meaning on. I get to assign what is this, what does this mean, and what am I feeling.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it's okay if it feels really strong. It's okay if it's hard. Be gentle with yourself. This is like seriously deep stuff we're doing here on earth. This is not like kindergarten. This is for the very daring beings who are willing to go through this much rigor. That's us. That's you, whoever is listening.

That's all you have to do is meet the moment. You don't have to worry about the whole thing. Just meet your moment, right now. If and if there's some kind of suffering in it, what is your relationship to it?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Can you see it without labeling it, without grabbing it? Can you just know it? Can you just let it be in you, of you? If you do that deeply enough, you will, you may, and may and will even find an underneath it all, who you really are, the one that's knowing it, is always of joy and bliss, always.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, you may not tangibly find that. Of course, I have suffered much. But it is possible to find when you accept all of it. All of it is taking place within that which is good and that which is fundamentally of joy. Like, we are always beings of love and joy.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You take the darkest person on the earth at their deepest root. They want love. They need love. They are searching for love. They love love because they are love. Like, at the deepest level, that unity, that connectedness, that acceptance is what we all are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We're just pretty unevolved compared to how we might be someday. And so we make a lot of fearful choices every day. And we hurt each other all over the place. We are like a bunch of children running around. You know, the human race is at a relatively young stage in its evolution.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And we are currently hurting each other, hurting the planet, you know? We're just kind of focused on these very short-term ideas, consumerism and materialism, and buy the next thing, and try to take the next, drink the next caffeine, or take the next drug, you know, whatever. Just... we are not as a species fully there yet.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But when those challenges arise, it is an opportunity.<br>
Beautiful.<br>
And what is earth for you? Because you said somewhere that the earth is so beautiful, but it just felt there was more to that. What's your perception of earth?<br>
Yeah, okay. So there are many, many opportunities we can engage, physical opportunities, even just in our universe. And there are many universes. Very, very many, very, very huge, huge multiverse.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And earth is like a tiny little piece, but earth is very precious and unique because earth is one of the most... special. I don't know, the words are really poor. I have felt that the earth is very precious in the opportunity of what we're doing in this play.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, the human race, especially where we are right now, is in a very interesting time and a very interesting... the simulation is very rich and good. And now we're trying some rather extreme things. We're trying to integrate some extreme vibrations. We're trying to grow up in big step ways in a short amount of time.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And earth is the place to do that. So if you are given a chance to play a character on earth and be a human, it is like the most precious gift. It's like me like... wow, really? I get to play? Oh my Gosh!  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Even though, you think a lot of humans, there's billions of us. There's way more spirits than there are humans, than there are slots. And so having the chance to play this character, it's just so precious, and it's such an opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And you know, we often don't think about that now that we're here, and many of us are just trying to get through our suffering. I know. But it really is a precious opportunity.<br>
For everyone?<br>
Everyone. Absolutely everyone. Even being an animal on earth is a huge, huge opportunity.<br>
Really?<br>
Yeah, to be able to be a dog in someone's family and love them, and you know... wow, like, that's huge. It's all very significant.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Everybody who's listening today is significant. Like, you really are. I'm not just saying. You're very significant, wherever you are. You're very precious and important. And what you decide to do with your time here in the small ways is very important and powerful and precious.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If you can choose love over fear, if you can be your creative, if you can be yourself, your real self, in some way, some small way... wow. That's using this opportunity for what it's meant to be.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's amazing. Like, the only failure that we really can have when this is over is wasted opportunity. Like, we can't actually fail what we're doing here. It's a big play. We have fear. It's okay. On the other side, it's known. We're really trying something difficult. Everything is understood.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We can't truly fail, but we can waste the opportunity. That happens, and that is a source of sorrow, so to speak. Not really sorrow, but it's a source of disappointment on the other side, you know, if you waste your time here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Wow. It's just so much. Like, I'm taking that in. You know, some moments, you just want to have that stillness and just really take it in.<br>
I love the stillness. I'm happy to have no conversation. Just listeners can't hear much if there's no speaking. Maybe feel much.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I so love your message about small moments and how... and even you were sharing a story like how... well, in English, I won't be able to say the story as beautiful as you did, but there was a story of someone who was reviewing their life, and then they remembered that it was... the whole life... the most beautiful, celebrated moment of their life was...  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Do you want to tell the story?<br>
Yeah, when they watered a tree.<br>
Yeah, I apologize that I don't remember whose NDE this was because I keep mentioning this. I should probably look it up and remember, but there was an NDE where a person had a life review, and they were aware of how important it was that they had this one moment when they were young when their family was on vacation or something, I think they said, and they stopped, and their parents asked them to go take a bucket of water down to a river or a stream and fetch water.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then when they were carrying the bucket of water back to the car, they noticed a dry tree out of their way, and they took the time to go out of their way and dump some of the water onto the tree before making their way back to the car.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And they didn't think anything of it, but they did it selflessly, you see? It was just unconditional. It was just, "I'm just going to water this tree." That's love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's beautiful. Like, you don't even need to be with other people to meet a moment with love. The universe can hear you. You know, consciousness can hear you. You're a part of it. You are it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So if you can even... you're in your bathroom brushing your teeth, and you have a thought arise. Can you be merciful in yourself and can you love the person for just a moment? Recognize how someone is criticizing you. Why are they, you know, feel, I don't know, whatever small way, even in your own heart and mind, that you can choose love is beautiful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, we think in big terms while we're human. We think we have to move around all these objects and make money and buy things and own things and write books and all these things. We don't need to do any of that. We just need to be. We just need to be loving.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If we can be in love with reality for even some time, we will have fulfilled our purpose.<br>
Really?<br>
Yeah, even appreciating a sunset or something like that.<br>
If someone has many gifts and has come here with great potential, does it mean that they are there to share it all with the world? Or does it mean that this design has to be fulfilled? Do the gifts have to be used?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes. We are responsible for who we are, put it that way.<br>
Wow! Wait, wait, wait. We are responsible for who we are.<br>
I love that.<br>
So if you have a gift, you're responsible for using it.<br>
Right.<br>
Really?<br>
Yeah, but it's okay. I mean, I'm saying that simply in the broad sense that everything that we are, we're responsible for.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, let's say you have a friend, and the friend tells you something personal about themselves, and now you have some power over them because they told you a secret. So now you have to decide how you're going to use that new knowledge. You can use it lovingly and support them and accept their vulnerability and honor it. Or maybe one day you're feeling a little egoic, and you gossip about your friend, and it ends up hurting them. You're responsible for that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Right.<br>
So the same thing is that... so that's just a piece of knowledge, but the same thing is basically true of even our abilities. Like, as we grow, we become more aware, more capable.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm being careful not to categorically say, you know, if you're good at this thing, you better go use it. I'm not saying that. You have total free will. You have total choice how to use your life. I'm simply saying that we're responsible for who we are, so do your best in all ways that you can.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We should utilize our context the best way we can even if we don't know why the context is what it is, because of course, we don't remember our pre-life planning most of the time. So people will say, "Well, I don't know what I signed up for. So what am I supposed to do?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Use your contexts. That's it. What I mean is, if you're like... whatever, if you have health issues, or if you're in a certain family, or if you're in a certain country, or if you have certain abilities or certain weaknesses, just do your best to use that context and be the real you in it, and try to choose love rather than fear in it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If you do that, you'll find your way to what you are trying to do because ultimately, all this is about love. Love means so many things, and it means the exploration of so many kinds of experience. So I'm not just categorically saying one kind of love. I mean all the things that love can mean. If you are genuine, it's the best word.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If you can be genuine and authentic with how you meet your experience and you own your own crap in your context, then that should be... so that is very powerful. And if you have talents that you came in to use, then you will be aware of those talents. You will have recognized them probably, and if you feel called to use them, use them.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Spiritual Communication and Awareness**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Spiritual_Communication_and_Awareness**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Spiritual Communication and Awareness</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where communication with guides is explained as a constant process, often unnoticed due to the distractions of daily thoughts and fears." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_communication_with_guides_is_explained_as_a_constant_process,_often_unnoticed_due_to_the_distractions_of_daily_thoughts_and_fears."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where communication with guides is explained as a constant process, often unnoticed due to the distractions of daily thoughts and fears.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another question is about communication with your Higher Self, with your teachers, your guides, your... how do you call them? And what's your way to like to establish that communication so that it really happens?<br>
It does happen.<br>
All the time?<br>
It happens all the time, whether we're aware of it or not is another story. I only rarely have those kinds of exchanges. I do have those kinds of exchanges occasionally, but they are very real.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'll just say two things for how we can encourage that exchange. Okay, first of all, you kind of lumped the Higher Self and spirit in general in one bucket. I'm just speaking in general to interacting with spirit, so other beings or guidance from the spirit or guides who are trying to help us, trying to perceive that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So two thoughts. One, I will re-mention meditation because if we're like totally listening to our thoughts all day, we're lost in the dreams of thinking. We're not going to get anything because we're too busy associating with the next thing all day long. We're caught up in a thought.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So if we can spend time letting go of all that, all the thoughts, all the need to listen to the story, don't, don't. Just give yourself a period of time – 5 minutes or 20 minutes or 40 minutes or an hour – just block off time and just be with your awareness and give yourself permission to let go of the entirety of the story.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So as you do that, there's this spaciousness that grows that you are, that you can feel. And in that spaciousness is a space for that communication to happen much more easily because you're not stuck, lost in the thinking.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's the first thing. The second thing I would say is... okay, vibrationally, we're like super low while we're on earth in general, but our vibration changes depending on what perspective we are entertaining.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So if we're thinking, "I'm worthless, I'm powerless, I'm ugly," whatever, then that's a low vibration, and that makes the distance... okay, let's go this way. If source is here, and they're in the realms of... this is just not really how it is, but source is here, and the realms of spirit are, you know, maybe here, and we're all the way out here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I'll move over a little bit. So if we are entertaining a low vibration perception, we are inadvertently increasing the distance vibrationally. Like, when you feel low, and you feel pain, when you feel fear, that is because you are vibrationally distant.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The neurochemistry will immediately reflect it. I mean, it's in your brain too, of course, because you're physical. But I'm saying if you think, "I'm powerless," distance increases. But on the other hand, if you really feel grateful, or you recognize the love in the world, the love in yourself, or you appreciate beauty, you are naturally, automatically increasing your vibration back up.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I'm mentioning that in the context of this question because they are so high vibration. They have to like kind of come down. So if we can go up, and they can come down, there's a place to meet vibrationally in the middle.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so that is one reason that I feel that... I feel that mediums who are real and genuine are usually people who are very evolved. They've met a lot of fear, and they generally are very loving and real, you know? They don't do it as just like an activity or skill because usually if that's it's just like an exercise, that's usually a lower... you know, usually there's some ego service going on there, and that's not very high vibration.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But if the desire to serve and connect is genuine, then the vibration is higher. So that's a place meeting, place for it.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Power of Love in Spiritual Connection**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Power_of_Love_in_Spiritual_Connection**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Power of Love in Spiritual Connection</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where love is described as the ultimate bridge between the physical and spiritual realms, allowing for deeper connections with guides and those who have passed." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_love_is_described_as_the_ultimate_bridge_between_the_physical_and_spiritual_realms,_allowing_for_deeper_connections_with_guides_and_those_who_have_passed."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where love is described as the ultimate bridge between the physical and spiritual realms, allowing for deeper connections with guides and those who have passed.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, and one other thing, when your guard is down. That's kind of an example of the first one where you're not lost in thought. Like, a lot of people say like someone will pass, like a loved one will pass, and then two months later, they'll be in the shower or something, where they're just letting go, they're vulnerable, they're not thinking, they're just in the shower, and all of a sudden, they'll have like something like a message, or they'll feel their presence or something, you know?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's kind of common to hear that because their guard is down. They're not associated with the grief thoughts all... you know, this moment, they're just being, and there's a space.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And by the way, while I mention that, this isn't your question, but I'll just mention this. The love that we have for each other is a very powerful bridge, very powerful connection. So when someone dies, not really a big deal in consciousness space. In the physical, of course, it's a terrible loss.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But in the field of awareness itself and consciousness, we are very much connected to those that we love and those who love us. And even one loving thought, just one thought, is enough that they can kind of like follow back and come with us and be with us and maybe even try to communicate with us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Whether we perceive it or not is another story. We're in a super low vibration place, so we often miss it. We're too dense, so dense, but loving thoughts are like... I heard there's one channeled source I really love named Silver Birch. I love Silver Birch, and he said something like, "We perceive your loving thoughts like sound on the wind, that we can follow to you."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, I love that.<br>
And that is something I resonate with. That loving connection is a powerful bridge. So I'm just mentioning that for anybody who may be in grief right now, that you haven't lost those. We can't lose those we love. It's not possible.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No.<br>
We can't lose them. We will grieve in the physical because we may not see them physically again for a lifetime, of course. But that's just a temporary play. This is like a dream. It's going to end. And when it's over, those relationships are still there. They're still real. We can still further them later. We still go do things together. In fact, the thing is, love is what we are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So and love is in relationship. So it's precious when we have loving relationships. Like, even a small amount of love on earth that binds two people together can feel very potent and strong in the non-physical.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so big relationships, deep relationships between spouses, or family members, or close friends, those are some powerful bonds. So it doesn't mean that everyone who we love... I mean, our relatives, I mean, people who have passed... so everyone who is no longer with us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So do we just send loving thoughts all the time? Do we send loving thoughts all the time?<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you can if you want. You don't have to because your true nature is known and seen. So they already know. If they want to come spend their time in that way... I mean, I'm putting it in a human way now because it's all... there's no linear time on that side. It's connected.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But if they want to do that, then yes, they can see and sense and feel exactly like... in spirit, there are no secrets. There's everything is seen. Everything's known. Everything's open. You can't hide who you are, you know? And you can't hide how you really feel about people and how they feel about you. And if there's real love, it's real.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Right.<br>
It's like... I just feel that we are trying to put like really big things, and I know, I know I hate trying to do it because trying to take words and like I shove these things into words, it doesn't work. But still, if someone who's listening can feel maybe what we're talking about, then that's awesome.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But that raises the vibration like I was saying, you know? Just even you and I having this conversation, other people listening, it's like an energetic opportunity. You know, people's vibration gets raised, and then the non-physical friends, our guides, they can even use that. They can be like, "Oh, look, see, that's available now. That's good. That's great. Let's do that. Let's use that. Let's help nudge these people in the right direction and encourage them."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So much encouragement is actually coming our way, if you can feel it or not.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**What the Soul Is**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**What_the_Soul_Is**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>What the Soul Is</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the soul is defined as both a unique expression of consciousness and an inseparable part of the whole, transcending physical identity." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_soul_is_defined_as_both_a_unique_expression_of_consciousness_and_an_inseparable_part_of_the_whole,_transcending_physical_identity."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the soul is defined as both a unique expression of consciousness and an inseparable part of the whole, transcending physical identity.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And if I ask you, what is the soul?<br>
Thus, so on earth, we like to think of reality like things, you know? Like, there's trees, and there's rocks, and there's tables, and there's houses, and cars, and bodies, and... so if you want to know what one thing, and then there's ideas too. So then we want to know if... what if there's this thing and there's this, what thing is this thing like? Because if I can correlate them, now I know. Is it like this or is it like that?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, the problem is... well, not the problem, the situation is that consciousness itself, spirit itself transcends all of the form. It's bigger than all of the form, so there isn't really any form we can use to identify it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so but that being said, we'll at least try to use a parable or another metaphor because metaphors are the best way we can try to talk about these things sometimes.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I like the metaphor of the ocean and the drop of water in the ocean. I write about this in my book. If the ocean is all that is, and that source, and we are, and then we are a drop in the ocean, so we are a part of it. Is there really a separation between the drop and the ocean? No, it's a part of the ocean. It can't really be separate.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But in the ocean occur all sorts of things. Like, if you picture a physical ocean, you have currents, and you have changes in salinity and temperature, and there's lots of things happening in the water, but it's all water. And that is like how our reality is. It's all water. It's all consciousness. It's all being experienced by consciousness within consciousness.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So what is the soul? The soul is the consciousness. It's the "I" that is knowing the form. It is the drop in the ocean.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I love the Rumi quote: "You are not just a drop in the ocean. You are the mighty ocean in the drop."<br>
I love that so much. I love it because, you know, we think, "Well, I'm just a small little human who can't pay their bills, you know, whatever," or "I'm this person with illness. That's all I am." That's not all you are. You're just having the deep dream of being that for the purposes of love, joy, and expansion of love and joy through evolution.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What you really are is one with the whole. We're all one. We're all connected to each other. We are both individuated – that means unique – and the whole. And so we just call the individuation a soul.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So you, the you that feels like you to you, is your soul. You are the you that feels like you to you, not the human identity, not the human character, not the name, the forms, the feelings, the sense data. You're not... you're just experiencing and using those things.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Eternal Nature of the Soul**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Eternal_Nature_of_the_Soul**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Eternal Nature of the Soul</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the permanence of the soul is affirmed, reinforcing that individuality and existence continue beyond the physical experience." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_permanence_of_the_soul_is_affirmed,_reinforcing_that_individuality_and_existence_continue_beyond_the_physical_experience."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the permanence of the soul is affirmed, reinforcing that individuality and existence continue beyond the physical experience.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And is this something that I'm going to be with always? I mean, not the form of it, but like the essence? It's like always, always?<br>
Okay, so when you ask yourself that question, what answer feels good?<br>
Yeah.<br>
Yes, always.<br>
Because that's the truth. If you consider these big spiritual ideas, if it doesn't feel comfortable, something's missing. We resonate with, we feel the best when we consider the most hopeful ideas because they are the truth. They are the root that we've come from.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so yes, that's not the only reason. I'm just saying that's just a gauge. But the truth feels good, right? I'm just saying that the truth feels good. The truth always feels good, the ultimate truth. It feels good in a way that's not just ego story.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ego stories can feel a little bit good, and they can be tricky. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about deep being level, that feeling right. So I'll just say the soul is that individuation. The uniqueness of you is precious. It's precious to the whole, very precious. In fact, you are deeply, deeply, deeply loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, not just as a generic thing, but because you're you. You're loved. You're just so loved.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that, of course, that's going to be upheld. Of course, that individuation is precious, and yes, you'll go on. And when you are past the human experience, then you just are in a much, much, much less constraining environment. You're much more yourself. Like, this state of being human is the less you state, you know?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are bound by the chemistry of the brain and all the limitations and the pains, and that's the weird... that's when you don't feel as much like yourself, but you're still you. I mean, you're you right now, and you'll be even more you when the limitations are let go, when you take off the heavy spacesuit and step out. You're still you. You're just not in a suit anymore.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So freeing. It's wonderful.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Love as the Ultimate Truth**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Love_as_the_Ultimate_Truth**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Love as the Ultimate Truth</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where love, joy, and freedom are revealed as the foundational essence of existence, and remembering this truth is presented as the core challenge of human life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_love,_joy,_and_freedom_are_revealed_as_the_foundational_essence_of_existence,_and_remembering_this_truth_is_presented_as_the_core_challenge_of_human_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where love, joy, and freedom are revealed as the foundational essence of existence, and remembering this truth is presented as the core challenge of human life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">How do you remember that you are loved? How do I remember or how do we remember? How do we... because you say this so beautifully. I mean, I know that just one thing to remember is to listen to you talking about that. It just immediately brings me back into this remembering.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Beautiful.<br>
But how else do we remember that while we're living our lives, that we are so deeply loved? How do we know that?<br>
Oh man, that is a very difficult question simply because the veil is organic. The veil means the forgetting of the fact we've agreed to forget what we are while we're here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The veil is very effective. Of course, it's ridiculously effective, but it's also organic, and it's not a hard rule. And so first, I'm just saying in the context of the question, be reminded that you are already on the other side too. You're already there. Your fullness of who you are is already what you are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's just we get wrapped into these stories of our lives. We believe so deeply in... especially the pain stories, that we don't feel that love actively on the human level anymore. So how can we feel it? That's a very personal question.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Just like I was saying, the soul is so unique, that the path of any individual soul back to know who they truly are, it's a very personal, individualized path. But in general, I think some of the other things we've already talked about can be helpful. Meditation can be helpful. Practicing, examining your intention to see where you're building love rather than fear can be really helpful because if you're loving the person next to you, you will feel love. I mean, right, that's actually true.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Or whereas, if you're being selfish and you're like trying to protect yourself, that hurts, and thinking itself actually hurts. Thinking all day long – think, think, think – that hurts. So that can be helpful too.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Meditation is one. Choosing love over fear is another. And then, I'd say also, okay, the physical is like a big mirror that reflects back to us what we believe about it, okay? So but it's also a really cool toy. The whole physical world is like a big toy.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So you can use the toy, and what I mean is, go play, have fun. Or you see something beautiful, go admire it. Wow, that's beautiful. Go look at that. Go spend time with it. Or I don't know, whatever experience you feel like you will most resonate with and brings you excitement, go do that, you know? Because that's okay. That's great. That helps us remember because when we are acting in love and in freedom, then we remember our love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Before this body, right? On the level of the soul, when I look at this life, when I plan, when I do, when I kind of design life, right? Do I do the details? How detailed do I do all of that? And then the question is, what if it's just out of my plan?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So in my pre-birth experience, I had an intention first. The intention was to meet this fear and integrate this low vibration and to really grow in that way. So then they brought me a life that was appropriate, like it would work.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It would be like they review... imagine like a database or something. They review it all, and they are skilled at, you know, taking like a package, like a life context, and being like, "Will that work for this for this being? Yeah. Is it hard? Yeah. Is it hard? Is it too hard, you know?" And they review all of it, but it's all tons of information is reviewed all at once, and then they bring it to you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then I reviewed it, and as I reviewed it, I could see. I could simultaneously review what would all the millions of possibilities of what might happen, and what was very likely or less likely to happen, but I also was able to make requests. So they were able to tweak it, you know, tweak the package.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And who are they?<br>
The guides. I don't know. I worked with a guide who is a very loving and wise being who knows me and knows... it's very wise. Wise is the best word. And so I worked with them. This one guide in particular, but them, a group of them. I asked for things, and I kind of... I made certain statements that I was just certain about, like, "I really want to be intelligent in this life because I really have appreciated being intelligent. I enjoy that quality. I don't really want to not be intelligent, you know?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That was one thing I mentioned, and they said, "You can do that. That's okay." And then I said like, "I want to not forget everything this time. I want to have a tiny, tiny, smallest sliver of memory. Can I do that?" And they said, "Yes, that will make the life more painful, more difficult," because I knew that the contrast would be even greater. I'd have to dive even deeper, and I'd have to be even more sensitive is the right word. I'd have to be very sensitive.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So but I knew that even that contrast was an opportunity for growth, so I accepted that. I said, "That's okay. I'll do that." And I knew that this body had a limitation that other bodies don't have, a biological limitation, a genetic limitation that would make my day-to-day experience difficult in a way that it's not for other people, but I knew that would actually be very useful for me because I knew that it would kind of pressure my ego or something. It would make sure that I didn't go too far on an ego path because the day-to-day limitation would humble me, which would be helpful so that I didn't turn into a monster, you know, that kind of thing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, I'm speaking generally. It's not... it's hard to put a lid on these things.<br>
I get it completely somehow.<br>
Yeah, okay, good. That's very, very complex.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So it was like a tree being laid on its side with millions of possibilities, and I knew that it was very likely that I would be crushed in my 20s by a trauma, and that happened as I mentioned. And I also knew that this lifetime I would be going much further out in a certain experiential direction than I had ever gone.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, this is a poor metaphor, but if you imagine like... imagine a home base in the middle, and then you go out into the wilderness like in different directions from the home base, and then you have little states like how far you made it out in all these different directions, something like that. Like, you went that way for two miles, and you went that way for five miles, and you went that way for six miles.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not exactly like this. I'm just using a metaphor. It was like there was one direction I was going to go that was way past the state that I already had, and I'm there now. Like, I'm at a place now that is very, very much further than what I could previously had. I have tolerated, but I've learned to do it. I'm trying to.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I reviewed all that context, so I had some input, but it was like the context existed. The body, the parents, I mean, the life was going to happen, and it didn't have to be me playing this character, but I was a good fit.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And actually, this life was not as good of a fit as the previous one that I attempted to use. I mentioned in my other talk that I inadvertently had ended prematurely because I responded in fear. So this life wasn't as good, but it was... it was still, it was good enough, you know? It was good. It was appropriate. It was like... I'm just throwing numbers out there, but if the first one was 99% appropriate, this one's like 86% or 87%, you know, whatever. Not perfect, but it's good.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Free Will and Unplanned Possibilities**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Free_Will_and_Unplanned_Possibilities**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Free Will and Unplanned Possibilities</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the balance between predestined experiences and free will is explored, showing that while souls plan their lives, they also create new possibilities along the way." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_balance_between_predestined_experiences_and_free_will_is_explored,_showing_that_while_souls_plan_their_lives,_they_also_create_new_possibilities_along_the_way."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the balance between predestined experiences and free will is explored, showing that while souls plan their lives, they also create new possibilities along the way.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But do you just live this life as it is, or you create things that maybe were not planned?<br>
Yes, you do create things that were not. So all what you're signing up for is a context, and then once you're in the context, you have free will. And that is what makes the physical experience so valuable, actually.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Is one of the things... there's a lot of things that make it very valuable, but one of the things that makes it so valuable is it provides novelty. What I mean is, unanticipated things happen because we're all making choices, and so the system is really good at predicting what's going to happen ahead of time. It's really good. It knows us really well. It knows you really well. It knows me really well. It knows all the information in the whole universe really, what he knows.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But the choices are free will, so things can happen that didn't maybe anticipate originally, and then you got to deal with that, and wow, that's exciting, you know what I mean? Because now you got to deal with like something, and you might make different choices once you're here, of course.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, the soul plan has made it higher at the soul level, but you as an individual, you are still your soul playing human character. So if you do it in a deep enough way... yeah, I mean, yeah, we do alter. We do make changes. So yes, we have freedom once we're here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so it's possible to create so many great things that at the end, you're just like, "Wow, so my lifetime is even better than my soul has planned."<br>
Yes.<br>
Yes, yes, exactly.<br>
Yeah, absolutely.<br>
I would love that.<br>
I would love that too. I really would love that.<br>
That's awesome. Maybe we're doing it right now together while we're having this conversation. Maybe it will right now. Maybe it will help nudge somebody.<br>
Wow, to have that freedom.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And, you know, also this moment when your life has stopped unexpectedly, right? When you stopped your life in a previous lifetime, it's an important question. I was thinking about that like because many people leave before maybe they are meant to, and so does it mean that... it's like, let's say they're depressed, or it's like temporary experiences are so overwhelming that they choose to go, but actually, there is so much beauty waiting for them just around the corner, for example, right? And meeting people, meeting all the opportunities, having so many contracts. Tell me about that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like I said, novelty is valuable. It is possible that plans are made, and they just don't come to fruition, and that's okay. If that happens, well, maybe we'll try again later. That's all right. We can do that. But meanwhile, the experience that remains is also valuable in a different way that may have been unanticipated.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Right.<br>
But also, I kind of want to say to the people who feel low or thinking of those kinds of thoughts, I just want to tell them that around the corner, there might be a completely different story.<br>
Yeah, absolutely.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What happens is, the more we're in fear, the smaller and smaller our... this is a term from Tom Campbell, the consciousness explorer... our decision space gets. In other words, the more that we focus on fear and pain, we tend to get to have less and less and less choices that we see. They're there. There are many choices there. And conversely, when we act in love and in vulnerability and in fearlessness, more and more choices become available.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So they may not see what's around the corner. I will also say this is very important for anyone who's suffering with deep, deep depression or feels suicidal. I have experienced incredible biochemical lows myself. They can be unbelievably painful, and when you're in the middle of them, it feels like it will never end, but that is a lie. The feeling that it will never end is a lie. It's the story of the fear and the story of the pain and the biochemistry.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Here's the thing – having a brain and a body is very persistent and limiting. If the brain has a certain biochemistry going on, it will affect, of course, very much what you experience. Like, if I take almost any medicine, any drugs, I cannot tolerate it. I will feel like I'm losing my mind, and I will be in a lot of pain, neurochemical pain, for a long time.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But that's because my brain is in that's... the energy state and the biochemical state of the brain. But I want to communicate to anyone who's in that deep, deep pain – it is not who you are. The pain is an experience you are having. There's a big difference there, and the you that is experiencing the pain can and will experience other much more wonderful things past the pain.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it takes... I'm not making light of it. I'm really... I know how deep, deeply painful it can be, and I even understand. I do not condone suicide. Suicide is not the way out. It's not. But I understand how people would reach that point when the pain seems like there's no escape.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But as you pointed out, there is always beautiful opportunity there waiting for us at every moment. And so we need to have an incredible amount of bravery to pick ourselves up off the ground and be like, "You know what? I hurt, but I'm gonna go live some life right now in whatever form that means." Maybe the only thing you have the strength to do is watch a TV show. That's okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, like, spirit knows you are. It's okay if your context is very limiting. That's totally okay. You get to choose how you meet that context. That's the key. The power of your intent, your choice, for this small, small moment, are you going to choose love or fear? Even self-love. Are you going to choose self-love or fear in this moment?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And if we can do that, what happens is we begin to change the momentum back towards the freedom and love, one bit at a time. Like, another thing is our one last comment about that. Our mind is very powerful because we're framing the entire experience. So if you decide, just decide, put your foot down. "I am going to reframe this experience right now." Decide. The pain is yelling at you: "You're terrible, you know, you the world is bad, you're stuck, you're worthless."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">NO. Use your intent. Use your will. You are the master. You're the captain of the ship. Your ship may be falling apart. You're the captain of the ship! Stand up! Claim your power. Reinterpret your experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There's so much power in that. There's so much power in that.

I'm talking about the movement of consciousness itself when you... how do you meet your moment? That's what I'm talking about at the deepest, deepest level. How are you meeting your moment?

Thank you. I feel that every one of us here is a deeply brave, wonderful being. We're all brothers and sisters, every one of us. We just are.

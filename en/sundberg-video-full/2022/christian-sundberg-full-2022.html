for coming. Okay, so I have a 30-minute slot, so we're gonna dive right in. There are four topics I want to discuss today. First, I want to try to put some words to my pre-birth memory itself, just as context. Then, I'd like to talk about reasons we come to Earth, why we're doing this. Two, why the veil is important, and that is why we become veiled and do not remember the totality of who we really are while we're having a human experience, why that's important and necessary. And three, why love is so important. You know, when we hear all this about love, why is love so integral to this journey? What's the larger conceptual context for that?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so before I dive in, I just have to disclaim: these things are completely and totally beyond language. You know, we, when we're on Earth, we tend to believe that all of reality is like Earth. We learn the context of Earth, and then we have certain assumptions we buy into, and we think those assumptions must apply everywhere, like assumptions like linear time and discrete location, distance, even separation itself. Those are not fundamental properties that apply to all systems. So, it's very difficult to take human language and try to put it on these experiences. It just doesn't do it any justice at all.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Encountering a Guide and Choosing to Incarnate**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Encountering_a_Guide_and_Choosing_to_Incarnate**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Encountering a Guide and Choosing to Incarnate</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the speaker recalls meeting a highly evolved being, learning about the purpose of physical incarnation, and making the decision to experience human life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_speaker_recalls_meeting_a_highly_evolved_being,_learning_about_the_purpose_of_physical_incarnation,_and_making_the_decision_to_experience_human_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the speaker recalls meeting a highly evolved being, learning about the purpose of physical incarnation, and making the decision to experience human life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so long, long ago—and this seems so totally ancient to me, and yet it feels like it's happening right now—I came across this being who had been physical. This was before I had had any physical incarnations at all, actually. And I remember being completely overwhelmed by the beauty and the power of this being. His nature was so full of light and joy and power, and I felt it from him. And I asked him, "My goodness, like, what did you do to become this?" And this is telepathic; it's not words because, on that side, there's a sharing of information. There's just a sharing of the being of who one is, and you can feel what they feel, and they feel you, and it's a very complete and instantaneous sharing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I said, "My goodness, look what you've become. What could you possibly have done to be this?" And he shared with me that he had lived physical lives. And he shared with me, in specific, that one life he had suffered a long physical ailment, a pain or a sickness of some kind. I don't know exactly what it was, but an ailment that was very difficult for him every day. And the way that he chose to meet that experience allowed a—this is really hard to explain or describe—but a refinement of his nature. You know, who he really was was able to refine and grow through his integration of this experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I said, "I want to do that. I'm going to do that. I want to do that." I was really fired up and inspired. And he said something kind of along the lines of, "Yeah, that's what they all say. It's hard in a way you don't know." And I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do it."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then I remember reviewing with this guide what I can only describe as like my state, who I was, what I had been, what I had known. And it was very clear the thing that I needed to—I don't like the word "work on"—but the thing I needed to experience or do, the process. And the best way I can describe it in English is to say it was like a fear. It was a low-vibration perception that bested me in a previous experience and had led me into a place where I had become a very damaging person. And it was so dauntingly low vibration that even there I asked, "Is it even possible? Is it possible for any being to meet an experience of this low vibration, this much pain and fear, and integrate and heal it? Has it ever been done in all of creation?"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the guide showed, "Yes, it has been. And you have all time given to you. You don't have to do it all at once." And so, I knew from that point of view, like, if it can be done, I will do it. And that sounds kind of foreign to me here, you know, as a human, because it can be very daunting at times. But at that point, I just knew I could do it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, they brought me a life, a lifetime, a physical life that was appropriate for this intention of mine. And I reviewed that life, and I accepted it. And I knew that that life and all of the context that was involved in that life was extremely appropriate for my intention. You know, it was just a really good match.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Process of Entering the Physical World**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Process_of_Entering_the_Physical_World**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Process of Entering the Physical World</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the speaker explains the transition from pre-birth awareness into a physical body, the experience of losing their higher awareness, and the shock of incarnation." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_speaker_explains_the_transition_from_pre-birth_awareness_into_a_physical_body,_the_experience_of_losing_their_higher_awareness,_and_the_shock_of_incarnation."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the speaker explains the transition from pre-birth awareness into a physical body, the experience of losing their higher awareness, and the shock of incarnation.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, I remember going to this place where I needed to accept the veil. The veil is just a term, but it's just the word we use for the constraints that one must surrender to in order to have the physical experience from the fully immersed human vantage point. And I remember so, I remember having this veil come over me. And I like to describe it like if you have an amplifier that produces a sound pitch, and then you turn the knob down, and then you turn down some more, and then when it gets to the bottom, you turn down some more, more and more and more, keep turning it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's what it felt like in the body of my being to plummet down, down, down, down, down, down, down from this place of all connectedness and knowing. Like, I just knew all of myself, and I knew all that is, and I just knew I was connected to everything. To have that feel like it was being erased and obscured for me and feeling like I was plummeting down to this very dense location where it was like there was no heat and no air. It was just like a vacuum that was also dense. That's kind of what it felt like to be bodily.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Rejecting the First Attempt at Incarnation**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Rejecting_the_First_Attempt_at_Incarnation**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Rejecting the First Attempt at Incarnation</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the speaker recalls their initial fear upon incarnating, their attempt to return to the other side, and the realization of the consequences of that choice." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_speaker_recalls_their_initial_fear_upon_incarnating,_their_attempt_to_return_to_the_other_side,_and_the_realization_of_the_consequences_of_that_choice."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the speaker recalls their initial fear upon incarnating, their attempt to return to the other side, and the realization of the consequences of that choice.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, after I did that, I saw that I was in the womb as an unborn child. And I was only there for a short time, and I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this." Because I had so much fear rise up immediately because I felt like all of who I was had been cut off. And so, I was like, "I'm not doing this." And I summoned my strength, my might, and I fought my way out again. I pushed back past the veil, and I was able to do that. I successfully returned to the other side, but I became immediately aware that I had inadvertently killed the fetus. I killed the body that was to be mine. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I had a life review for that super, super short life. I don't know how long I was there, but it was super short. But I could see and feel and know how I had negatively impacted the mother, and not only the poor mother who was now in grief, but hundreds of other people, like ripples in a pond away from the mother. Hundreds of other people whose journeys were going to be made more difficult because of my fear. And I had all these great intentions, but I could see that I had only heaped difficulty on the journeys of these other beings who I so loved and respected.

Okay, so that life opportunity was wasted, but I still wanted to do this. So, they brought me this life, this current life that I'm in right now. And this life was not as perfectly—you know, not a perfect match like the other one was. It was still pretty good, though. It was good enough. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember reviewing what I can only describe as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold. It was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side, and it was thick at the trunk at the start, and then as you worked your way out, you got into the branches. It was kind of like that, except it was like what it would be to be me, to be Christian, the human, in all these possible avenues. And there were some that were very likely to occur and some that were much less likely. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it was both my decisions and the decisions of all the other players in the game, the free will choices of the people that were involved, all of us that would influence how it would actualize after I got here.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I was super excited, and I remember asking certain questions and requesting certain things. I remember saying, "Well, I'd like to be intelligent in this life again," because I knew that I had been intelligent in past experiences. And they said, "Yes, I could do that." And I remember knowing that it would be important that I'd be a male because, just, it's a certain quality of energy. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't mean to say males and females are different in this regard, but being a male has certain qualities to it that were helpful to me to meet this fear that I was coming to face. And I knew that the confidence my father would instill in me would strengthen me and give me a rock to stand on so I would be able to meet this fear. And I knew that it was very likely that when I was 22—or actually, I'm sorry, the age wasn't known—I knew it was in my early 20s, and it did happen when I was 22, that I would experience a trauma, and it would crush me and allow me to re-experience that fear.

Like, I was in the state that was like not, and it was like really important I go right now. And so, then the next thing, I was with these beings that I can only describe as technicians or tinkerers.

And this time, just basically choosing not to fight, just surrendering my control and letting the veil come over me and, like, hold on to me and allow it to work through me the way that it would and not fight it. And I did that. And so, then I was here in this very, very, very low-vibration state by comparison. I felt like I lost all of who I really was. I knew I was here, and I sent this one message back through this little tiny window—it seemed like a window, not really a window—back to the technicians, "Did it take?" And they sent one message back, "Yes." And I was like, excited that I had made it, you know, that I had successfully been veiled.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so then I was here for a while, and then after a while, I said, "You know what? I'm not doing this. This is so dark. This is so low vibration. I don't—I'm not myself. I am not doing this." So, once again, I began to muster my might to fight my way out. And as I did this, the most holy moment of my life happened where the great spirit of God came to me, or whatever word we want to use for it, the light, you know, the source came to me. And it showed me all of what I really am, the stars and the galaxies. And I felt the churning of our own sun in my being. I felt all the stars. I felt so much bliss and endless connectedness and love. And it said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm sorry, I just—it's so precious to me and very personal.

I was like, "Oh, well, that's still what I am. That's wonderful. That's beautiful." So, I relaxed into the simple existence of being in the womb. And the next memory I have is of being born and the shock and the trauma of physical trauma being born, but no intellectual understanding at all, no context at all.

And I want to get right into, since we're limited on time, and so I still want to leave some time for questions, you know, why we do this. I mean, and again, I can't put words on it all the way. It's far more than what anyone can say, and we all know deep down, but I'll just throw some ideas out there that I think can be very helpful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so what we are is integrators of experience. So, we are consciousness itself, spirit, and we grow, we evolve, we expand as we are able to have defined experience and know it, like really know it, and make loving choices through it, loving versus fear-based choices. So, when we integrate experience, we are participating in what we call, what we can call, the expansion of being. That is the growth and the refinement of what we really are, which is spirit, by going through a relatively high-contrast situation. So, the contrast of Earth, which is very high, it's a very dense system, very high contrast, an experience of uniquely very separate separateness, you know, while we're human. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That is actually a powerful tool, and it is a precious opportunity, actually, to come and be human and have this very high-contrast experience because, when we can do that, and when we can integrate that experience, and when we can make loving choices rather than fear-based choices in this context, that is when we can meet this life with authenticity and caring and compassion and kindness and selflessness and fearlessness rather than all the tools of the ego, all the stories, all the fear, all the judgment, all the ways we try to reclaim our power with ego. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If we can really do that, even in very small moments, it is the most breathtaking and powerful good thing. I can't even put words on it. It's not about big human accomplishment, even. It's about acting in love and growing in love in even the smallest ways because the Earth is kind of like a play stage, and these are just all props. And the props are going to go away. The play will pass because it's not fundamentally real. It's real; we're having a real experience, but it's also an illusion in the sense that it's not fundamentally real. It's like having a very super real dream. It will pass; we will wake up. And when we do, we get to retain who we really are. We really have been in that experience. That stays with us, even though the context may be very different.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, we come to personally know specific experiential vantage points and to express and experience our true loving nature within those contexts. And because Earth is super dense and highly constraining, it was a very high opportunity for growth, like ridiculously high opportunity for growth. So, to summarize all that, we are here to participate in the expansion of love and joy through personal evolution, which occurs through love-based rather than fear-based choice-making and through the integration of experience. That's at a very high level what we're doing. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that can mean really different things for different people. You know, everyone has different challenges, different contexts. We're all very unique. You know, humans may all look kind of the same on the surface, but the souls of we're all very unique. We have a very unique path, and so it can mean different things for different people and on different journeys.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, just four very quick metaphors for this, since this sounds kind of abstract. Number one: going. So, having a physical incarnation is like getting off the couch and going for a run. You know, you can stay on the couch all the time. It's nice and comfortable. You can watch TV, you can eat lots of good food, whatever. Why would you ever voluntarily leave the couch and go outside and put your body under stress and go for a run? Well, because it's an invigorating experience. You grow in strength, and you can experience new things. And then when you come back to the couch, it's comfortable even in a way that you didn't know before because you hadn't known anything other than the couch. You know what I mean?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Second, another exercise metaphor: it's like lifting weights on a weight bench. You know, why would you ever voluntarily lay down and push a heavy thing up? Like, why would you do that? Well, it's because it's a counter-pressure for you. And the contrast of Earth is a heck of a counter-pressure. All the circumstances, all the pains, all the biology, the limitations of biology, that's one heck of a counter-pressure.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A third metaphor: being human is like getting into a spacesuit and visiting an alien environment, a very constraining spacesuit so that you can go into this place that's not native to you. We're not natively separate. We have to come into this kind of experience if we want to know exactly what it's like to feel separate and to be separate. This is what we got to do.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And fourth, as I mentioned, it's like getting onto a roller coaster. Yeah, because once you get in and the bar lowers, you're in. While you're strapped in, you might not like it halfway through, but you're still in. And that is the very nature. You get the committed, and then you can't just easily exit if you'd like.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Importance of Forgetting and the Human Experience**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Importance_of_Forgetting_and_the_Human_Experience**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Importance of Forgetting and the Human Experience</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the speaker explains why the veil exists, how it allows for deep immersion in human life, and why remembering too much too soon could be disruptive." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_speaker_explains_why_the_veil_exists,_how_it_allows_for_deep_immersion_in_human_life,_and_why_remembering_too_much_too_soon_could_be_disruptive."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the speaker explains why the veil exists, how it allows for deep immersion in human life, and why remembering too much too soon could be disruptive.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so the veil. So, why is it important? Why is it necessary? It permits us to have this specialized experience of creaturehood and to have this particular and unique cognitive environment because, if you remember all the rest of who you really are and what you really are, you wouldn't be able to just be. You wouldn't be getting up and going to work in the morning and going to the bathroom and eating your cereal, you know, paying your bills. If you knew that you were, say, the sun, if you could feel the sun churning in you like I felt, you wouldn't be able to do these things because you'd be that. You wouldn't be you. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, if you want to be you—and as a human character, I mean, not the real you, they're not the true you, the human character—then you have to be able to focus deeply into it. And so, it limits our perception and our memory so that we can completely focus in it. And that is itself additive because, as we do that, it's like having a clean slate each time, even though we do carry certain things with us from experience to experience. We have this new personality now. Now we get to experience what it's like to be someone with just this background, just this human. And that is very helpful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And lastly, the veil prevents homesickness because, if you remembered all of what we really are, it can be very painful. So, it's protective in that way because that side is so high vibration, so loving, so free, so full of joy that we almost need to not be consciously thinking about that all the time if we want to have this type of experience.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Fundamental Nature of Love**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Fundamental_Nature_of_Love**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Fundamental Nature of Love</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the speaker explores the essence of love as the ultimate force in existence, how it contrasts with fear, and why it plays a central role in human experience." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_speaker_explores_the_essence_of_love_as_the_ultimate_force_in_existence,_how_it_contrasts_with_fear,_and_why_it_plays_a_central_role_in_human_experience."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the speaker explores the essence of love as the ultimate force in existence, how it contrasts with fear, and why it plays a central role in human experience.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so why is love the way that in all this? This is going to sound abstract, but this is, I think, really important. Okay, our true nature is unity and connectedness. We are all ultimately one. We are all a part of one ocean. And so, love is when we're acting in alignment, being in alignment with the unity that is true to who we are, whereas ego and fear arise from the illusion of separation. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Separation is not a fundamental state. It's not; it's an alien state. But we're afraid of it, and fear is what happens, what we experience when we have yet to evolve through this type of constraint. It's not even that the constraint is bad. When I say low vibration, I don't mean bad. I just mean highly constraining. We actually get to apply the meaning to our lives while we're here. But meanwhile, love is what we really are. It's the true power. Love is the only true power. Fear has no ultimate power. It only might have very temporary, short-term apparent power in the physical in some way. But the true power is love and freedom and joy and immortality and all the creativeness of our spirit. That is the true power. Fear is not powerful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, when we choose love, we are aligning ourselves even here, even in this very distant point. You know, we've gone so far vibrationally, we can actualize that love here and be that love here. There's this beautiful expansion of being that takes place, and we grow when that happens. Love is our ever-present true nature. That's what we are. And we are so loved that we are permitted to choose the experience of separation and to choose to experience not love for a while while we are here so that we may better know it forever.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, why choose love? That is what we are. It's what the true power is. It's the immortal, joyful freedom of what really is. And it is the joy of our nature. So, it's what we're here to do.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Addressing Common Questions About Life and Purpose**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Addressing_Common_Questions_About_Life_and_Purpose**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Addressing Common Questions About Life and Purpose</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the speaker answers questions about grief, reincarnation, soul groups, and the nature of existence beyond physical life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_speaker_answers_questions_about_grief,_reincarnation,_soul_groups,_and_the_nature_of_existence_beyond_physical_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the speaker answers questions about grief, reincarnation, soul groups, and the nature of existence beyond physical life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so before I stop talking, a few minutes for questions. Three quick reminders. Number one: you're not human. You're you. You're the beautiful you that is having the experience of being human today. And there's a big difference there. You might think you associate deeply with human content, but who you really are is the you that feels like you to you. Your consciousness itself is who you are, not human. Human is just something you're knowing or being for a while or wearing. It's a temporary experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, number two: you are loved. This is the most important message anyone can say to you, to remind you. You are deeply, deeply, personally loved, like loved so much that the universe is birthing love for you specifically. It's just—and I know that we feel so veiled to that while we're here, but I just hope that you can feel deep down in yourself somewhere that love because that is true. You really are loved. You really are that precious and powerful and important.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And three: there is nothing to fear ultimately. All of this experience is taking place within that larger context of love. So, we don't need to take the great challenges of our lives here so seriously. We don't actually need to be afraid. And I know that's not easy. I came to face fear. I felt a lot of fear. I was deeply traumatized in my 20s. I did a lot of healing, and I know, and I've been in pain, chronic pain. I know it's not easy, but ultimately, in the larger context of what is even more real than this, there's nothing to fear ever.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I'll stop so that we have a few minutes for questions because we have a pretty short time.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All right, well, thanks, Christian. We do have some questions. So, the first one is: another person has knowledge that she's a spirit having a human experience, but she still struggles with this even at age 57. Do you have any tips for her? And do we have a purpose? There's two questions. I'll start with the second one: yes, we absolutely do have a purpose. This entire play that we're engaged in is very meaningful indeed. It's not just some nihilistic thing that's happening in a corner of the creation. It's a very purposeful and beautiful creation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As for how to find it, that's a very like—to find one's true nature again, that's a super personal question. I also get lost again in the veiling and in the stories of the human character quite easily. But personally, I have found meditation to be very helpful. I mean, the answer to the question is very unique and personal, but I'm just throwing out meditation as one mention because, as we gain experiential familiarity with what we really are, which is awareness itself versus what we are not, which is our thoughts, that larger nature can rise up on its own because we've created space, not so deeply associated with the story now. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And while we're not so deeply associated with it, and there's that space, that peace and that love can rise up. And when that happens, it's beautiful, and we remember that's what we really always were.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, how does the experience of grief on Earth factor into our growth? What is the purpose of grief?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so love is our true nature, right? So, when we love someone deeply, and then they are absent from us, we experience grief because now we are experiencing what is perceived as the loss of that person, the loss of their presence. In fact, they cannot be lost. There's no such thing as separation. Those we love absolutely still exist, and we're connected to them right now. In fact, even just a loving thought is enough to bring them back to us in consciousness space, though we may not perceive it while we're human.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Grief, then, like so many aspects of contrast that we can experience on Earth, is an opportunity to experience some end. Yes, if we love and we have that connectedness in that relationship, what's it like to experience when we don't have that, when that seems to be missing? And if we can fully feel and know and process and heal that here, even to some small degree, that is actually an empowering thing because, then, when this is released, and we're back on the other side, and we see there's never a true loss, we cannot be separated. But now we know it better forever. We know more forever how precious it is to have those loving relationships.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, I'm generalizing when I make that comment because grief is different for every person, and it's, of course, specific to the relationship that is lost. But, in general, it is an opportunity to experience that contrast so that we better understand the true loving connection that we have forever. Absolutely.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, two more questions. Upon leaving this Earth plane, are we able to remember our true essence immediately and also all of our previous lifetimes on Earth and elsewhere?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so I can't speak to that categorically because each individual is unique. But, in general, I'll say that eventually, everyone will know who we really are because that is who we really are. And eventually, a given personality's journey must come back to the higher self. The higher self just means the you that's not obfuscated anymore. You are still you. You're always you. You're always your higher self. But to come back to full awareness of that, we always do reach that point eventually. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For some individuals, I think that's quite soon after physical passing. For others, I know that many individuals benefit from experiencing a very Earth-like experience for a while in a transitionary reality system, even until they're ready to take on the next step. But that's very personal, and it depends on the nature of the individual.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, did you meet with your soul group or choose your parents to help you decide to be born in this life?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, in my memory, I did not meet with an entire group, but I did choose my parents. I'm aware of my soul group to some extent intuitively, but I don't have active conscious memory of engaging with them. The parents were very important. I remember reviewing the qualities of them. I even had a sense of when they were meeting. And I knew they would be really good parents and that they would help me in really meaningful ways. So, yeah, I absolutely reviewed the parents. I knew both of them well before I was even in my mom's womb.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, great. There's one more question that came in. When you were in that pre-birth state, was it a blissful, heavenly area similar to what many NDEs describe?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, yeah. So, the state I was in before reviewing my next life path was what I would describe as a realm of golden light where I was perfectly free. And it's really hard to describe these things because we like to think in terms of earthly activities. There were activities that we could call creative in nature, and there's all sorts—we can't put one word on it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There's like consciousness activities, love activities, learning, but in a completely different context. But anyway, it was a blissful state of all connectedness and knowing and freedom, just total freedom, like unbelievable amounts of freedom where you can just—I use the word "frolic" before when I shared this experience, like frolicking. It's the closest English word I can think of to just moving happily through wherever you want, you know, just rejoicing who you are. I remember being in a state like that before agreeing to, you know, to come and have this adventure.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, unfortunately, we're out of time. There are more questions coming in, so would you mind if I put your website link into the chat box so people can get in contact with you if they'd like?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, of course.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, I'll do that. Well, we're out of time. Thank you, Christian. It was wonderful, and thank you for spending your time with us today at the conference.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you. I appreciate very much the opportunity. Thank everybody here for being human today.</p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">

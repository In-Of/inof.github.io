class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, good morning, Christian. It's really nice of you to take some time out to have a chat with me this morning for me and this evening for you.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, hello. My test, my mic. Is this better mic than the first one?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I didn't actually hear the first one. That's a very good mic, and I'm having mic envy.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, how about this microphone?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They're both fine. Everything's okay because this one is the better one.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, all right. Sorry, just kidding.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, thank you for taking the time. TED Talk sounds very interesting.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, it is an interesting thing for me to do because I don't speak openly about this kind of area of my belief system. I am going to be speaking to an audience on this. My alarm to wake up. I'm going to be speaking to an audience who are perhaps new to this kind of thing and opening their mind to the possibility that we are making choices well before we're born. So, hopefully, I actually feel inspired to share that because of some reading that I've done and exploration in that realm. I really think that it can make a difference to people's existence on this mortal plane if we approach life as if everything's been our own choice. That's really what I wanted to talk to you today about.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Discovering the Past**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Discovering_the_Past**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Discovering the Past</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian introduces his background, his rediscovery of pre-birth memories through meditation, his journey to sharing them, and the global resonance of his experiences amid a collective awakening." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_introduces_his_background,_his_rediscovery_of_pre-birth_memories_through_meditation,_his_journey_to_sharing_them,_and_the_global_resonance_of_his_experiences_amid_a_collective_awakening."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian introduces his background, his rediscovery of pre-birth memories through meditation, his journey to sharing them, and the global resonance of his experiences amid a collective awakening.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I'm very passionate about this topic.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, it is true. It is true that we choose it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, can we just go back to the beginning for the purposes of maybe orienting people who might listen to this? Would you be able to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your background?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, sure. So, my name is Christian, and my body is currently 42 years old in Erie, Pennsylvania, United States. So, a few years ago, I began to share about what's called pre-birth memory. That is, I have awareness of time that I existed before I incarnated into this life as Christian. That memory returned to me spontaneously 12 years ago when I took up a long-term meditation practice. It was not expected. It was just very normal when it arrived. When it came back to me, it was the most normal thing in the world. It was just like leaves had been blown off of the ground, and there it is. It's like, "Oh, yes, of course, I remember." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, not strange to me at all now, but up until the age of 30, I had no memory of it at all. Well, I should say that as a small child, I had some memory of existing before I was born up until maybe the age of five or six, and I assumed that everybody had that memory, but nobody else talked about it, so I didn't either. But then that memory left me completely. You know, as we become deeply associated with the forms of the physical and with our stories, it's quite natural for us to be veiled from that memory. That's the name of the game here. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I had no awareness of that at all until about 12 years ago, and then I didn't share it for maybe about eight years or so because, you know, I'm a working professional, and it's the kind of thing you don't really talk about if you want to be taken seriously. But I felt intuitively nudged that I really should share this, that the ground was fertile. This is about maybe four years ago now that I shared it, and I just felt like the ground was fertile, and it was time for me to share. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I did. When I first shared, I thought maybe five people will hear this or something, but no, it's become, it's taken on a life of its own, and I've been able to meet an incredible number of people from around the world who have similar experiences or some personal experiences they're trying to understand, and this has helped. In the process of that, I also wrote a book. I spent about six years or so slowly feeling. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, this book that I wrote is not one I ever sat down and just wrote. I felt that I was intuitively guided piece by piece to create this book called "A Walk in the Physical." My intention is to try to share what the human experience is within the larger context because there is a much bigger, very real spiritual context. We use the word "spiritual," but it's just the higher context that we exist within. I have felt called to share that in a way that is digestible, not in a way so much that is stimulating for the ego because, you know, we like lots of stories. I do share some stories, but I think it's more important to help remind each other what we really already know deep down, you know, underneath the stories of the human life, that which the deeper part of us already knows. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that's kind of my passion, sharing that message. Like I said, it's been met very well. I cannot believe the amount of people out there who resonate with the message and have similar pre-birth memories. I've probably met 30 or 40 other pre-birth experiencers now, and it's just awesome because here in this place, we're in such a unique vibrational place during the human experience. So, when we can meet here in this place and connect in this way, it's really awesome. It's a very powerful opportunity.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is interesting that in this sort of globally connected time, and probably more so because of the dreaded COVID, that people are having the opportunity to connect and find each other in ways that may never have happened in the past. So, I wonder if people with your knowledge have always walked with us on the earth or whether this is a relatively new thing because of the changes afoot that people are having these memories. What are your thoughts?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, I think no, I think it's there's always been people who have awareness of who we really are. I'm not special in any way. It's just that we come from a higher context, and we all know deep down about that context. It's just that we are in a, it's like Earth is like a simulation or a virtual reality, you could say, and it's just the nature of this virtual reality that we don't typically remember the larger portion of ourselves. That's just normal. But because our true nature is what it is, there's always people on Earth who are aware and who have shared that message. Right now, humanity is going through a process that is often called the awakening. It just means that there is a shift in consciousness occurring, and so it is becoming increasingly common for us to have awareness in this way and to share with each other. That's awesome. It allows us to change the world for the better.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Confronting Trauma**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Confronting_Trauma**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Confronting Trauma</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian recounts a traumatic medical event in China planned before birth to confront fear, detailing its physical and emotional toll and his healing process." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_recounts_a_traumatic_medical_event_in_China_planned_before_birth_to_confront_fear,_detailing_its_physical_and_emotional_toll_and_his_healing_process."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian recounts a traumatic medical event in China planned before birth to confront fear, detailing its physical and emotional toll and his healing process.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's good. I am curious about following that line, but I do have some questions that I need to ask. Of course, if we have time at the end, maybe we can come back to that. So, Christian, talk to us about your extremely difficult life experience that you've had.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so I won't recount my whole story for the sake of time, but I'll just say that I was aware in my pre-birth planning that I would very likely be completely crushed and traumatized in my 20s by a very difficult experience that would allow me to have the opportunity to re-engage a fear that had bested me in a previous experience. That is a fear that had overcome me, that I couldn't process, I couldn't talk, I couldn't integrate in the previous experience. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I knew that it would be very powerful if I could do that in this experience, if I could meet this fear and really process it, heal it, integrate it, and grow from it and not be overcome all the way. So, when I was 22, I had an experience that was very traumatizing for me. It was a medical event. On the surface, what happened on Earth was that I had a heat stroke in China. I was in a Chinese hospital for four days. I had bag after bag of potassium for four days. I was also weakened due to celiac disease. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, somehow, the collection of these circumstances was such that after this experience, during and after this experience, I was in incredible physical pain, neurological pain. I don't know how to describe it other than just saying it was an agony that just would not abate. It was just impossible to escape this pain. It was terrible. It was a hellish experience. I experienced trauma from it. I had post-traumatic stress for about six or seven years. In fact, during that period, I could barely even remember my lifetime up until that event. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">During that event, my mind blocked it off so completely that I could barely even remember my previous life before the age of 22 because this experience was so difficult for me. It wasn't just the pain. There was also a lot going on in my life at the time. Big life changes that I couldn't handle, familial life changes, graduating from college, financial things, everything all at the same time. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, then I went through EMDR therapy for a number of years to face and process and integrate this, to heal this trauma, this damage. It was only after that that I was able to then have this spiritual awakening journey that, like I said, began at the age of around 30. I took up a meditation practice. At first, I just continued meditating because I felt relief from the constant bombardment of thinking and associating with thought. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But then, after a few months of that, I began to have non-physical experiences, short at first but very eye-opening, that kind of kept me going down that path because I realized, wow, there really is a lot more going on. But I don't think that could have happened until I had really met and deeply processed this trauma. I no longer feel that I, I mean, I still have fear, of course, but I have done so much personal work to fully come to terms with and integrate this fear and this traumatic experience that arose from and through fear. Does that answer your question?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, can you tell me what you mean by integrate? How does one integrate fear, and what's the purpose of doing that in our lives?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Integration Explained**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Integration_Explained**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Integration Explained</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian defines integration as consciousness growing through experience, choosing love over fear, and explains its purpose in personal and collective evolution." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_defines_integration_as_consciousness_growing_through_experience,_choosing_love_over_fear,_and_explains_its_purpose_in_personal_and_collective_evolution."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian defines integration as consciousness growing through experience, choosing love over fear, and explains its purpose in personal and collective evolution.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, that's a big question because what we are is experienced integrators. We are consciousness that engages context, and we become something. From the perspective of this limited person with a very rich, detailed context, we make choices, and then results happen because of our choice-making. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, to put it at a more fundamental level, we wield intent. Intention is the primary action. It's not choice-making happens within a context, but the intent to choose something is that movement of consciousness to intend, which is our fundamental power. Being able to wield an intention that is more in alignment with love, which is reflective of our true nature, rather than fear, is the name of the game. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, really, what we're doing here is striving to actualize love, to meet our experience with love, and all the things love can mean. Love is not just one emotion or something. It's reflective of the unity of our being. You know, because at our base level, we are individuated, but we are also one. We're one with each other. So, love is reflective of the celebration of and support of all the things that it means to be one, to be unified, and how we interact with each other in that state. Here on Earth is where we experience the illusion of separation very deeply. We feel so separate, and when that happens, fear arises, and then we have to deal with that. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, love and fear are really the two. That's why so much spirituality is in discussion about these two ideas because really, it's what intention are we bringing to bear? An intention that is in alignment with love, or are we aligning ourselves with fear? That is the portion of us that is protesting and rising up against the limitations and the perceptions we've bought into about the limitations. You know, when we buy into a perception that is not in alignment with the truth, we suffer. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, for instance, if we believe this all relates to your original question, so I'll get back to it, but if we buy into the idea that I am unworthy of love, that's a big one on Earth, or if we buy into the idea that I have no power, I'm powerless, or I'm shameful, or I'm not free, you know, these are some of the key perceptions we buy into on Earth that are not in alignment with the actual truth of who we are. Who we truly are is totally free, totally loving, loved and loving, totally creative and powerful. That's what we are. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, when we bind a perception that is not that, that prompts us to experience fear, which means a rejection of and no way, I'm not okay with this response. So, what does integration have to do with all this? Okay, so integration is just the best word that I can think of, but the idea is that as we engage experience and truly grow towards love, past fear and towards love, we expand. That is, we grow in what we really are because consciousness is what we really are, and consciousness lasts. It lasts beyond any given context, including this context. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, when it can meet a certain context and be put under some constraints and then work out that context, and that means really assimilated, you know, really like what is it like to be you, like exactly you, in this place with this body, with these health challenges, with this circumstance set, with your family and your background and your history and the demands of your body and their finances and all the things. What do you do with that? You know, that ability of consciousness to meet that context and then operate through it, shine through it, make choices through it, it is so powerful because it allows a growth or a refinement or an evolution of beingness. This is really hard to talk about, but it's kind of like the main point for what we're doing on Earth. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I'll just bring up a metaphor because I think it can help. Okay, so if you're sitting on your couch watching television and you're super comfortable and you've got access to food and everything's comfortable and nice, why would you ever voluntarily get up off the couch and go for a run outside? Like, why would you put yourself through that stress? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, because when you do that, the stress of the run allows a growth in the strength of your body, and in such a way that when you get back to the couch, you're stronger, and not only that, you can even appreciate the couch in a new way. You know, because now you can relax and wow, this couch is nice and comfortable. The food even tastes better. You know, that kind of thing. It's just a metaphor, but what I mean is when we can subject ourselves to incredible limitation and then if we can choose love through that limitation and come to terms with our fear and overcome it, and overcoming fear is synonymous with the growth of love because fear is the real limiter, if we can do that, then we grow, and we help. Not only do we grow individually, but the collective grows. All in fact, all that is expands. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, in that way, being human is like fulfilling a, I don't know, the words are so limiting. That's one thing I just have to say every time I try to talk about this is that there is no language at all to discuss any of this. But we could say that it is a service to be human because we are helping to, hands-on, get down in the weeds in an extremely low vibration state of being by comparison and work through it. Working through it may be another way to say integrate. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Working through it so that our true nature of love can shine into it. And wherever we have fear is a sign that we have not yet fully integrated the experience, and that's okay because we are in a heck of a limiting experience right now. This is like a master-level class or something or climbing Mount Everest. You know, it's cold on Mount Everest. It's okay. There's not very much oxygen. Exactly. It's okay to acknowledge I can't breathe. I feel cold. Yes, that's the nature of being this limited. What do you do now? That's the key. It's not about being called unlimited fundamentally and in the end. It's about what you do, what you choose while you're in it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, very good. That answers my next question though, the idea of what's the purpose of this sort of experience, the hard experiences. But you would come across people, I imagine, who have had some pretty traumatic experiences, and what do you say to people who are more resistant to what it is that you're saying? You know, people who would say, "I wouldn't choose to be raped or to have my child murdered," or those kinds of things. What would you say to them?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, my. I totally would. I totally respect and honor that. First of all, I am not making light of the horrors of the world. I mean, I have personally experienced incredible pain. I certainly haven't even touched the iceberg of some of the potential horrors that can occur on Earth. However, it is the ego that rejects. The ego, which arises from fear, that is the case even if a great horror has arisen, and we reject it. And I reject things too still, of course. I'm still learning and growing like we all are, of course. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But there's always fear at the root if there is a rejection. If there is a judgment and saying, "No effing way," you know, whatever the explanation, "No way," that rejection always arises from some deep down fear because ego has arisen to protect the individual from this state, this context, which seems untenable. It seems unacceptable, and you know, just no, this is not okay. The moment we say that, we are in a sense turning ourselves against what reality has actually or how it is actually arisen. And rejection is a way of it's like a closing of the door, not a full opening, whereas love is fully open. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I don't know how else to comment on that because it's certainly not, it's not, it's one can't speak to it. But I can say that the love of what we are and the joy of what we are is deeper. It is deeper than the deepest pain, the deepest trauma, the deepest horror that can arise on Earth. The truth of our being, the love and the creativity and the power and the joy of our being is deeper. It's just we can't see it when we're wrapped within the pain, when we're wrapped within the perception and the story that hurts so much that, like I said, that perception that is not in alignment with that truth is with that we lose ourselves in that perception, and then we hurt. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We think about it, and then the thoughts hurt, and that's then that's who we are for that moment. That's, I mean, it's okay even that we do that because that's the nature of the human experience is to dive so deeply into these roles that we actually have to make hard choices. You know, like being on Earth is no joke. I mean, this is a no joke simulation, you could say, that is so deep that here we can experience even what it's like to not have power or to be physically harmed or to suffer loss that seems to never go away for a lifetime. You know, that's just the, but see, that is not a negative. It's actually a neutral context. It's just that the physical world is a neutral context that is extremely limiting. It's an extremely limiting context.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's like wearing a very, very heavy, like, I don't know, metal coat or something, and then seeing if you can get up and walk around, and then someone is really having a hard time with the coat, and they say, "What if they say the coat's heavy?" You have, "Yes, it's heavy." But you always have the power to choose what to do with it, like what meaning you put on it. You assign the meaning. Whoever you are listening, you have the power to assign the meaning to your circumstances. The circumstances are not intrinsically charged.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Embracing Fear**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Embracing_Fear**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Embracing Fear</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian offers practical steps to shift from fear to love by feeling emotions fully and owning one’s experiences, addressing resistance to this concept." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_offers_practical_steps_to_shift_from_fear_to_love_by_feeling_emotions_fully_and_owning_one’s_experiences,_addressing_resistance_to_this_concept."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian offers practical steps to shift from fear to love by feeling emotions fully and owning one’s experiences, addressing resistance to this concept.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">How would a person get from trapped in the fear and move towards the love? How do we make that transition?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that is an extremely personal question. Each person's because that is the person, that is the one of the main processes that we're here to do. And we are all very unique individuals. You know, as humans, we look kind of the same, but as spirits, we are incredibly unique beings. So, each being's walk will be unique. I'll at least always make a couple of comments. Okay, first of all, we need to be willing to feel. I was going to say accept because it's really about we need to be willing to accept and allow everything that is occurring. That doesn't mean that we don't intervene when necessary. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's not at all what I'm talking about at this moment. I'm talking about the state of being in which we meet the context. If we can totally allow and accept and not resist and not fight, our own feelings will rise up immediately to like the ego's protests will come right up, "No, I'm not okay with that," because this, I feel this, whatever is down there underneath all the layers of ego and all the pains and all the stories is asking for you to feel it and fully know it, fully face it. You know, like, it's what I'm trying to say is it's like when I experienced trauma after China, and I had hundreds of layers of covering from the root fear, I would find layer underneath layer underneath the layer over years of counseling of pain and a new negative self-perception, a new negative self-perception surely. Well, this one's really painful. Wow, that's got to be the root. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, I mean, it was like my ego had built 800 layers of story on top of this one primary horrible fear that I knew in the certain moment in this hospital in Chengdu, China, and I was so rejecting of that that I locked myself away in trauma. The way, in my own walk at least, I can only speak for myself, but in my own walk, the way to actually heal that was to go into it, not away, but to actually feel it when it arose, fully, fully, fully feel it and allow it. That allowing is like an opening of the door of what you are so that your being actually experiences it and lets it up and out and through. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And if you do that all the way, there is like it feels like it will destroy you maybe, but after the tornado picks you up and swings you around and smashes you against the ground a couple of times, it feels like you're going to die from feeling what's actually down there. You won't die. In fact, you're set free because the consciousness that you are is no longer tied within, bound within, locking something away in resistance. It's open. And when everything can flow, and that fear can be felt and processed, it becomes integrated. And as it becomes integrated, there is a natural expansion of the potentials of now what you can know and feel that you couldn't before. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, you don't go face it because you're trying to get rid of it. Like, you don't go, "Okay, I'm gonna heal this. I'm gonna go look in this dirty closet." You know, you honor yourself enough to actually feel what you feel and actually own your own crap all the way. That's a quality of intention. That's why I go back to intent. It's about the intention that you bring into that fear. So, I think that's the most succinct way I could say is a) feel, and b) what quality of intention are you bringing into the fear? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, the ego will spin great long stories. It's hard to find our way out of. I'm not making light of that, but if you are actually willing to feel and to own your own crap and, like, I mean, take responsibility for your own imperfect motivations and your own limitations and your own role in your own pain, if you're really willing to own that, you will be given opportunities because the deeper parts of you are working with what seems like, you know, you seem like you're not your deep report. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You are your deeper self. It's one being, but to the human personality, it may seem like things just are lifted up to be processed almost like they come from an external place. You just process them as they rise. You allow yourself to be willing to do that because your growth is success is the success of the whole thing. Like, the whole, all of spirit benefits when you succeed and actually growing. So, if you're really willing, you will be given opportunities. It just means that you are going to need to be willing to feel and to own, to own your own crap.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Understanding Ego**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Understanding_Ego**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Understanding Ego</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian defines ego as a fear-driven construct creating stories to cope with separation, distinguishing it from personality and exploring its illusions." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_defines_ego_as_a_fear-driven_construct_creating_stories_to_cope_with_separation,_distinguishing_it_from_personality_and_exploring_its_illusions."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian defines ego as a fear-driven construct creating stories to cope with separation, distinguishing it from personality and exploring its illusions.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian, can I just get a definition in your view of what ego is because it's laden with inference that's quite negative in our use of that term currently, but I think you might have used it interchangeably with the phrase human personality. Can you talk to that for a moment?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, no, yes. I don't mean to say that the human personality is ego. Now, ego though, so how I define ego is the portion of the self that has arisen in order to deal with fear and is birthed by fear. So, it's just the portion of the self that does whatever it can to fix this new big problem. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, now that we're separate, that's a big problem because now I don't have my power. I don't have the love. What's going on? I'm in a world of pain, and where I got to do these things to survive, and oh my gosh, the ego is the portion of the self that does it, grasps it, whatever it can to tell a story and to secure beliefs that will make the individual feel better. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, it's just the portion that is creating a story through beliefs and through self-identifications to try to fix the problem, I guess that's the best way I can. Whereas the human personality, the ego is just a term. It just means there's a portion of us that is acting in fear. So, as a simple example, when somebody is like, let's say they belong to a religious group, and they believe that by associating with this religious group, they are better than other people. Well, that's a very simple ego trick. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Look, now that you're a part of this group, and all I have to do is believe that this gives me value. See, oh, now that I believe it, your problem is solved. It seems the problem is not actually solved. It's a trick. It's an illusion, but we do that with so many things. Look, you have value when you have money. You have value, or look, you look attractive, so now you must have value, or you're lovable because this partner loves you, or you have freedom because whatever you can pick the brand that you like, you know, whatever it is that we're just grasping on to that constant seeking of next, next, next. That's when I'm just using as the ego.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, denying that we actually intrinsically have value anyway. It's not an actual act of denial. It's that we feel that we don't have value, and so we are frantically grabbing on whatever we can to try to find value. It has to do with naming, naming an illusion like naming a belief. Belief is not always egoic, but many times belief is at you going. You know, we're buying into things, and we're believing in them because it makes us feel better.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Meditation as a Tool**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Meditation_as_a_Tool**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Meditation as a Tool</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian recommends meditation to cultivate presence, sharing a simple focus exercise to transcend thought and connect with one’s true self." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_recommends_meditation_to_cultivate_presence,_sharing_a_simple_focus_exercise_to_transcend_thought_and_connect_with_one’s_true_self."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian recommends meditation to cultivate presence, sharing a simple focus exercise to transcend thought and connect with one’s true self.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A slight change of tack here. You mentioned meditation. Are there any particular meditations? Are there any other tools that you can suggest for people who are on the journey towards away from fear and towards love?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, okay. So, I share a meditation exercise in my book, which is available for free through my website in part four of the book. I don't know if I put a name on it, but it's a verb. It's like a version of transcendental meditation, and I list alternative types of focus that can be helpful. Meditation is very difficult to speak to because we like to label things. Meditation is a move away from the labels towards a full awareness of the present moment itself. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not thinking a new thought, though it may start as that because we think so much. We're so addicted to thinking that it's okay if meditation begins as establishing a new thought to focus on for a while and just that thought. That's okay, but ultimately, meditation is not about thinking thoughts. It's about a use of one's intent to focus on the present moment fully and to fully be alert, totally alert, without the need to label or think, to just be fully aware. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, there are different exercises that can lead one in that direction. I recommend a very simple exercise actually that still works for me. I recommend like setting aside time, maybe 40 minutes a day sounds like a lot, or you could take less time, but set aside a named amount of time and give yourself permission in that time to sit down, close your eyes, and only focus on a neutral object that you imagine in your mind. If you can visually imagine something, I like to pick like a shape like a square or a triangle and simply draw in your mind the shape and put your full attention on it, not just your thinking mind, but like your whole bodily alert present attention on drawing the shape. Thoughts will arise, especially when you start. What am I going to have for lunch? Or man, I really got to do this thing next week, or I have a pain in my knee, you know, whatever. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's okay. That's totally fine. That's normal. Just keep going back. Go back to it, and you basically you're giving yourself permission to not care about those important thoughts for now, just for these 20 minutes or 40 minutes or whatever it is. Give yourself total permission to not attend to whatever the thought is saying is so important and instead to focus completely on this very neutral thing. Now, the reason this is meaningful is because what you're doing is training your, you're using your intention to train your focus to what you choose rather than being lost in constant thoughts that we dream through all day. You know, like when you think all day, there's only some awareness there. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The rest of us is stuck thinking, thinking, thinking. Whereas if we focus and we learn to be able to focus on what we choose without interruption, it opens a space. I like to use the metaphor. It's like standing in a river that's like the water's hitting you like thoughts just keep coming. Meditation is not stopping the water. You can't stop thoughts. Meditation is about standing still in the water, and it's kind of like in a whirlpool in a pool when you go around in circles, you know, and you're making water momentum, and you suddenly stop. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The water is going to hit you really a lot at first, but if you just stand there, it'll start slowing down because you're standing still. And so, the practice of meditation is very important and helpful and powerful because over time as you do that, the thought momentum slows such that you will have times when the deeper parts of what you are can arise all on their own. Like, what I mean is as you grow an awareness of what you really are, experiential awareness of awareness versus thoughts and labels, so you're no longer turning to ideas and thinking, you learn to fully feel the aliveness of your awareness itself. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And as you do that, like I said, the deeper parts of you will rise up all on their own, and there may be experiences that occur not because you're trying to go and get them necessarily, but because you truly do transcend the physical when you're not so deeply lost in all the thinking about it. The peace and the joy of who we really are can rise up, and even just one moment of really tasting that is worth all the time and all that effort or whatever. It's not ultimately effortful. I'm just saying it seems when you start like you get to put forward an effort.

I have a really important question, which is pretty much the purpose of us having this conversation today, and I really want to know what the impact of knowing that you chose this experience has been on you being able to deal with, integrate, cope with the trauma of being in this physical life.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, first of all, it's incredibly freeing to have no fear of death. I mean, I'm afraid of the dying process, but I have no fear of the end of the physical life. In fact, I'm very much looking forward to it. I don't mean that in a negative way. I'm just very excited. So, that is a big one because a lot of us are running from the idea of our own end. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, when we know that there is truly no end, then life becomes an opportunity. It becomes just like a playground because you do get to use it as a playground. So, that is the first thing. The second thing is we come to find that the awareness that we are is deeper than the pains and limitations that confront us in life. So, and that is a big part of integrating this vibration, this place, is knowing it within who we truly are in a way that we are fully experiencing it and yet not overcome by it. There is an incredible freedom that can take place within one's consciousness as one knows what one truly is and feels that aliveness even as Earth is happening. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that can be very, very freeing. I'm on this path. I'm certainly no master, but I feel that I have been released from so many old fears and beliefs that I thought were so real that aren't. So many limitations that I thought defined me that don't truly. They're just an experience that I'm experiencing now. I do find in my own case that it also can be difficult in a way because we live in a world that is not very much aware. So, the average vibration, shall we say, is quite low at times. The average level of awareness is not as high as it could be. So, it can be painful to live in a world that is so full of ego and distraction when that is not, that's just so much of it's unnecessary. And also, it can hurt to remember even a small piece of home. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's one of the things that the veil does for us is it prevents us from homesickness because it's very difficult to remain focused into this great limitation when we have some awareness of the incredible freedom and joy and total bliss of what we really are. It makes one miss that and yearn for it in a painful way. But yeah, but overall, it's incredibly freeing to have that awareness, and then as we do that, we're able to, like, as we, if we know who we really are, we're able to live more representation of that. You know, what we really are as free beings of love. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, we can better be that in whatever context, in whatever small way, if we know it. And that sounds so simple like a wordplay or something, but no, that is the very nature of what we're doing on Earth is to try to actualize that love, to try to actually like meet this place and love each other and participate in creation in a deep, real, creative, authentic way. And so, when we have some sense of who we really are, we're much more able to do that, and we're much more able to then give permission to others to do that. And it doesn't even have to be that we perform some action that other people see. We're actually all connected energetically. Like, the collective consciousness of humanity is like one big pond or something. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, when you awake and you process your fears and you bring love into your life even in the smallest way, you know, basically when you choose joy, you are giving permission to all the rest of the collective to choose joy too, even those that you can't see. And that is an incredible effect.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, Christian, I've followed your journey, so I'm pretty okay with the story, your story, and you've talked about making the choices of this life that you're in and seeing the tendrils of choice when you were in between lives, if you like, and like an if-then kind of way of looking at the world. So, please talk to us about the fact that not only have you made a choice about this life and the experiences that you've had, but the fact that we still have some agency while we go along, and it's our fate's not necessarily sealed.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Free Will in Action**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Free_Will_in_Action**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Free Will in Action</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian discusses pre-birth planning as a probabilistic framework, emphasizing free will’s role in shaping life’s path through intention and choice." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_discusses_pre-birth_planning_as_a_probabilistic_framework,_emphasizing_free_will’s_role_in_shaping_life’s_path_through_intention_and_choice."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian discusses pre-birth planning as a probabilistic framework, emphasizing free will’s role in shaping life’s path through intention and choice.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Absolutely. Yeah, so in my pre-life plan, I reviewed what I can only describe as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold. Like, if you laid a tree on its side and started at the trunk and went out to the branches, and I was aware of this. This is very hard to describe, but basically, what it would be like to be me, to be Christian, and to go through these paths. And I could, so there were, how do I describe this, probabilities associated with the paths. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Some paths were very likely, and some paths were much less likely, and what would make the path occur or not was my own free will choice-making and also the choice-making of every other player in the game. So, the intention, like I said, to bring down even deeper, the intention that I would wield and the intention that every other person would wield would affect how this might actualize. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, you might think of it like a predictive technology or something like at the beginning of the life, spirit is extremely good at predicting outcome, but it's probabilistic. It's not deterministic. It's not an objective reality. It's a probable, it's an apparently objective reality. It looks objective when we're here, but it's a probabilistic reality that is nudged constantly not only by the actual actions we take but by each and every intention. Each intention that we wield inside of our own minds is actually nudging how the physical actualizes all the time, and we're all doing it whether we know it or not. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Some people call that manifestation. You know, that it's just that our consciousness is constantly pushing on the physical. And then once, so, what we're signing up for is a constraint set and a context, and the context will have certain limitations. You know, the body has certain limitations. The circumstances of your family have certain societal limitations, financial limitations, whatever. You know, the full context. You sign up for the context, but then once you're here, you get to make all the choices about how you're going to use that context, what meaning you're going to put on that context, which choices you're going to make. Are you going to make choices out of love or fear? And that free will ability always remains. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, while there is a very clear pre-birth understanding or prediction, I don't really like the word prediction, but we'll use the word prediction, like a pre-birth prediction is seen, there's always free will. There's always free will agency to choose what we will as we go down these paths, and we're completely free to choose whatever we like. Like, it's not like you're totally locked into, you know, nothing is a hundred point zero zero percent. I mean, there's certain things that are extremely likely, you know, but you always have free will to choose what you're going to do with that, and there's a lot more power in that free will than we typically recognize.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Excellent. So, I wonder, and again, I'm following threads here rather than set questions, I'm wondering how much access you have to, I guess, the greater consciousness and the concept of why. So, you've addressed the why we're here on Earth, but there must be a greater why. What is the purpose of all this ultimately?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Evolution of Love**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Evolution_of_Love**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Evolution of Love</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian explores life’s ultimate purpose as the expansion of love and joy, concluding with wisdom to embrace one’s true, fearless self beyond human limits." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_explores_life’s_ultimate_purpose_as_the_expansion_of_love_and_joy,_concluding_with_wisdom_to_embrace_one’s_true,_fearless_self_beyond_human_limits."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian explores life’s ultimate purpose as the expansion of love and joy, concluding with wisdom to embrace one’s true, fearless self beyond human limits.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The evolution of love and joy is all is its own why because love and joy are wonderful. So, to participate in the evolution of love, to participate in the expansion of what one is and what all it is is wonderful, and that is a constant process. The process of evolution, spiritual evolution, doesn't ever truly end. I mean, we're constantly growing and refining because that is the nature of all it is. It constantly grows and evolves, and that is a beautiful process. I don't know if that speaks your question, but that's the most succinct way I can think to speak to it. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, in my pre-birth experience, I remember coming across a being who had been physical before I had even been physical and feeling the incredible joy and love and power that this being knew and had and was like the quality of his essence was so incredible. And so, you know, what, so why do that? You know, why put ourselves through such incredible constraints to do that? Because we choose. It sounds so simple, but it, you could say because of curiosity even. I mean, it sounds maybe not sufficient, but nothing is actually required of consciousness, of spirit, but we choose to participate in ever and ever greater refinement of being, ever and ever greater evolution for the expansion of love and joy.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian, with all of this knowledge that you have, this understanding of the life experience and why we're here, is there any final wisdoms you would like to share?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I think it's really important, whoever you are listening, to remember that you're not actually human. What you are is you. The you that feels like you to you is who you are. Now, you may think that that you that feels like you to you is exactly your name, your body, your job, your limitations. It's not. You're wearing the context for now, and so while you're wearing that, it is so important to be reminded there's nothing to fear. We absolutely, in the ultimate sense, never have anything to truly fear, never ever ever.</p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">

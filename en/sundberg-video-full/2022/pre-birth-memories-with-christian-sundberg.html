I'm Emmy Vadnais, co-host with Jeffrey Mishlove. Our topic today is pre-birth memories. My guest is Christian Sundberg, who, when he was a young child, remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While that memory completely left him, it spontaneously returned to him at the age of 30 through meditation practice. Christian is the author of <em>A Walk in the Physical</em>, understanding the human experience within the larger spiritual context. Christian is based in western Pennsylvania, and now I'll switch over to the internet video.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Welcome, Christian. It's such a pleasure to have you with us today.<br>
Thank you so much. I'm happy to be here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Most people don't recall any experiences before coming to Earth, or some people even... A lot of people wonder why they're here, yet you have had an experience of recalling your pre-birth memories.<br>
Yes. I can share about that if you'd like. Let me just state before I do here, though, that this is not something that can be expressed with language. Our true natures are so fully transcendent to the form of Earth that as soon as we put words on it, we are immediately limiting it in a way that is often inappropriate. I'm very happy to share what I can, but I just have to make that very important disclaimer that there are no words that can possibly articulate our higher natures or the nature of the higher realms.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I had no pre-birth memory for the majority of my adult life. I did have some of that recollection as a very small child up until about maybe the age of five or six or so, and then that memory left me completely. It didn't return until I was the age of 30. I took up a long-term meditation practice, and the memory spontaneously returned starting after several months of meditation unexpectedly, but it was the most normal thing in the world when it returned. It was like leaves had just been blown off of the ground, and there was the grass. It was just like, oh, no big deal. There it is, very normal, but it has very much impacted my life and my path because I have some personal awareness about what I'm doing here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I have a passion for trying to share with others some aspect of what we really are because we are not just human. I know it looks like we're human. We're doing a human thing. I'm a working professional in my daily life. I know how this sounds, but actually, deep down, the nature of what we are transcends the human condition. It transcends the human experience. We are individuals. We're spirits who are having an experience of being human. That's a really important message to keep in mind because we take our lives on Earth so seriously. We get so deeply wrapped up in all the concerns and all the stresses and all the fears and all the stories, but who we are vastly transcends the stories.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are beings of incredible freedom and love and power and joy. That is what we really are. We lose sight of that because we're veiled while we're human. We become obscure to the true knowing of who we are on a conscious human level, but that's a part of the game. We do that in order to have this experience. That's just a little prep, just a very high-level comment. I just need to say that first before I dive in. Would you want me to just dive in and share some of the memories that I've had?<br>
Yeah, we would love to hear.  </p></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Early Pre-Birth Encounters**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Early_Pre-Birth_Encounters**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Early Pre-Birth Encounters</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian recounts a pre-birth memory of meeting a spiritually evolved being who had been physical, inspiring him with its refined essence and joy to pursue incarnation for personal growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_recounts_a_pre-birth_memory_of_meeting_a_spiritually_evolved_being_who_had_been_physical,_inspiring_him_with_its_refined_essence_and_joy_to_pursue_incarnation_for_personal_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian recounts a pre-birth memory of meeting a spiritually evolved being who had been physical, inspiring him with its refined essence and joy to pursue incarnation for personal growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The timing of this is difficult to articulate because we transcend linear time. While these memories are incredibly ancient and they also do have a sequence, they also are all happening right now. They're like living a live experience, not just memory like we experience it in the human way. That being said, I remember long ago before I was ever physical, actually, before I had any physical incarnations, coming across a being who had been physical. When I came across this being, I could feel and know from him telepathically because there it's all an exchange of information. There's no language necessary, no spoken language.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I could feel the quality of his nature and his essence. It was so overwhelmingly beautiful and full of power and love and just capability and expansiveness that it was breathtaking. I could feel this amazing joy and power. I said, "My goodness, do you feel the depth of joy and power and freedom that I feel that you feel?" He shared yes, and he allowed me in to feel what he experiences.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was completely awestruck. I was inspired. I was like, "I'm going to do that. What did you do to do that? I want to do whatever that is." He said he had been physical. He shared with me many things. Chief among them was that he had lived physical lives, and in one of them, he had suffered some kind of ailment, some kind of disease or something. I don't know exactly what it was, but it was very painful, and it lasted for a number of years. The way that he chose to meet that very challenging experience allowed a refinement of the quality of his essence, his nature, who he was refined.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I really don't know what words to use, but he just expanded and refined in a way that was very, very tangible from that state of being. I said, "I want to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that." I was so deeply inspired. At first, he said something to the effect of, "Yeah, that's what they all say. It's difficult in a way that you don't know." Not brushing me off, but kind of like, "No, you don't understand. You don't know what this..." But I was persistent, and I said, "No, I mean it. I want to do that." He said, "We'll go talk to your guides."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't have immediately right after that, but I know that I lived many experiences after that. I came back later and found this being again and shared with him that I was in the process, and he was encouraging when I shared with him.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Reluctance and Preparation for Incarnation**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Reluctance_and_Preparation_for_Incarnation**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Reluctance and Preparation for Incarnation</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian describes his reluctance to reincarnate, his guide’s persistence, and a review of his soul’s qualities, highlighting a fear he needed to address from a past life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_describes_his_reluctance_to_reincarnate,_his_guide’s_persistence,_and_a_review_of_his_soul’s_qualities,_highlighting_a_fear_he_needed_to_address_from_a_past_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian describes his reluctance to reincarnate, his guide’s persistence, and a review of his soul’s qualities, highlighting a fear he needed to address from a past life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The majority, though, of my pre-birth memory experiences of a time somewhat immediately preceding this life, I remember taking a long break after previous experiences and just being reluctant for a while to return into the rigors of the game. It was like taking a very long weekend of being reluctant to go back, something like that. I remember this guide coming to me over and over again and saying, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" Putting them off and just saying, "No, I'm not ready yet. No, I'm not ready yet." Eventually saying, "Okay, I'm ready."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Then reviewing with this guide what I can only describe as my state, like who I am, who I have been, who I was, what qualities I really knew and expressed. The words are so limiting here. I really don't want to pigeonhole it. It's very hard to describe, but it's kind of like just evaluating who I am and what I knew and what I understood and what I had experienced and mastered and what I had not.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was very apparent to me the thing that I needed to work on. I don't like the words "work on." It's not like that. There was this very obvious thing. I had this fear that had bested me in a previous experience. It had overcome me. In that previous experience, I was a very unhelpful, unkind person in that life because of this fear. My ego got out of control, and I caused a lot of damage to other people. When I say damage, by the way, I don't mean true damage because the soul cannot truly be damaged. There's no true damage, but I knew that in that life, I had been very unkind and unhelpful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This fear was just so deep. I could feel it and see it, and I'm like, "Oh my gosh, I got to do something about that." I knew, though, that if I could, there would be this incredible expansion of being, not just in me, not just of me, but of the whole. I don't know how to describe this, but this incredible expansion of what was possible, a refinement and an evolution of capability if I could know and meet and integrate this low-vibration fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I could see even from there how very extreme this fear was, like what a low-vibration energy it was. I asked, "Is it even possible in all of creation? Has anyone ever, has any being ever done this? Has any being ever integrated something this extreme in this way?" I was shown, "Yes, and you have all of time available to you to do so." That was what was expressed, so there's no hurry. I just knew that if it was possible, I'll do it. I will do it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">From the human perspective now, having experienced this life, it seems so strange to me at times to say that because I do experience great challenge at times, of course, like we all do. But from that perspective, I knew the incredible power of the soul. I knew that we have nothing to fear and that nothing can truly overcome us. We are incredibly powerful and expansive and free and full of joy and love, and that cannot be overcome.

That life was extremely appropriate. It was a great match for my quality, like who I am, and also for the intention of processing this fear. I reviewed this life in detail, and I accepted it. When I say this life, it's not this current life as Christian. This was just before this experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I reviewed and accepted the life, and then I accepted the veil. This is the part of my memory I remember the most clearly, is this process of accepting the veil and the vibrational place that we are at now in relation to that higher state through the veil. I don't know how to describe this, but it's like a plummet in the vibration of the being such that all knowing is cut off.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I describe it like if you have an amplifier that produces a pitch, and then you turn the knob down, and then when you get to the ball and you turn it down some more, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower more, lower, lower more, now lower, now crank it down lower some more, that was what it felt like. It was just an incredible drop in the vibration of my being. And I felt all of what I am like disappear, be cut off, be kind of like being erased.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Very hard to describe the sensation, but it was like going from a place of high vibration connectedness and knowing to feeling separate and dark and dense and alone and not having access to my knowing anymore. And it was terribly dark, and within seconds of getting there, I was like, "I am not doing this. There is no way I'm gonna tolerate this for a lifetime. This is not happening."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I summoned my might, my strength, and I fought my way out past the veil. And I was successful in doing that, but I became aware that I had killed the fetus that was to be my body. I had caused a miscarriage for the mother. And just like a near-death experience just described, I had a life review. Even though I was only there for like, I don't know, a super short time. I don't know how long, but a very short amount of time.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I could see very clearly how my fear had negatively impacted the mother by heaping grief upon her shoulders. And not only the mother, but hundreds of other people like in ripples away from the mother, I could see and feel how they were all, all their journeys were made more difficult because of my fear. I was like, and so from that perspective, you know, it's okay. Everything's okay. It's just, you know, it's just like a big play. Everything, everyone is okay, but I also very objectively could see, "Oh man, I got to work on this because I, you know, I had all these big plans. I wanted to have such a positive impact. I wanted to grow and participate in this amazing human game, and the opportunity to be given a human life was so precious, but I had wasted it."  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Accepting the Current Life**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Accepting_the_Current_Life**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Accepting the Current Life</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian resolves to try again, reviews a less ideal life plan with specific requests like being male and retaining some memory, and prepares for incarnation with tailored conditions." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_resolves_to_try_again,_reviews_a_less_ideal_life_plan_with_specific_requests_like_being_male_and_retaining_some_memory,_and_prepares_for_incarnation_with_tailored_conditions."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian resolves to try again, reviews a less ideal life plan with specific requests like being male and retaining some memory, and prepares for incarnation with tailored conditions.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so I, I kind of resolved, "Okay, I got to, I got to do something about this. This is, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try again." So they brought me now this life to review. And this life was not as appropriate as the first one would have been. I mean, I want, I'm not gonna put numbers on it, but it just wasn't quite as appropriate as the first, like the match. It was okay. It was good enough, but it wasn't like super, super appropriate because my spirit, my soul has certain qualities in the life of certain contexts, qualities, the biology, the parents, the context, everything. It's all, there's a certain fit that, that there, you know, there's a certain level of in, of a match or not.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And in this case, it was, it was good, you know, it was okay. And I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail. It was as if somebody like, this is just a metaphor, but this is how, kind of how it visually, I saw it visually and I felt it within me. It was like, if you took a tree and laid it on its side and you started at the trunk and then worked your way out to the branches, I could see millions and millions of possibilities of how this life may unfold. What was very likely, what was less likely, it was like, like a probability tree, I guess you could say.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the only, and the thing that was unknown was the free will choice making, you know, of all the participants. But it's put, it's pretty darn good at predicting outcome. So I could see that certain at, like certain branches were very likely, and I could see that it was very likely that I would suffer a trauma in my early 20s, and that that trauma would crush me and give me the opportunity to re-experience this fear. And so I was very excited. Like, you know, from, from this perspective, it seems, I guess we might even consider like, it's not masochistic, okay, but I can see how some people might say, "Oh my gosh, I would never, I would never sign up for that."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But from that perspective, I was very excited at having the opportunity to be challenged in this way and to be able to have the opportunity to meet this fear. And I made certain requests for the life. You know, for instance, I knew that it would be important that I would be male in this life, just because the male energy would be helpful for me to have a certain type of personality that would help me to deal with this fear. And I also knew that the qualities of my parents were important. I knew my father would instill confidence in me, and that it was really important that I had that confidence so that I would have a rock to stand on when the fear hit.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I would, I would be strong enough in my own self to be able to weather it and have a chance to, you know, to really face and process it. And I asked certain things like, I asked to be intelligent again in this life. I knew that I had been intelligent in previous experiences, and they said, "Yes, you can do that." And I asked to remember a very small amount this time. I said, "I would like to not forget everything this time. Like, I'm just, I don't want to forget everything. I just want this tiny, tiny little sliver of memory, please. Can I do that?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And they shared, "Yes, you can do that." But I could feel from them that this is really hard to describe, but the contrast between there and here would be even greater. And so the life would be even more difficult if I did that. But see, I knew that even that contrast, like all contrast, was and is an opportunity for growth. So I accepted. I was like, "All right, let's do it."  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Veiling Process and Arrival**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Veiling_Process_and_Arrival**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Veiling Process and Arrival</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian describes the veiling process, his surrender to it after practice, a divine reassurance of his eternal nature, and his curious entry into human life at birth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_describes_the_veiling_process,_his_surrender_to_it_after_practice,_a_divine_reassurance_of_his_eternal_nature,_and_his_curious_entry_into_human_life_at_birth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian describes the veiling process, his surrender to it after practice, a divine reassurance of his eternal nature, and his curious entry into human life at birth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so I remember there having to be this moment to say, "Yes," and I'd like to accept the package, so to speak. I don't remember that moment, but I do remember being in like this waiting area where there was this golden light, this beautiful light. And I remember this guide coming to me all of a sudden like, "Go now," like grabbing my attention, like grabbing me by the shoulders very forcefully, like shake me and push me into, it was like I had to interject into Earth time or something.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I had to go right now, like not later, right now. And then I found myself in this, what I can only describe as like a tinkerer's shop, or a technician's shop, where there were these beings who are very mechanical in nature. It's very hard to describe. And they do this thing where they fit the veil to you. So like the soul has certain qualities, rich, rich qualities, like its own universe of qualities, and the human life and the biology and the context and all everything has a certain quality to it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And they do this thing where they like, they make it all fit so that the veil will be very effective and be worn properly. And they asked me one last time, "Are you sure? You know, because," and I knew that once I said yes, here I was in, I was in for the ride. It was like, you know, once you get into this roller coaster, you're not getting off till it comes to a complete stop, that kind of thing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I said yes. And then I remember the veil coming over me, and this time, just struggling not to fight it. And one thing I hadn't mentioned is in between these two lives, I spent some time practicing surrendering my control to the veil in like a simulating environment, like a simulator. And so I just resisted, I just did not resist the veil. You know, I like, I surrendered and allowed this down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more, lower, more, lower, more.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Plummet in my vibration and this knowing that I had be erased and be cut off. And once again, I was in the dark and alone and feeling super dense. It's like arriving to a place where there's just no heat, like arriving to the vacuum of space is a good metaphor, I think, like you just, you get there and you can't breathe, it's cold, there's nothing, it's empty and yet dense, so dense.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember sending one message back to the technicians, "Did it take, you know, did the veil take, like did I succeed in arriving?" And they sent one message back, "Yes." And I felt actually the sense of accomplishment because it was like, "Oh, I made it," like even just making it into a human life was a huge accomplishment.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Then I was there for a while. And eventually, that same fear that I had the previous time arose once again. And I was like, "I am not gonna do this. This is so dark, this is so low vibration, this is so dense. I am not doing, there's no way I'm gonna tolerate this, I'm not having it." So once again, I began to summon my might and my strength to fight my way out.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when I did this, the most holy moment of my entire human journey happened. I felt the presence of what we can only describe as God. I mean, this is certainly beyond any word, like a human word like God, but it was the great I am of all that is. God is the closest word I know that came to me, and it expanded me back out. And I felt all of the universe within me, and I felt all the stars and all the galaxies, and I felt the churning bliss of our Sun.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the, and this great presence said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And it was incredibly comforting. Oh my gosh, it's not what I'm, I'm so glad I didn't, I did not, I didn't lose everything like I thought I had lost all that I am. That's how it felt to be veiled. But that message was so comforting. I'm like, "Oh, then I don't need to fight, you know," and I let go and settled into the simple existence of being in the womb.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the next memory I have is of the day I was born. I remember the shock of being born, this the sensory experience, all this cold and shock and light and touching and sound. And I remember I had no idea what was going on, like none. So bewildered and curious. I remember looking up at the nurses and just being like, "Who are these beings who are taking care of me?" And being so curious.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it's funny, because when I shared this with my father, you know, he said to me, "You were looking around with the most curious, intense stare I've ever seen." So I remember, I remember that intense curiosity. So yeah, so that's just a quick summary of the experience. I know that, you know, that sounds like a lot. I feel like it's just the very tip of the iceberg.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm still very much veiled. And I'm thankful that I am. And I certainly can't speak for anybody else, but I can at least say, you know, that anyone who's listening today, we are not, we're not human. You know, we are that spirit of life and love that is so much bigger than this human experience. And we get so lost in this story. You know, we go down our life journeys and we just get totally wrapped up in all the stories and stresses and fears.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I know I'm not making light of it. But that is not what we really are. And whoever you are listening today, I just want to remind you, you are a being of love and joy and freedom. That's who you are. And you're very brave to come here into this amazing, awesome, you know, simulation to have this experience of being physical and light. You don't need to take life so seriously. You know, this can be an experience of joy and playfulness. And we can do whatever we want with it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, so anyway, I just, I just have to share that. And I'm not saying it's easy for me either. I deal with many challenges like many of us do. But there is, there is great hope in the actual truth, you know, because this thing is not like, this is not just like a religious, like, you know, belief for me. This is, this is, it's what we are. And deep down, we all know it somewhere. Underneath all the layering, underneath all the veiling, we know we are more than human.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are something that we feel maybe when we're looking at nature or when we express ourselves creatively or when someone really tells us they love us, you know, we have glimmers of it. That substance of joy and love and freedom is what we are. What an incredible experience.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Nature of Spiritual Beings and Interactions**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Nature_of_Spiritual_Beings_and_Interactions**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Nature of Spiritual Beings and Interactions</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian explains the non-physical essence of spirit beings he encountered, their telepathic interactions, and the vast, thought-responsive nature of afterlife realities." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_explains_the_non-physical_essence_of_spirit_beings_he_encountered,_their_telepathic_interactions,_and_the_vast,_thought-responsive_nature_of_afterlife_realities."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian explains the non-physical essence of spirit beings he encountered, their telepathic interactions, and the vast, thought-responsive nature of afterlife realities.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And in those moments of interacting with other spirit beings, could you describe them a little bit more for us? How many did you encounter? You mentioned that some of them had specific roles. We'd love to hear a little bit more description if you're willing to share.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sure. So the question is already laden with Earth assumption because we tend to think about reality as being primarily comprised of discrete objects and places that we can see and touch. And while we do experience realities and other environments in other reality systems beyond Earth, that's that we definitely most certainly do. In fact, they're even more real there than they are here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That is not the true real nature of what we are. You know, consciousness transcends form and gives rise to form. So I can share a few forms, you know, because that's what we know. But that's not really what's fundamentally important. Beingness itself is alive, and that living beingness can share itself and interact in ways that are even far beyond human comprehension.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'll say that in my pre-birth experience interacting with the guide, there were times when I experienced this guide non-visually, but I knew he was present and communicating with me telepathically. There were moments I experienced a visual interaction where I was in a realm of gold, and it was, this is very hard to describe, but he was perceived as a being of light. That's the closest metaphor we have is light. But it's not about like, you know, shape or anything like that. It's about what's actually happening.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I know that may not sound connected, but like really what we're all experiencing is what we're like, how it actually feels to experience this moment. That's really what's happening is our actual experience. And so in those systems, our actual experience is what is being directly engaged, and that's more true than an Earth environment where there's like a number of objects.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As for numbers, like the time that I saw the golden being long ago, we were with a large group of probably at least hundreds of other beings that were moving across this landscape. I can only describe it like the landscape of light, and he and I and all these beings were doing one shared activity, though he was far more evolved than I. In this way that I described, we were all still participating in the same activity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't know what that activity was, but I could perceive, you know, the other individuals there in that environment. So, I mean, I guess that's, I guess it's all saying, you know, that's not super specific, but like I don't try to get too much into the specificity. I mean, I've had out-of-body experiences where I've perceived others, you know, once again there, it's not really about like a visual perception.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like one time I had an out-of-body experience where I engaged the, I know this sounds crazy too, but I engaged the soul of my wife's ex-boyfriend, and I was, I shared with him, and I was able to feel deeply into him who he is, who he was, and I perceived it as a vibration that was like a universe of color and sound and feeling, and I was a part of him, and he's a part of me even though he's his own being too, and I could feel how we overlapped.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, like how do you describe that? You know, like what does that look like? Well, look like, I mean, the closest thing I could say is if you imagine a galaxy of thousands of colors, you know, maybe something like that, but it wasn't primarily about a visual experience. So, it depends on the experience, and it depends on how relevant, you know, that kind of data is.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and I'm not necessarily looking just for visual, I was just curious your general experience. Okay. But I think a lot of people are curious because they don't remember like you do. Yeah, so, well one thing I'll say is that the afterlife is certainly not just one place. I mean, goodness gracious, no, it's incredibly vast. I mean, if you think about how many places are there on Earth, you know, and Earth is just the tiniest, tiniest, tiniest, tiniest fragment of our universe, and our universe is just the tiniest fragment of a much bigger multi-dimensional picture.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And other realities have incredibly less limiting rules than ours. So, boy, I mean, the variety of experiences that are possible, you know, it's beyond, it's beyond comprehension, it's beyond what we can even possibly name. I don't try to map anything like that. I mean, sometimes I have out-of-body experiences or, you know, other types of experiences. I'm just, I just kind of leave myself open, and I know the thinking mind likes to, "Oh, let's put labels on it," and there are others that are far more experienced in those types of adventures than I am.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I try, I don't try to put a model on like specifically other kinds of realities from here. I don't really feel like from the human vantage point that we're very good at doing that. I can at least say there's a vibrational geography. So, what you are vibrating at, and that means the state of being that you're in, is locational. That's, like, that's the simplest way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And most realities are thought-responsive reality systems in which our intention, our thoughts, our beliefs, our expectations have an immediate effect on the environment. It's true on Earth, too. It's just much, much slower. Earth is just super, super dense.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Do you recall connecting with, for example, a soul group or are there groups of souls who tend to incarnate together?<br>
Yeah, I don't have memory of interacting specifically in that tangible way with my soul group. But I do, I am aware that I'm a part of a group, and I've had at least some interaction while physical, briefly. But most of it is internal, telepathic, not like a full-out-of-body experience.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Purpose of the Veil**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Purpose_of_the_Veil**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Purpose of the Veil</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian elaborates on the veil’s purpose in creating separation for a unique human experience, its effect on memory, and its role in soul expansion through contrast." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_elaborates_on_the_veil’s_purpose_in_creating_separation_for_a_unique_human_experience,_its_effect_on_memory,_and_its_role_in_soul_expansion_through_contrast."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian elaborates on the veil’s purpose in creating separation for a unique human experience, its effect on memory, and its role in soul expansion through contrast.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Could you share a little bit more about the veil and why we experience it and why many people frequently don't recall their pre-birth memories?<br>
Yeah, sure. So, the veil is very purposeful. You know, we wouldn't be able to have the experience of being this deep into the experience of separation, into being a separate being if you weren't veiled. Like, if you want to be the human, you got to be the human, man. You know, you got to be veiled to all of what, the totality of what you are and just focus on the human experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, the veil is very effective at that. So, we wake up every day. We typically don't remember much about, you know, maybe we have some dreams or something, but we usually don't remember any non-physical experiences we've had while we're asleep. We just go right into our day. We get our breakfast. We go to work. You know, whatever. That, the fidelity of that super consistent experience is enabled by the fact that we are veiled.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Veiling is just a, it's like a, it's like wearing a cloak of limitation on your consciousness. So, your consciousness pre-exists. And I know it feels like the consciousness is like shoved inside of some kind of real body or something. No, actually, the body is more like a context and more like a constraint set that consciousness wears. But consciousness is still first.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, there are states of being in which you can become aware that the body actually is occurring within you. Like, you can actually feel it very tangibly. Rather than it feeling like, you know, most people, I think, experience like as if you're inside the body looking out of your eyeballs, you know. That's just the surface layer. The veiling enables that surface layer.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the more we focus on that layer, so the more we focus on the sensory experience and our thoughts about the sensory experience, all of our thoughts and labels that we put on it. So, sight, sound, touch, hearing, taste, all that good stuff. And then we interpret and we buy into stories. And then we, then we set this thought momentum into motion. And we start thinking the same thoughts, and we wear these pathways into our conscious experience and actually into our neurology as well for these thoughts that we continually think.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then we just keep experiencing them. And the more we focus on that, the deeper the veiling is experienced. But kids, on the other hand, you know, they've come in, and they're not super deeply associated with the story yet. So, it's much easier for them to step back and, you know, come and go to the non-physical or to feel closer vibrationally, you know, to who they really are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, why is all that necessary? Because, oh my goodness, this is a really important, broad and complex topic, but I'll just say very generally speaking at a high level, the contrast of this level of separation enables an incredible opportunity for expansion through the integration of experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, we are able to come very deeply into actually experiencing being separate here. And that experience of separation is actually quite alien. It's not native to who we really are. But if we can come all the way here, it allows perspectives that are not otherwise possible and then the integration of experience from and through those perspectives.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And being human is incredibly unique and incredibly valuable. It offers such very, very unique, extreme, well-defined cognitive experiences and physical experiences that are not otherwise possible. And that is very valuable to the soul. You might say that we as souls are experienced integrators, you know, and this is one hack of an opportunity to have experience and to learn and grow through it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And by the way, when I say learn, I don't mean intellectual learning. I mean a growth of the being by being something, by integrating the experience of being something. And that growth of the being, we can say, is the expansion of love and joy. It is the processing. So, when we integrate experience, that means processing fear as well.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And as we process fear and as we really come to terms with these experiences and really know them and know exactly what it's like to, you know, to be you in this place, we participate in the expansion of creation and the expansion of love and joy. Because love and joy is our true nature. Now, you could say that that's like the substance of what we are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so when that substance is able to be exposed to or committed into great contrast, there is this refinement and growth and expansion of that love and joy through that experience. And so the veiling is as additive in that it allows that experience.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Meditation and Reconnecting to the Self**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Meditation_and_Reconnecting_to_the_Self**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Meditation and Reconnecting to the Self</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian discusses how meditation, driven by intent rather than technique, helped him recover memories and fosters presence, love, and release from ego-driven fears." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_discusses_how_meditation,_driven_by_intent_rather_than_technique,_helped_him_recover_memories_and_fosters_presence,_love,_and_release_from_ego-driven_fears."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian discusses how meditation, driven by intent rather than technique, helped him recover memories and fosters presence, love, and release from ego-driven fears.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There may be those listening who wish that they could recall as much as you are. And it sounds like you were able to have these memories come back spontaneously through meditation. What kinds of meditation did you engage in that helped you with your memories?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Right. So, the human likes to think, "What action can I get what result out of?" You know, that's how we do things on Earth. So, I'm saying that in context of your question because I don't particularly feel that the name of the meditation or the process of the meditation is the active ingredient. Though there are some meditation forms that work better for some rather than others.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For me, I followed a meditation offered by Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer in his book. I think it's chapter 23. There's an aside in there. It's basically transcendental meditation. But like I said, I don't think the name is very important. What is important is using your intent, taking time, we're in linear time right now, taking time to use your intent to choose what to focus on, to start with something neutral in your mind and control.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Control is probably a bad word. Choose to use your intent to focus on just something that you choose and stand still in the water. You know, like the river of thoughts that hit us all the time. It's like a river just keeps hitting us in the face. Meditation is taking time to stand still in the water, and you don't judge yourself whether you're doing it or not.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, you just use this time to focus on something neutral, and eventually, when you're able to control your focus so that you can focus on what you choose and not be lost in the dreams of thoughts, you bring your attention fully into just the present moment for all that it is and into the aliveness of your own consciousness, the aliveness of your own body.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Experience it deeply in this present moment for exactly what it is. You don't put any stories on it. You don't need any labels. You don't need any judgments. You just dwell fully in the knowing and feeling of that aliveness. Now, that may seem to the human personality who's used to doing things as unproductive, maybe, or you know, like what is that accomplishing?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, you don't go into it to accomplish something. You don't go into it with expectation. But what happens, though, is that as you become in touch with, consciously in touch with that aliveness that you are, deeper parts of yourself will bubble up, rise up, all on their own. Not because you're going and trying to accomplish something, but because you are almost inadvertently releasing your grasp, your death grip on the forms.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You're releasing your death grip on thoughts and on stories and on sensations and all these things that keep us so deeply veiled. And as you do that, you will find that, yes, we're veiled, but we are never not on the other side of the veil, too. We're there right now. Like, the consciousness that you are extends past this human experience right now. It's already there.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, sometimes then, through meditation, knowing of that, personal experiential knowing of that can rise up on its own. I understand what you're saying about meditation. While you're unique in having these pre-birth memories, there are various types of meditations which can help a person do exactly as you described, to be able to experience themselves and not have the thoughts whirling around and to be more in the present moment.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And as you say, to also then be able to be a more loving, compassionate person. Yes, yes, exactly. Yeah, loving, compassion is like of the substance of what we are. It's what we are. So like, but the thing is, we all have fear. So fear means ego rises up to desperately try to save us and protect us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And oh, no, no, no, I'm a little, for instance, I'm afraid I don't have power. I have no power. Look at this world. I have no money. I have no, I can't control anything. Ego rises up. Oh, no, you have power because look, you have, you have money or look, you're physically strong or look, you have value because you belong to this organization or you have this certain belief, whatever it is.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I bring that up in the context of your question because, you know, when we look inward, at first it may not be obvious, but most of us have very many layers of ego going on. That's okay. It just means there's fear. And as we really come to terms with what our thoughts are, how we're using our thoughts and the quality of the intention behind those thoughts, that that's always the key is the quality of our intention is, is our intention in this moment based in love or fear and ego.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And in so many cases, we have to be humble enough to find, oh, my goodness, I have so much fear. I have so many layers of ego rising up. Anyway, so I think I went down a bit of a tangent, but I just thought that was meaningful in the context of your question because that's one of the reasons it's so valuable is when we release the ego stories, we can face and process the fear and we find that love is always what we are and what we have then, always.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Purpose&nbsp;of Experiencing&nbsp;Fear" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Purpose&nbsp;of_Experiencing&nbsp;Fear"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Purpose&nbsp;of Experiencing&nbsp;Fear</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the&nbsp;purpose of experiencing&nbsp;fear in&nbsp;the human experience&nbsp;is explored,&nbsp;emphasizing&nbsp;that fear represents&nbsp;unevolvedness and the opportunity to confront and integrate limitations.&nbsp;The text discusses how fear arises from the contrast&nbsp;and depth of limitation in human life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the&nbsp;purpose_of_experiencing&nbsp;fear_in&nbsp;the_human_experience&nbsp;is_explored,&nbsp;emphasizing&nbsp;that_fear_represents&nbsp;unevolvedness_and_the_opportunity_to_confront_and_integrate_limitations.&nbsp;The_text_discusses_how_fear_arises_from_the_contrast&nbsp;and_depth_of_limitation_in_human_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the&nbsp;purpose of experiencing&nbsp;fear in&nbsp;the human experience&nbsp;is explored,&nbsp;emphasizing&nbsp;that fear represents&nbsp;unevolvedness and the opportunity to confront and integrate limitations.&nbsp;The text discusses how fear arises from the contrast&nbsp;and depth of limitation in human life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Since what we are is love and joy, is there a purpose for us to experience fear? The way I use the word fear is not just another emotion. Fear just means yet unevolvedness. It just means there's some extremity of contrast that we have not yet come to terms with and we have rejected in some way. Something's too big for us to handle.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the human experience is full of opportunity for that. I mean, like I said, I experienced fear as soon as I became veiled, and that fear just means I really have not fully come to terms with this depth of limitation. And being human is an extreme amount of limitation, an extreme amount. I can't stress that enough.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's like going and climbing Mount Everest and then saying, "It's cold." Yeah, it's cold. Mount Everest is cold. Yes, there's low oxygen on Mount Everest. It's hard to breathe up here. It's okay that it's cold. The question is, what do you do now that you're here? How do you respond to Mount Everest? How do you respond to the cold, to the low oxygen? What do you do with it?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">See, it's not about the context. The context itself is, I mean, it's a real experience. The human experience is a real experience. But it's also an illusion. The context is an illusion. The forms are not fundamentally real. They're being used and created in, they're like tools. The whole system, the whole system of form, the whole simulation is like a tool that has been created to facilitate the expansion of consciousness, the expansion of being this through the integration of experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So the question is not what exactly is happening in your context. The question is, how are you responding? What are you responding? What is the quality with which you are responding to this moment, to this thought, to the story, to the circumstance that just arose today? What is the quality of the intention with which you meet it?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Are you looking right at it and really trying to process it? Are you owning? Are you trying to be open and bring love and compassion? Are you resisting fear and new ego stories to try to cover up what's really going on? You know, you have a free choice to do either one.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Transcending Form" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Transcending_Form"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Transcending Form</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the concept of transcending form is discussed, emphasizing that consciousness is the fundamental reality that transcends physical and non-physical forms.

Well, form could be any form, whether it be a physical form or certain non-physical forms. A form is something that has distinction and is this and not that. If it's a tomato and not a piece of corn, it's a form.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We think reality is form, and we think there's this shared objective reality out there and that's the ultimate reality of this matter. No. No. Consciousness is knowing this apparently shared reality of objective matter. It's like a simulation, a very, very good simulation. What we really are transcends form.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, we often mistake, when someone says that, I think some people often mistake that to mean, oh, there's nothing really real there then. No, no, no. The realness of the life that we are is so rich and so full of everything, of life and joy and possibilities. It's wonderful. So when I say that we transcend form, that doesn't mean nothing is real or nothing matters.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No. We create and use form and express form because of the creative and loving and joyful nature of life. So when you look at a sunset, is reality ultimately that yellow and orange? Not at the fundamental level, but through the yellow and orange.

You've had this pre-birth memory and you're very enriched from it, but they're listening and thinking, well, how am I to, you know, really go forward when things are so hard for me? What can you say to those folks?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so first of all, I am definitely not special in any way. That absolutely has to be said. First, I feel like it's natural for people to say, oh, this person is special now. No. No. I'm just another traveler on the weeds like everybody else getting stuck in the woods. We are all dealing with the limitations and the constraints and the pains of the human condition.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm certainly not immune to that either. And also, like I said, it's actually very painful having some memory because the contrast between there and here is great, and I'm very thankful that I am not like I'm very thankful that I am still veiled and I do not have more awareness. I know that sounds backwards, but I feel like it's helpful for me to, you know, be able to have the capacity to really do my best to meet this experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so but meanwhile, it's not a matter of, you know, having some great blessing to have this knowledge on a conscious level. Like to me, there's not a big distinction between those of us who have some awareness of that and those who don't because we all are that. We all are the being that transcends the physical.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I don't, like everybody around, everybody here is, has bravely agreed to participate in an experience of great limitation and veiling. And that was an incredible service. And we're all performing that amazing service. So, so there's not really a distinction.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so I think the latter part of your question was so how to help those people? Is that what you asked? Like how can they be helped? So, I recommend, okay, so in my book, <em>A Walk in the Physical</em>, I do try to, the book is about trying to point the reader towards the portion of themselves that already exist beyond the physical right now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And by the way, the book is available for free online. It's not about money. If you go to my website, awalkinthephysical.com, the book page, the third link down, the whole book is available there for anybody to read. I want to encourage anyone and everyone that, you know, that wishes to consider the possibilities that you really are more than human.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And as you consider those possibilities and as you spend time exploring, so meditation is a great exercise, a great long-term habit to get into. As you really commit time and energy into that, you find out for yourself. And as you find out the truth of your own being for yourself, there is always incredible relief and joy in that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because joy, like I keep, like I'm beating a dead horse here, but joy and freedom is our true nature. So, you know, so finding that again is everyone's birthright. And for everyone, that process will be unique. That's why I'm not being too specific about my comment, because we are all very, very unique beings.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We're each like a universe unto ourselves. We all have a unique relationship with the divine, or whatever word we want to use, the higher context of spirit. We all have a unique path to walk. So each individual sense for themselves, what is the best way to, you know, to nurture that and to go in that direction.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In general, I recommend meditation. I also recommend that, you know, we spend time in mindfulness, being aware of exactly what's happening, try to become aware of, in our waking, you know, daily activities, what meaning we're putting upon our situation. Spirituality is not about searching for some far-off land, you know, some other reality that's not this.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, spiritual, spirit is here. This is deeply spiritual, this moment. So meeting this moment with fullness of presence and with fullness of awareness has so much potential. And so I, in general, encourage that, because if we do that deeply enough, we find that there is always peace and joy.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it's our own stories and our own resistance to the context that makes it so painful. You know, like usually when someone is saying, oh, that's not fair. You know, I wish I remembered. I don't begrudge anyone who says that I know how difficult this is, but, you know, ego, ego protests. That's what ego does.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We protest because we have fear, because we have not come to terms with the grotesqueries and the limitations of this experience. We need to, well, not need to. It is helpful if we can meet even those great difficulties with love and not resist, not place our own judgment on the world.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Try to really meet and heal the portion of our own lives that is not peace. You know, if you meet even one thought with more openness and personal responsibility and love and feeling like being willing to feel the feelings that are underneath it, you know, that quality of intention and even one thought, it helps the whole world.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it certainly helps you as an individual, you know, to move towards that freedom that is who you really are. It's not a picture of hopelessness. We all have incredible power every day and every moment in how we meet this reality. So that's kind of some high-level comments. You know, it's different for each individual, but just some high-level thoughts.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Wellspring of Love" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Wellspring_of_Love"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Wellspring of Love</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the concept of love as a wellspring is explored, highlighting that openness and vulnerability allow for a deeper experience of love.

Yes. You know, it's funny because so often, because of ego, we close ourselves off to everything, because we don't want pain. We don't want the negative. We don't want the limitation. It's been so hard for us to process.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So we won't even let ourselves feel love fully, right? But love is open. It's so open. It's so fully accepting. It's fully feeling. It's spacious. So when we allow ourselves to actually be vulnerable enough to feel love and love the person next to us, love whatever, to feel what we're feeling in this moment and love reality by looking at the sunset, that vulnerability is, I think of the word I use in the book actually, is a wide road to love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because it's like in that vulnerability, that openness, you're dropping the ego stories. You're dropping the fear. You're allowing yourself to move vibrationally, instantaneously closer to who you really are, you know, that rich aliveness of love. So when we practice giving love and when we allow ourselves to feel love, yes, we will feel more love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's a wellspring. There's so much love at the root of all things, even though we're many, many layers deep into separation and deep into the stories that seem so real, even though we've come all the way out here, we cannot change the truth of the very root of being, which is love without fear. That is the very root at all times and in all circumstances. It's beautiful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And love can continue to expand? Yes, always. Yes, spirit, consciousness is always in the process of expanding and evolving more, you know, ever-growing, ever, like an endless symphony of love. I don't know what words to use, and it never ceases to grow in joyful freedom and expression and love and creativity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now I know you're not into too many definitions and putting too much form to things, but for our listeners, I'm just curious, how would you describe what love is? Our true nature is one. We are all connected to one another. We are all drops in the one ocean metaphorically. Love is the natural knowing and recognition of that truth, that you are part of me and I'm a part of you and the whole world is a part of me and I'm a part of the whole world.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And love is the way that we express that. It means putting the other ahead of yourself in many instances, most instances. It means the expression of joy in the other. It means the celebration of what is and the celebration of the others. It means all that, you know, I can't possibly put an exhaustive definition on love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Love is just like the word life or spirit. You cannot possibly define it, but I think it's worthwhile though to note that the reason it is what it is is because unity is our true nature and love is reflective of the truth of unity, whereas fear is reflective of the illusion of separation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, when we feel separated and all of a sudden, oh my gosh, now there's a big problem. I don't feel connected to the whole anymore. I don't have my power. I don't even know I'm going to live past death. I don't even know how I'm going to pay my bills tomorrow. What the heck's going on?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, that that state of fear, that's not native to us because we're not, our true nature cannot be harmed. Our true nature cannot not have what it needs. You know, our true nature is always connected and free and full of love and joy. It's only when we bind to perceptions that are not in alignment with that truth that we experience fear and that we suffer.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is the place to try to do that. This is the place where, wow, wait, I'm actually going to get to be separate and buy into perceptions of powerlessness. You know what I mean? This is the place where you get to do that, you know, and then see what we do with it.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Overcoming Self-Doubt and Limitation**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Overcoming_Self-Doubt_and_Limitation**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Overcoming Self-Doubt and Limitation</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian addresses self-doubt and guilt, affirming everyone’s preciousness and framing limitations as opportunities to strengthen love when met with compassion." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_addresses_self-doubt_and_guilt,_affirming_everyone’s_preciousness_and_framing_limitations_as_opportunities_to_strengthen_love_when_met_with_compassion."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian addresses self-doubt and guilt, affirming everyone’s preciousness and framing limitations as opportunities to strengthen love when met with compassion.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, but the truth is that unity of being and love is an expression of that unity of being. For those who are listening who may be feeling kind of down on themselves or maybe they are feeling some guilt or shame for something that they may have done and are having a hard time loving or even liking themselves and therefore it makes it difficult for them to like and love others. What might you suggest?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh my goodness. Okay, I know this sounds generic and I don't know exactly who you are listening, but whoever you are, you really are unbelievably precious and important. And if you knew the value of who you are, the profound preciousness of you, like, like if you feel deep down in you, like underneath all the crap and all the trauma, can you feel the preciousness that you are?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That is priceless, and I don't know what word to describe to all that is. And you are a precious irreplaceable portion of all that is. You are just so incredibly meaningful. And I'm saying that in the context of your question because then what we do, okay, so that's who we are. That sounds nice. I don't feel that right now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's because when we're here, we buy into stories of some identity that is not in alignment with the truth of who we are. You know, usually when we're kids, our parents condition us in some way or society conditions us in some way. You know, you're only valuable if you, you know, go do this thing or accomplish this thing or believe this thing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, that's that's where your value is derived, and with enough rehearsal and, you know, that playing this over and over again, then we buy into that identity. You know, but that's not our true identity. Okay, it's a temporary experience of a character that we are engrossed in.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So keep that in mind, please. If you feel lack of worthiness, if you feel, you know, low and unimportant, that is not the truth. That is somehow, there's some story, maybe many, many years in your past in this human lifetime, you know, that has been, that has been, you know, conditioned into you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Or maybe even there is a fear that you've come to experience in this life. Maybe there's a, maybe, you know, I can't, certainly can't speak for everybody. We come for many different reasons, but perhaps some individuals are here experiencing what it's like to have a perception of being worthless.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because in actually knowing that and coming to terms with it, we then forever know what it's like to have that, like infinite value, like, like, but in knowing worthlessness, we can know true value. So, so basically, try to sense how you are the experiencer of the story and of these conditions that you've bought into, rather than just the story and just the conditions and just the smallness that the world seems to prove to you every day, you know, that's not truly who you are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah. It makes me think about maybe we can all recall ourselves as young babies deserving of love and care. Exactly. You mentioned that health is our natural way of being. And for those who might be experiencing mental or physical health conditions, you say that we return to health after this lifetime.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Right. Well, we return to health whether in this lifetime or, you know, we're after this lifetime, wholeness of being is what we really are. So, we will return there. And the physical expression of us, the physical body with which we are so deeply associated right now, is also always trying to work back towards that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, constantly churning with the power of life, trying to, you know, get back to homeostasis. But regardless of whether, you know, whatever state the body is in here in the physical, the nature of beingness, the nature of life with a capital L is full of vibrance and health.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, one way or the other, we will return there. And I'll just also make one other brief comment. And I don't, I don't have a lot of specific memory to this. But I do know that after, because when I met this being who had been so deeply damaged by this pain that he experienced for years, I asked him, "Were you healed?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, because I could feel how he was damaged. Like as a human, he was damaged, man. You know, like he, he really, I mean, his true nature wasn't, but he really was a damaged person. And I think so many of us can relate to that. But when we return to the other side, all of that is healed.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it becomes like, okay, imagine if you dig a pit in the ground, a hole, and that's the damage that you're enduring. Now that there's a hole in the ground, now after the life is over, that hole can be filled. Like now you've made a space into which the love and the light and the healing and the fullness of being can fill and rejuvenate.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that's beautiful. And then you, and then you keep that. I'm not saying that damage is good. I'm not, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that as we encounter the extremities of this world of contrast, including health challenges, you know, or psychological, you know, damage, whatever, whatever the forms of limitation that have seemed to overcome us or wound us in some way, that can be and will be fully healed.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then subsequent to that, we then know that like that's available to us. Like, oh, I know I, I now have experiential knowing of this depth of limitation. It's been healed. And now I know this, I know what this means. And that was something that I experienced from this being who I came across. He had been healed, and it was an incredible depth of healing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I'll just say also that in my own journey, I have dealt with many health challenges as a part of what I'm here to experience. And also I dealt with post-traumatic stress at my 20s after this fear invoking experience. So I've dealt both with physical and psychological, you know, challenges to a great depth.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I am not making light of it. I am not making light of the horrors, the absolute horrors that can potentially occur in the human experience. I am not making light of it, but I can say that life is deeper. Like, your consciousness is deeper than the deepest crap, you know, that seems to be plaguing you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You are actually deeper than that. It's just now what do you do with it now that you seem to be overcome by this physical limitation or psychological limitation? Now what do you do with it? Because there's so much actual opportunity in that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So basically, see the limitation as an opportunity. It'd be kind of like if, let's say you're laying on a weight bench and you're lifting 100 pounds over you and you're like, "Man, this is heavy." Well, now you got a choice. What are you going to do? You might as well lift the weight and use it for its intended purpose.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And all I mean by that is the limitations of your life, the challenges of your life are actually opportunities to see how you will respond to them and choosing to respond to them in whatever way is aligned with love. And that will mean different things for different people, like I said.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But whatever that loving way is rather than fearful way, if you do that, you are using that limitation in the way that it was meant to be used. You're lifting the weight, so to speak. It's like maybe love muscle or something. You're strengthening your love muscle by meeting this experience with love rather than fear in any moment.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Doesn't matter what it is. Our limitations can help strengthen us. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. We sign up for, some of us sign up for very extreme limitations because we see the extreme potential in them.  </p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="**Encouragement and Collective Healing**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Encouragement_and_Collective_Healing**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Encouragement and Collective Healing</strong></h3><div class="heading-children"></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Where Christian encourages joyful living, sees value in religious forms when used lovingly, and emphasizes individual power to heal the collective through acts of love." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_encourages_joyful_living,_sees_value_in_religious_forms_when_used_lovingly,_and_emphasizes_individual_power_to_heal_the_collective_through_acts_of_love."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian encourages joyful living, sees value in religious forms when used lovingly, and emphasizes individual power to heal the collective through acts of love.</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What is your relationship to the worldly religions and what some people refer to as God? Well, I personally still enjoy practicing world of religion in a certain way. I certainly don't feel it's necessary for me, but I still attend church with my family and an open-minded congregation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Historically, I've spoken at a unity church somewhat routinely, so I participate there. But basically, so we're beings of form right now. We like form. We need form. Form helps us. There is value in form. Whatever form is appealing to you to pursue the divine and to seek an actual growth of your being in love and to be guided, then that can be useful to you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not the form itself that has the active ingredient. It's how we use it. Take Christianity, for example. Some people use the Christian tradition in the most beautiful, wonderful, beautiful way. Just so beautiful. Just wonderful lives that are rich with service and compassion and personal growth.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Others may not. Others may use it as a weapon or as an ego tool, and that's it. That's the nature of form, not just religious form. All form, we get to choose what we do with it. How are you going to use any given form, whether it be a hammer or a religion, in love or fear?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Each individual being unique, there are times when forms very much will help us. Traditions very much will help us. I really enjoy the tradition of non-duality personally. It's probably the least defined tradition in that sense, but I love non-duality because it aligns so much with the piece of being that I seek and that I know.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I'm happy to participate in other forms of expression that also point to the divine in their own way. Really, all religions ultimately at the root, when they're being used in alignment with love, they all point back to the truth of being, whether it be the world is an illusion message of Buddhism or the message of service that Jesus teaches.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's all potentially beautiful and usable for personal growth. Is there a God? Once again, the words are very tricky, but to be the most succinct possible, yes. But that word is very, very weighted for many people. I personally love the word God. I've met a lot of people who really don't like the word God because of the context that's been used.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But if you're speaking about the living, conscious, deeply conscious, loving, knowing, I am-ness that is all that is, and is both personal and transcendent and our closest ally and friend and source, yes, that exists for sure. The source is the most real, actually. It's what we're all seeking, you could say, actually.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We're always looking for the satisfaction somewhere. We're missing something here. I don't feel good right now. What about now? What substance can I take? What food can I eat? What person can I pursue? What video game can I play? You know, whatever. We're always trying to fill that hole.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We never fill the hole. We're seeking source, God, whatever word you want to use. The wholeness that is our true nature. I love the Rumi quote, "You are not just a drop in the ocean. You are the mighty ocean in the drop." And that mighty ocean, the whole ocean, which vastly transcends us and yet which towards we are working towards and are a part of, that is very real and I would call that God.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But it's certainly beyond any language and any description. In fact, it gives rise to all form and all description and all names, all qualities arise from it. It's not like qualities preceded. So it's really hard to try to put words on all that is, you know, you just, or source. You know, source is, it's just not nameable.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You're doing a great job. Is there anything else you would like to share today about pre-birth memories? Regarding pre-birth memories, I'll just reiterate, I don't think it's super important that we have memory or not, but I will reiterate that whoever you are listening today, you really are more than the human character.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And whether you remember it or not, you did exist before you were human. You had some kind of pre-birth experience, whether or not you remember it. But that's not even that unusual because we have non-physical experiences every night when we sleep. We could just say, we are each extra-dimensional beings.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, that's what we are. We are beings that are multi-dimensional and powerful beings of life, individuals of knowing and spirit. And that is what we are. And it's not strange then that we all have so many experiences in that context that transcend the human condition, even though we don't remember it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But while we're here, please do be encouraged. This life is an incredible opportunity, and there's so much we can do every day. We don't have to live in fear, and we don't have to take our story so seriously. This is just a play. We can use it for fun. We can have fun.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And as an individual, you have so much more power than you may be consciously aware of. Not just power in the quality of your own life. Power to help and heal the whole collective. We're all connected. We're all part of the collective consciousness of humanity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If you meet one fear, if you express love in a genuine way in one moment, you are helping to solution the entire world, to heal the entire world. And that is a wonderful thing. And that's what we're here to do. Not so much the pre-wrist stuff. We'll get back to that side. We'll deal with that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We'll have a much greater vantage point when we get back there. For now, here we are on Earth. It's time to do our best to meet this experience fully with open eyes, open hearts, and really see what can we do with this moment. And that can be a wonderful process that's liberating, not one that's full of stress and difficulty.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Beautiful. Christian, thank you so much for bringing so much love and joy to all of us. Thank you for being with me today. Thank you. And thank you, whoever you are, for being human. Go out and do something awesome today. You know, love someone next to you or just go have some fun. Let's do it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, we're all in this together. Like everyone, I may not be able to see everybody that's listening today, but we're all brothers and sisters, all of us. And we are in this together, and we can do it. So let's do it. Let's do it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For those of you listening or watching, thank you for being with us.</p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">

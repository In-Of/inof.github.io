Christian, welcome to the show.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Thank you, Christina. It's an honor to be here.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> I'm so honored to have you here. Since I saw your first podcast, I couldn't wait to have a conscious conversation with you. So, with that being said, are you ready to get started?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Absolutely. Thank you.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> So, Christian, when I heard your story about remembering your pre-birth experience, one of the things that really impacted me the most was when you described how you met this being, and there was some quality about that being, and you were curious. Once you learned that that being spent time on Earth, your soul said, "I really want to do that." That jumped out to me. I immediately felt that knowing who I am in this body, in this time-space Earth reality. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I immediately was like, "I know my soul did that too." And so, I think many of us do, even if we don't recall. I think many of us have been similarly inspired. In fact, I heard Bob Monroe, the famous out-of-body explorer, make a comment to that effect a while ago after I had shared it. I remember him saying that many of us come because we become inspired by a being who has come, and we see the potential and the expansion and the love and the joy that's within them, and we just say, "I want to do that." And that's so what I experienced. So, I love it. I love that he said that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, yeah. And what impacted me most was that, you know, I've signed up for... I have had a lot of challenges in my life, mostly around addiction and being a single mom for 18 years. Those are my two big challenges. And many, many times, I have felt victimized by this planet. So, the reason—one of the main reasons—I wanted to talk to you was because it was so inspiring to hear that we choose to be here. Yeah. So, could you talk about that a little bit for me?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, we do choose to be here. And I know it can feel like we're victims when we're here because the level of constraint that we're dealing with here is very high. So, when I say that, what I mean is like, we feel separate from each other, and we feel bound by biology—what our biology limits us to—and all the constraints of the physical universe, like linear time and discrete location. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, these things that we think are so obvious, they're actually really alien to us. It's a very, very dense experience by comparison to be human. It's like wearing a heavy coat—like wearing a 500-pound coat or something. You know, and then once we're wearing this 500-pound coat, we say, "Oh my gosh, this is heavy." Right? It is. It can be heavy. Yeah. But the spirit is deeper than that. Like, we know from that perspective that the limitation is actually an opportunity. And so, that's why we come.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> I love that. So, you said the limitation is an opportunity. Yeah, it can yield opportunity depending on how we respond to it. The key is... So, it's not that limitation itself causes an effect, and it's not that suffering is good or something like that. You know, because I think a lot of people kind of tie those things together, and then they think, "Oh, well, that means pain is good. I came here to suffer." No. It's just that when the limitations are high, we might respond in fear. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when we respond in fear, we suffer a lot because we put all this negative meaning on our lives, and we reject what we're experiencing. You know, we feel a lot of pain. It's not about the limitation. The active ingredient is how we respond—like what we do with it, the quality of being that we bring into it and through it, like how we meet whatever has arisen. That is where the real quality is. You know, so when we talk about... I've used the analogy that being physical is like lifting weights on a weight bench. So, like, the action of pushing up the weights can mean a lot of different things, but the simplest way to put it is having a loving intention rather than a fearful intention. And love can mean so many things. It can mean perseverance when things are difficult. It can mean acceptance when something is really hard to accept. You know, it can mean choosing compassion in a situation where it's not easy to choose compassion. There's just so many things that it can possibly mean. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, it's that the limitation is giving us that context, and I call it the counter-pressure of circumstance. You know, circumstances giving us this counter-pressure, we get to then pit ourselves into it and against it—you could say. I don't want to say "against" because it's not like the physical world is in any way adverse to us. There's no opponent. I just mean that we are able to shine who we really are in and through it by making choices and by bringing forth a certain quality of being. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that's like... I saw you just put it in a metaphor. Like, you could say when you're sitting on your couch, it's really easy to, I don't know, watch <em>Survivor</em>, the show <em>Survivor</em>. You know, when people are out on the island, and they're starving, and they're having to do all these physically demanding challenges, and then vote each other out in this reality show, right? It's one thing to be on the couch. It's another thing to go there and starve and have to make choices. Physically incarnating is a little bit like that. You know, like, it's one thing to say, so to speak—I don't want to limit this too much with words—but it's one thing to say, "I am of joy, and I love you." It's another to actually be on the desert island starving. It's another to be here and be a single parent or to have someone... to be someone who has an illness or something, and then to see how you respond. You know, that's another thing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah. So, here's the long answer. No, it's okay. I love it all. There's so many different threads that I want to go with that. But what you just said about being with an illness or with some sort of limitation—I remember in your story, when you chose to come here, you saw like a blueprint or like a flowchart kind of of what that would be. So, do we know the limitations or the possibilities of limitations before signing up too?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yes. So, yeah, we do. We do. What we see is the context—the full context. We have a really good view of the circumstances, the body, the parents, the society, and all the prediction of how that life might unfold. I use the word "prediction" because that's really what the pre-life review is. It's not set in stone. You know, it's not like you're reading a script now that you just have to go live out. It's not like that. It's that you start from a point of being incarnated and being born—actually, incarnation often happens before birth; it's actually pre-birth—but you start from this point, and then as you experience birth and growing up and getting older and going and making all these choices, there's so many things that might unfold. And the system is just really good at predicting that. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, we can see the potentials. But what I reviewed primarily wasn't events. I mean, there were events in it. What was of primary interest is what it would be like to be me—like to have the experience of being Christian. You know, because really, what's going on here is you're having an experience, I'm having an experience, the person listening today is having an experience. And the nature of that experience is what's really going on. It's not so much about the events happening or the circumstances happening, but it's like, what does it feel like to be you? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, right? So, that was what I reviewed before. It was like, what would it feel like to be Christian, and what avenues might unfold, and how might it feel to be exactly in that place, like even right now, you know, all the way out this far into the life? What is it like? What does it feel like to be me? I don't know if that describes it well. So, we do see that ahead of time, and we see the opportunity that that affords. And we do sign up, even though part of that is forgetting that we did that.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Veil of Forgetting**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Veil_of_Forgetting**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Veil of Forgetting</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the natural process of forgetting past lives and pre-birth experiences is discussed, along with how memories can sometimes resurface through meditation or spiritual practices." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_natural_process_of_forgetting_past_lives_and_pre-birth_experiences_is_discussed,_along_with_how_memories_can_sometimes_resurface_through_meditation_or_spiritual_practices."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the natural process of forgetting past lives and pre-birth experiences is discussed, along with how memories can sometimes resurface through meditation or spiritual practices.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yes. I was just going to ask you because, you know, we're talking about you because you remember. And like, I don't remember. I resonate with everything that you say, and I just do know now that somewhere I had a similar experience. But you remember. So, what I was going to ask is, is that similar to all souls that decide to incarnate on Earth—or in Earth? I know you say there's no distance, so is it "on Earth" or "in Earth"?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> It's that the Earth is appearing in us, actually.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Oh, I love that. Yeah. So, you just said Earth is appearing on the movie screen of your awareness. Your awareness already existed before, but anyway, not to get away from your question.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, yeah. No, I was just going to ask about that because, you know, we typically—and I know for myself, even though intellectually I have read so many things, I've meditated, I've had experiences—most of the time, I walk around believing that I am in my body. Yeah, that's normal.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, that's normal. But really, the body is occurring in our minds. Would you say that's correct, or how would you describe that?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Nature of Consciousness**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Nature_of_Consciousness**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Nature of Consciousness</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian explains how the body and physical form exist within awareness, not the other way around, and how deep introspection can reveal our true nature." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_explains_how_the_body_and_physical_form_exist_within_awareness,_not_the_other_way_around,_and_how_deep_introspection_can_reveal_our_true_nature."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian explains how the body and physical form exist within awareness, not the other way around, and how deep introspection can reveal our true nature.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, the body—I don't want to specify it to the mind. The mind is the experience. The body is occurring in our awareness, in consciousness itself. So, as a very small tangent, but I just find this helpful—like today, if you lift up your hand and you spend a few moments closing your eyes and feeling the aliveness in your hand—I'm doing this because it's very tangible; it's very right now, right here—the aliveness in your hand. How do you know that you have a hand? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You can ask yourself that with your eyes closed, and you might feel like air moving across the surface of your skin. I don't mean that sensory experience; I mean the aliveness that's in your hand. Do you feel that aliveness? So, that aliveness—I won't go into a full exercise here—but if that aliveness is itself the living consciousness that you are, it was already there, and it doesn't have a boundary to it, actually. It doesn't have an edge. Like, if you investigate that aliveness closely, you'll find there's no edge. Right? There's the experience of an edge as wind blows across your fingertips, and you feel a bounding. I'm doing it actually right now. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah. So, anyway, so what happens is—I mean, that's a very simple example, but I think it is actually really powerful because if you go far enough into that direction, there is what I will—I don't want to make this sound stimulating for the ego—but there is an inversion point where, if you go deep enough into it, all of a sudden, it all kind of flips around, and you can become very tangibly, experientially aware that the physical sensory data is occurring within you, and that your body of awareness is actually way bigger than the little sensory data. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But anyway, usually on Earth, as we walk around, we become deeply associated with the form—you know, with the sense data, the sight, the sound, the touch, and the thoughts, all the thoughts. And the more we focus on it, the more firm and real it is. And that's what the veil permits. The veil just permits us to kind of get lost in and focus deeply within the form. But like children, for instance, who haven't been here as long—you know, really young, young babies—they don't have as much form association yet, so they come and go a lot more freely. They're a lot more open to it. Usually, by the age of like, I don't know, four, five, six, something like that, you know, now you've got an identity. Your parents have told you who you are a few hundred times, and you've really started to focus into it. We all tend to do that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, back to your original comment, I did not remember the majority of my adult life. You know, I had no memory between the ages of six, approximately, and 30. My body's 43 right now, and when the memory returned to me, it was very like the most natural thing in the world. It occurred after I took up a long-term meditation practice, and I was able to—I was no longer so deeply associated with the form. I really deeply investigated that aliveness, that consciousness that is here now. And I didn't expect anything. It's just that once we go in that direction far enough, deeper aspects of our self rise up all on their own. Yeah.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah. I don't know if that speaks to your question.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> My original question—I don't actually have the information. Well, this might be a roundabout way of getting to the question, but so, you mentioned that you didn't remember from about five or six to the age of 30.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> The other day—and we're all veiled, correct? Like, we're all veiled when we come here, so yes, we can be in this experience so we can be human.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> So, the other day, my son and I—we talk about the truths of the universe, and we talk about God a lot, and what our purpose is here—and he asked me, "Why do we forget?" And I was doing my best to tell him what I think I know, and he said to me—he's eight—he said, "Wait, so you know how we don't remember much before we're three or four? Is that because we actually do remember, and then we learn all the things that humans learn on this planet?" And I thought, "Wow, my kid is so..." That's not a bad thought.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, yeah. The neurological system has to develop, and it's... So, you know, we start blank. Like, when I remember the day I was born, I had no understanding of what was going on at all. You know, so we start with like a blank slate as the human character, but we—the deeper us—is we are absolutely not a blank slate in how we arrive. You know, we—the soul—has a ton of experience it brings with it and arrives with. And yeah, so then the veiling allows you then to get lost in, so to speak, the human character, so that you can have the experience of just being that person and just having that experience and having the perspective of being that person and not the perspective of being all that is.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, yes. And I remember—I don't know if it was an interview that I saw from you sharing your story or if it was in your book—but I remember you sharing an experience about being three or four, and you just had this assumption that everyone could feel each other's feelings, and you were so excited. And it brought back a memory of when I was young, and my parents had friends over for dinner, and I just remember being so excited to jump into the conversation, and they all laughed at me, and I cried, and I ran.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Oh, yeah. Because you couldn't articulate yet, right?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> And because I—I must have... I am an empath; I'm very sensitive, so I can feel a lot of what is around me. But I remember I was so excited to share it, like telepathically, with them.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Telepathy and Connection Beyond the Physical**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Telepathy_and_Connection_Beyond_the_Physical**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Telepathy and Connection Beyond the Physical</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the idea of telepathic communication and interconnectedness beyond the physical realm is explored, emphasizing how awareness transcends human perception." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_idea_of_telepathic_communication_and_interconnectedness_beyond_the_physical_realm_is_explored,_emphasizing_how_awareness_transcends_human_perception."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the idea of telepathic communication and interconnectedness beyond the physical realm is explored, emphasizing how awareness transcends human perception.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, it's telling because, in higher systems, it's just like that. You show up, you're excited, and you want to connect, and that automatically happens because intention—we're telepathically connected all the time. We still are telepathically connected, actually. It's just that most of us are quite unaware of it on a routine basis. So, I totally relate to what you're saying. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah. And then, as a kid, you don't have the language yet to... You don't have—it takes a lot of practice to be able to then take all the thoughts and ideas and turn them into words and throw them at somebody else in a way that makes sense. Yeah, that's a very clunky way to interact.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Right. Yeah. So, okay, that brings me to another curiosity. You said we are all still telepathic. So, one of the things that as I started learning about my empathy—and you know, my kids—I start talking, and they're like, "Mom, how are you in my brain? How did you know I was thinking that?" And my answer is, "We're all one mind." But they think I'm psychic or a witch, and I'm like, "Well, we all have that capability."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Oh, yes, absolutely. No, it's the norm. When I say the norm, I mean—on Earth, it may not be the norm all the time, but as spiritual beings, in most higher systems, we tangibly feel and know our connection with each other and with the environment all the time. And so, telepathic exchange—that is the exchange of not only ideas but feelings—is just the natural, efficient way of interaction. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, if you want to—there's no room for misinterpretation when you're sharing exactly what you're thinking and feeling and intending, and they can see it, and you can feel them. You know, that's what we're kind of used to. And that includes information and data. So, now that we're on Earth, it's like—put it this way—we're still connected to the database. The database that's running the simulation is a part of us; it's a part of spirit. So, it's actually not far. It's not hard to reach. It's just that when we're veiled, we often are quite obscured from it because we're so focused on the clunky thoughts and the clunky sense data and the clunky everything—you know, the denseness. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Usually, that intuitive connection is very fast, very instantaneous, kind of comes in complete chunks. And it can be inexplicable. Like, you might know something that you have no conscious, on the human level, way to know that because you are connected to the information, to the source of it all. And it's quite normal. And then, if we develop close relationships with others—especially if the relationships are genuinely loving, in a real, genuine love—that's like an open bridge. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, then telepathic exchanges can happen much more normally. Like, really close friends or—like last night, my wife and I were sitting in bed, and I was reading something, and then I just had this telepathic thought, like, "Would you scratch my back?" I didn't even ask it verbally, and she reached out and scratched my back. And she was reading something, and she just did it. And then I kind of laughed out loud, and she said, "Why did you laugh?" And I was like, "Well, because I just asked you to scratch my back, but I didn't bother to speak, and you still heard it." You know, so it's—anyway, so that kind of stuff does happen. Yeah, those are fun experiences.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Clunkiness of Physical Reality**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Clunkiness_of_Physical_Reality**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Clunkiness of Physical Reality</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian compares physical life to a slowed-down, denser version of higher realities and explains how consciousness shapes experience." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_compares_physical_life_to_a_slowed-down,_denser_version_of_higher_realities_and_explains_how_consciousness_shapes_experience."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian compares physical life to a slowed-down, denser version of higher realities and explains how consciousness shapes experience.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> I know that there's a lot more threads now that I want to go down, but you mentioned database and clunkiness. So, for listeners that might be not sure of who you are or new to some of this kind of content, can you explain what that means—the clunkiness?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, so, all we know is the physical, so it's hard for us to understand how this could be clunky, right? But in comparison to our higher states of being that are less constrained, everything here is very dense and slow and clunky. I don't know what other word to use, by comparison to the speed and rapidity and fullness of action that takes place in higher states. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, maybe I don't know if this metaphor is going to be helpful, but like, if you imagine going to an IMAX movie theater and then going and watching a TV show on a 20-inch black-and-white TV screen, the black-and-white TV screen is much smaller, it's black-and-white, it can't convey nearly the same bandwidth of content. We get used to the black-and-white movie screen. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Being on Earth is like living in a black-and-white movie by comparison to the vividness and the realness of higher states. And so, this shift, this change, is not just in sensory data; it's in vibration. So, what I mean is—oh, this is hard to describe—our higher state is very open and connected, and our local state is very dense and firm, you could say. And so, it takes... For instance, on Earth, if we intend something, it does not automatically immediately happen. Like, if I intend right now to go to California, it's just—the odds of that happening are almost impossible. I'm not going to expect that; that's not how it works. But in thought-responsive systems—higher systems that are much more fluid—if you intend something, if you think something, it immediately happens. It immediately affects the environment, and it's real. Like, you can see it; I mean, it's very tangible. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, here on Earth, it's still actually our intention and our thoughts that have an effect. It's just a lot slower, and there's a lot of us in the game. There's a few billion of us playing, at least just in the human roles, not to mention the other roles. And so, those intentions and those thoughts are building up thought momentum, and the thought momentum can translate into physical outcome, actually. It just takes time, usually.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> I liked how you described that. I noticed that as I was listening, I had this vision of like everything I see in front of me—my laptop, the microphone—it's there's edges, right? Like you said before, what—almost like it just turned into nothing, like colors or, you know, like you said, vibration. And it was almost like a fuzzy TV screen or something where it wasn't so hard or firm, like you said.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, it's the firmness is not just definition of objects. That's a part of it, but the reason I say that is because in higher systems, you can experience objects that are even more real, more tangible, more colorful, more whatever. It's just that here, there is a density of vibration that has come to the—I don't know how else to describe it other than to say there are layers of preceding energetic action that have taken place that have to culminate in a lot to reach this level of density and to actualize. So, we're like engaged in a very, very—like, we're locked into a position while we're incarnated. And this locked-in position is very low vibration by comparison but also very powerful because we're locked into such a dense position. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And in that very dense position, when we make hard choices—you know, when we deal with the feelings, the emotions, the strong human emotions, and the thoughts that might arise—the very loud thoughts that can arise or the circumstances that are so persistent here—you know, like someone dies, and they're gone the whole rest of your life—super persistent. That's a very dense kind of constraint. Then now that you're locked into having to face and deal with those constraints, how do you respond then? You know, like, how do you respond if you have an illness that lasts not just a month but a year or not just a year but 10 years? After 10 years, how are you responding? You know, that level of persistence and consistency and density is one of the great values of Earth, you know, because now you really have to pick. Now you really have to decide how you're going to respond.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, I just really felt that "locked in" when you said that. I can't describe the feeling, but I felt it in my core—like, locked in.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Whereas locked in—or as locked in as we can get. I mean, that's like the technology of the veil—is that it allows us to lock into this very dense, high-opportunity position. And it's one heck of a ride, you know, for sure.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> We're describing the black-and-white movie in the IMAX movie. So, I'm very deep into the work of <em>A Course in Miracles</em> and <em>The Way of Mastery</em>, and they often—they're channeled by Jesus—and they often depict the comparison that this is a movie. So, there's a couple pieces I want to ask you about here. One is that our choice is to tune into which movie we're going to be watching—the one that's led by ego or the one that's led by God. Do we actually—can you talk about free will and, you know, do we actually create our own reality?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Free Will and the Power of Intention**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Free_Will_and_the_Power_of_Intention**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Free Will and the Power of Intention</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the discussion shifts to how individuals and societies collectively create reality, highlighting the importance of intention and conscious choice-making." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_discussion_shifts_to_how_individuals_and_societies_collectively_create_reality,_highlighting_the_importance_of_intention_and_conscious_choice-making."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the discussion shifts to how individuals and societies collectively create reality, highlighting the importance of intention and conscious choice-making.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> We do create our own reality, both individually and collectively. And the collectively part is a big one on Earth. So, while we're human, we focus an awful lot on how the physical has actualized. We focus a lot on how the objects are placed today—you know, who's got what, who's doing what, what's the new image that's on TikTok, you know, whatever—who's leading this company today or who. We're really focused on those kinds of events. Okay, but the important thing is the quality of being with which we are meeting the objects that have arisen and what kind of decisions we are making in response. So, we can say that's called choice-making—you know, what choices do we make? But there's actually something that's taking place deeper than the choice itself, and that is intent—intention. It's the best word we have. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I just mean, at the deepest level, as a spiritual being, what is the what and why you are making the choices you're making today? What is the quality with which you are making your choices, honestly? You know, because you can't fool the universe. Like, you know, your actual motivations are your actual motivations. You can fool yourself—you know, well, you can at the ego level quite a bit. The deeper part of you, of course, knows it's still seen. So, what I mean is, what is that quality of intention? That's what this whole game is—is what is the quality of your intention with which you meet any given moment, any given choice? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Are you responding out of fear and rejection and ego that is trying to grab onto some power that seems to have been lost because now you feel separate from everybody else, and you don't have power, and now I've got to get some money, or now I've got to control this person next to me, or now I've got to belong to the right group or believe the right thing, you know, whatever? Or are we choosing to have patience with ourselves and others, compassion? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Are we choosing ownership, perseverance? You know, are we choosing to relate to the present moment in a way that is more in alignment with the love and the peace and the joy and the freedom of our true nature? Because our true nature is love and peace and joy and freedom. That is our true nature—always, always, always. No matter how deeply we get wrapped into the horror stories that we've created for ourselves on Earth, and no matter how much fear we have in response to the horror story we've erected, our true nature is always that love and that peace and that joy. So, can we make choices that are in alignment with that? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when we do that, like, we feel joy. You know, we feel the freedom and peace. People say, "Well, how do you know if you're wielding an intention that's in alignment with love?" You'll feel it. You'll feel one step closer to freedom, one step closer to joy, one step closer to fullness of fulfillment. You'll feel fulfilled. You know, like, there's a deep satisfaction when you actually help the person next to you, when you actually love the person next to you, when you're on your own crap. Yeah, after decades of tormenting yourself or causing pain for others, when you finally look at your own fear and say, "Wow, I have a lot of fear," when you really face that and own that—you know, those are powerful moments. That's what we're here to do.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Powerful and electric intention. You can't trick your intention. And as soon as I read the title, I was like, "I felt like I got it already." But then after I read it, you know, I just really resonated with what you've said. We can't—you know, and I know if I look back through my life, when I was lying to myself or trying to trick myself, you know, because it wasn't ever ill intention; it was just I didn't know better.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, no, it's asleep. Egoic action is very largely unconscious.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah. And then what I loved about your previous interviews and what I really wanted to talk to you about was the intention of love. And I think that you know, several times you've mentioned in your book and in other interviews that that is our purpose, and that is actually what got me to start paying attention. I was coming out of treatment for an eating disorder, and my treatment team said, "Go be around 12-step, go be around recovery, go find a church or a spiritual center."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I opened up the calendar to one of these spiritual centers, and it said there was a group called "Real Love." I didn't look at the sermons; I wasn't going to go to those, but I saw "Real Love" was a group, and I had no idea what that was, but I was like, "That sounds like something I need." And that's what started everything. Well, I'm sure it started in treatment, but the book was <em>Real Love</em> by Greg Baer, and that's—for 14, 15 years now—it's been my intention to learn how to love unconditionally. So, can you talk about love a little bit on the other side here?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The True Nature of Love**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_True_Nature_of_Love**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The True Nature of Love</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian describes love as the fundamental essence of existence, contrasting it with fear, and explaining how love aligns with our deepest truth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_describes_love_as_the_fundamental_essence_of_existence,_contrasting_it_with_fear,_and_explaining_how_love_aligns_with_our_deepest_truth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian describes love as the fundamental essence of existence, contrasting it with fear, and explaining how love aligns with our deepest truth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, so when we talk about love, it's one of those things that's almost impossible to actually talk about. But when we talk about love, we tend to talk about the feeling, the emotion, and then we think about what type of love—like, you know, the Greek sets of seven or eight or however many different words for love—sorry, I don't remember, but there was like familiar love, romantic love, friendship love, and so on. When I use the word love, it's just the best word that we have. It means that which resonates with and aligns with our true nature. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because our true nature—we are all one; we're all connected and a part of each other. We're all drops in the one ocean. Love is that which then is in alignment with the truth of that connectedness. It honors it; it celebrates it. Love is like a boundless celebration. It's the nature of life. It's lifting up the other and the beauty of creation and celebrating the beauty of existence itself—or not even needing a form but yet serving the other, not just as the self but as wonderful. I don't know how to describe it. Whereas fear is the opposite. I mean, it's not duality itself is transcendent, so I don't mean to make it sound like there's a true opposite called fear. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Fear is a non-native response. It's a response to a non-native set of limitations wherein we buy into a perception that's not in alignment with the truth. So, if we feel powerless, we feel fear because our true nature is very powerful. Or if we feel that we're not worthy of love, we feel fear, and then we do whatever we can to try to fill that hole. Or if we feel shameful or we don't have control—you know, all of these boil down to some of the root ones: not perceiving you have power or perceiving you're not worthy of love, and a few others. Anytime we bind to those perceptions that are not in alignment with who we really are, that can prompt fear precisely because we are losing ourselves in the perception of being something we're not. You see? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now it's like, "I'm not loving; I'm not loved and amazing." And, "Oh my gosh, I'm disgusting; I'm gross." You know, and then we respond in fear. But I like to say that fear is just yet unevolved. It's just a synonym for that because it just means that there's a part of our experience here that we haven't yet fully integrated. When we fully integrate the experience, when we fully accept ourselves in everything we feel, when we fully feel it all—yes, when we do that, there is a profound expansion out to that point, and we discover the love and the peace and the joy that we really are never left. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We never ever lost it. We never lost it. But now we've gone out to this limitation—this circumstance, this relationship, this drug addiction, you know, whatever it is—and when we really integrate that and find who we really are in it and heal it, now we've expanded out to that point. The native love, the native joy, and the native freedom that you already are and never lost—like, we never ever ever lose that. So, back to your original point, love is what we are. It's just the description of what we really are. And in a lot of near-death experiences, people return, and they can't even put into words the absolutely profound depths of blissful love that exists. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There's just no way that we can possibly articulate it. It is absolutely unconditional. I know some people really get up in arms on that because they want to defend conditionality because of beliefs, but there's no—it's completely unconditional. Yeah, love is an unconditional acceptance and lifting up and empowering of the other—the apparent other.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yes. I love that you just brought that into the conversation because one of the practices I've been doing—I'm doing <em>A Course in Miracles</em>; I'm doing all the lessons all over again. So, there's 365 days of lessons, and a lot of the first part of those lessons is, you know, I guess ingraining in our minds—I don't know, imprinting—that everything's neutral, and that's what we put meaning into everything that we see. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I know you've talked about that. I was just going to say that I feel like one of <em>A Course in Miracles</em>' great strengths is that it is attempting to—so, I personally feel like sometimes the language is difficult to understand, and sometimes perhaps even less helpful because of the very specific meaning of some of the language. But anyway, overall, I find it to be a valuable exercise in re-relating yourself to form—form meaning sensory data, thoughts, objects, ideas—because, like you said, it is all neutral. Like, when you're a baby, and you know, babies are just—they don't have any meaning tied to it; they're just experiencing sensory data, and they don't even know what it means yet, right? You can locate how deeply you are associated with form if you whisper your name to yourself. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You'll notice this very strong pull to identification with your name. You're not your name. You're not even a human. You're not male or female. You're having the experience of being this name and being this human who is male or female. And so, <em>A Course in Miracles</em> can be really helpful because it is very helpful to spend actual time—we have to take linear time to practice, to do these practices, to practice meditation, and to locate your own relationship with form. And then, when you do that, what happens is—not because you're trying, but as your relationship with form changes and as you open, larger parts of yourself and of the truth just can rise up on their own. Like, all of a sudden, you might feel this amazing peace, and it's like—and as soon as you do, you know, the ego is like, "Oh my God, that was amazing. How did I do that? That was amazing. I've got to get that; I've got to grab that again." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It tries to grab onto it. I know—cling. Got to cling. I understand. But that's okay. You know, that's okay. So, if we notice the neutrality of the form, then there is the space that we create for that bliss and that joy to arise. All form actually is neutral—even pain. I know that's really hard, but like, I remember the last time I had the stomach flu. I really—there's certain—I'm very sensitive; I'm a very sensitive person. There's a lot of the human limitations that have been difficult for me to fully accept. And one of those things is being nauseated or vomiting. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm not a fan of that. I don't think anybody is, but I really don't like it. So, the last time I had the stomach flu, I was laying on the floor in my bathroom, and I just tried to really identify the sensation itself. Like, I don't need to reject this; I don't need to resist this. And then I noticed—not this is not a disassociation; actually, it's actually a move away from this. It's a full awareness, full alertness. I noticed that, in full alertness, even the sensation of vomiting was just—it was happening. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was neutral. It didn't need to be a source of suffering. And there's actually a—oh, I don't know how to describe this without making this sound improper—but like, there's actually a joy beneath all experience—even painful experience. It's the resistance that hurts. I'll just say it's the resistance that hurts. It's the meaning that we put on it. It's a rejection of ourselves or of somebody else that hurts. "I'm not good enough unless I look a certain way, unless I do a certain thing, or unless I respond a certain way." No, no, no, no, no. That's not true. You are a beautiful, powerful being, and all you have a choice then in how you respond to all the neutrality—all the neutral, dense but neutral form that has arisen in the physical experience.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Neutrality of Experience**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Neutrality_of_Experience**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Neutrality of Experience</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the conversation explores how all experiences, even painful ones, are inherently neutral, and it is our perception that assigns meaning to them." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_conversation_explores_how_all_experiences,_even_painful_ones,_are_inherently_neutral,_and_it_is_our_perception_that_assigns_meaning_to_them."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the conversation explores how all experiences, even painful ones, are inherently neutral, and it is our perception that assigns meaning to them.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, I love how you describe that. So, one of the things that I do is I facilitate authentic relating modalities. I'm not sure if you're familiar, but one of them is called Circling, and what we do is just explore what it's like to be us in the body, in the room, in the present, without labeling it. And a couple of months ago, I was playing basketball with my son and my daughter, and I'm really competitive, so I was really into it, and I sprained my ankle—like, really, really bad. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I was resisting until I was sitting there, and I noticed that where my ankle was, it just felt like this big ball of pain. I went into the pain, and it was a big ball, and it felt like kind of mushy, and it was such a crazy experience because it hurt—my body said it hurt really bad—and I had to crawl around. It was a really bad sprain. And what was that ball made of? It was like energy. It felt—I don't feel it now, so it's hard, but I noticed it was like a puffiness that, you know, kind of almost like it was protecting my ankle in a weird way. And so, yeah, I just loved how you described that because that's what one of the things that I know gave me a lot of relief when I started learning the truth of who I am was that, "Oh, if we put meaning into this, and my thoughts are creating my feelings, and my feelings feel like they're suffering," yeah, well, that's a little bit of freedom, a little bit exactly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Oh, yeah, no, and then that rabbit hole goes very deep because we really are incredibly free, but we have put a ton of meaning on the physical. And then what happens is, the ego even tries to justify its lack of control. You know, like, "No, no, I don't have power because that means that I actually have to—there's some reason that I have my egoic excuses." Well, that's why quality of intention is so important because we have to have the willingness—we don't have to, but we may choose or may not choose if we wish—the willingness to acknowledge the quality with which we're even making that choice. Like, as an example, some people are afraid of success. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I know it sounds crazy, but some people don't want to—for whatever reason, it might be fear of failing, so they don't want to succeed because then they can't lose the thing they fear to get—you know, to lose whatever it is. At the bottom of all of our little games we play within ourselves, you know, where is the fear? And that's why it's so powerful to directly find and face our fears. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, and find that when we go into them, ultimately, it may feel really terrifying. I'm not making light of the depths of fear. I'm here to face fear. I do not make light of it. But when we really go into that closet—I use this metaphor in my book, and I've shared it before, but I'll just share it super quickly—when my father was a little child, a kid, he would lay in his bed, and he would look at this closet in his bedroom every night, and he was terrified of the monsters in the closet. And every night, he had problems falling asleep, and he was just—he lost his peace over these monsters in the closet. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One night, he said, "You know what? Screw this. Enough's enough. I'm going into that closet. I'm going to find those monsters because I'm sick of being afraid." And he charged into the closet, and he felt through the clothes, and he sat on the floor, and he expected that he would be eaten, but nothing happened. There were no monsters in the closet. Right? So, today, as an adult, my father is not afraid of closets. Now, I know that sounds silly, but our fears are like that. We torture ourselves for years, resisting something, and then when we eventually go into the closet and really go in there and really feel everything, we find there was nothing ever ultimately to be afraid of. This is the place where we can test that to the extremes, man.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, the extremes. I love that. One of my first sponsors told me this, and so I've been sober from drugs and alcohol for—it'll be 10 years in December—December 7th.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Congratulations.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Thank you. Yeah, talk about miracles—they are real. She said to me, "You know, you're just going to the edge of fear to see it isn't real." And like, I'm so grateful that I had her as my first sponsor because the learning that I got, I've taken that with me everywhere. And I live in Phoenix, Arizona, in a desert. So, just about a month ago, there was a scorpion in the house. My daughter was like, "Whatever, we're going after it. If I get stung, I've already been stung, but looking at it—I don't care about being stung; that doesn't scare me. I can handle pain." But looking at it, and so we both used it as an opportunity to go to the edge of fear to see it isn't real. And you know, we felt everything in our—I mean, that was like the most contrast I have felt in a long time.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> That's wonderful. Yeah, it's amazing how even a small—I mean, a relatively small stimulus—we really can use it. Now, we're not saying go get yourself stung by a scorpion. That's not what we're saying. Yeah, but even that—like, I mean, it could be something silly like—this is another very silly example, and this is just personal, but it's the kind of thing that—like, a year so a few years into my awakening, as I was really waking up to my relationship with form, one night, I was standing at my toilet urinating, and I realized I was afraid of the feeling. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And there was no reason to be afraid, so I went into—but it's okay; there is a reason because I feel afraid. There's something. It was—and this sounds simple, but it was—I didn't really have control over the sensation. I mean, obviously, I could stop urinating if I wished, but that's not what I meant. I meant the feeling itself. Yeah, I didn't have control over the fan—like, at the very—this is such a simple, basic human experience, but yet it's dense. You know, everything that we do here is a density to it. So, I'm just saying that any simple interaction with form, we can use in that way.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Facing Fear as an Opportunity**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Facing_Fear_as_an_Opportunity**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Facing Fear as an Opportunity</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where a real-life encounter with a scorpion becomes an example of how fear can be used as a messenger for inner transformation." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_a_real-life_encounter_with_a_scorpion_becomes_an_example_of_how_fear_can_be_used_as_a_messenger_for_inner_transformation."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where a real-life encounter with a scorpion becomes an example of how fear can be used as a messenger for inner transformation.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> That's really cool. And then it's interesting because then, like, the scorpion tends to respond differently. Yeah, whatever it is—whatever the scorpion is, whatever it is. So, the thing is, I actually didn't see it. I saw a piece of fudge, and then my daughter saw it, and it ran under my bed. And we were going to bed, so like, I had way too much fear. There was no way I was going to sleep with that under there. So, we—you know, so I was like, trying to call a friend, but it was 10 o'clock at night. I had no one to come over, and so she was like, "All right, I'm going to help you. If I get stung..." And what I love about this is the quality of—you know, and this wasn't always the case for me—but you know, playing with the opportunities, the challenges, the things that do arise in our life as ways to experience. Right? That's what we're here to do—is experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Exactly. And it is like a big playground. It's like a big playground with apparently sharp objects in it. You know, it's a big playground. We—our true nature is so playful. We're just such playful, fun-loving beings at heart. Yeah, children are like that before they get conditioned out of it. Right? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We're all like that. Like, we're deeply playful, and this whole thing is kind of like, "Let's see how far we can take this creativity thing to the next level and really be dense and really get old and really have disease and really see what we can do with it." And it may not seem fun to the human ego at times. I'm not making light of the difficulties. I'm just saying that the spirit that has given rise to form is playful, and we can use all the form as like a big playground.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's amazing when you lose your fear—well, maybe not lose yourself—it's amazing when you've processed fear and really come to meet reality in a state of alertness. How much everything becomes a beautiful playground. It's amazing. Like, things that otherwise would not seem magical all of a sudden—there's magic everywhere. Yeah, like, it's amazing.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Recognizing Fear as a Messenger**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Recognizing_Fear_as_a_Messenger**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Recognizing Fear as a Messenger</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christina shares how fear can signal misaligned perceptions and be used as a tool for deeper understanding." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christina_shares_how_fear_can_signal_misaligned_perceptions_and_be_used_as_a_tool_for_deeper_understanding."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christina shares how fear can signal misaligned perceptions and be used as a tool for deeper understanding.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, that's been something recently that you know, my kids are actually joining me in it, so I'm super amazed and happy that they play along when they're with me. You know, they have to—they go to a different household, so I don't know what happens there, but you know, it's more like—not that I'm never going to be afraid, but that when I notice I feel afraid, that's an opportunity to get present to, "Oh, what's happening? You know, what's the message? What's the messenger?"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It feels like a messenger. It's like, "Hey, you have a perception that's not in alignment with the truth." And you're like, "Ah, man, I really do. What is it?" You know, and you can go find it. I noticed it can be sneaky, though. My kids—so, I'll—you know, I've been—I'm more relaxed now than I used to be, but I can be very OCD. And so, my son loves playing soccer, basketball, so he'll kick the ball around, and sometimes it'll hit things, and I'll say, "Liam, keep it on the ground." And he'll tell me—he'll say, "Mom, isn't that your ego being afraid that something's going to get broken?" </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, yeah. And I was willing to go that route. I can understand that. I mean, I feel like, you know, sometimes I respond in that way too, of course. And yeah, I feel like—I mean, part of it is prudence, like, you're trying to be prudent and right. So, finding that line—and I don't—but that's good. I mean, that's wonderful that he does. I mean, I feel like none of us should ever be afraid to have a question. You know, "Are you—is that a New York response?" And it's okay. Like, notice that the ego will immediately be like, "Oh, no, it's not an ego." It's okay if you're having an ego response. It's totally fine. You know, if you look at yourself and say, "Oh, okay, yeah, thank you."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, yeah. So, even that—like, one of the things that has been in my awareness lately and in the world is not to try to deny ego or push it away but rather to take that playfulness into, you know, when you're recognizing it's the ego or things to that effect. That's beautiful. Ego is—because the ego's not something separate. It's not like some separate structure that you're trying to get rid of and beat down with a stick. That's not how it works. It's just the part of it's you—yeah, when responding in fear—that's all. And having built up some structure as a response.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah. I'm curious because I've heard and read some similar but also—it's just my own understanding or lack of understanding. So, is the ego an illusion, or is it something we created? Like, I get stuck on that sometimes. What would you—?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, so the way that I use ego is the portion of the self that is responding in fear. I don't mean ego as in the existence of a separate human personality, which is how some people use the term. So, all form is not fundamental, including thoughts, emotions, patterns of the mind, including ego structures. Those are all not fundamental. They're all made of the stuff that is fundamental, though, which is consciousness, spirit. That's real. It's the most real thing. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then it loses itself in experiences of form for a while, but the realness of spirit endures and then has an experience of form. So, now I feel that it's important to not say that the experience itself isn't real. I know that some teachers say, "Oh, none of this is real." Well, it's like when you go to sleep at night, and you have a dream. When you wake up in the morning, it's pretty obvious now in your awake state that that was just a dream. It wasn't really real, but something did happen.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The thing that happened is you had an experience. And that is what's happening on Earth. It's like we're asleep in the dream of form, and we're having an experience. And then when we wake up, we realize, "Oh, I wasn't the human character." Yeah. And if the human character has an ego pattern, okay, you weren't really that either, but did you have an experience of being a human and wielding an egoic intent? Yeah, you had an experience. I think that's the best way I would—</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, I love that. And you mentioned dream. I'm 43 years old too. I'll be 44 next week—week and a half. This life—even though it's a dream—like, we go to bed at night, and the dreams feel like a few seconds, right? We wake up. So, our experience in this firmness and this denseness is that what makes it feel so long? And really, what I've heard is like, it's just like a blink.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, yeah. You could say that the linear time itself is a part of the denseness. And linear—so because of that, the experience—our experience of linear time can seem very long. I personally feel like this life has gone on for a ridiculously long time. Like, I know it sounds silly, but I feel like instead of 43 years, it feels like 43,000 years. That's how long it feels to me that I've been in this journey. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah. From the other perspective—that where we move closer to transcendent, you know, the—because we transcend linear time, our true nature transcends linear time. Then from that perspective, yes, it can seem like the blink of an eye. But once again, though, that timeless self has the experience of knowing length of time and knowing sequence. It gets a little—you could say linear time is like a way of knowing sequence or experiencing sequence.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Illusion of Time**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Illusion_of_Time**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Illusion of Time</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian explains how linear time is an experience rather than an absolute reality, and how meditation can alter our perception of time." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_explains_how_linear_time_is_an_experience_rather_than_an_absolute_reality,_and_how_meditation_can_alter_our_perception_of_time."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian explains how linear time is an experience rather than an absolute reality, and how meditation can alter our perception of time.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, that's a really interesting topic to get into—time. Like, I don't even know how to ask what I'm wanting to know right now, but when you mentioned sequence, it's like in this life, it's like we take one step and then another step, so it appears like it's sequential, but you know, when we access—when we get present and we access that now-ness, is that how is that to like the truth of what time actually is?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, that's a step towards the truth. So, time can feel different—very different. Sometimes meditation can feel like—if you're really meditating, it can feel like a very long time, very short time, both. But you were highly alert the whole time. It's not like when you fall asleep, and you're not alert. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A state of meditation is one of alertness—it's a beautiful alertness—and yet time moves differently because you are no longer focused into the radio channel of linear time. Not that you're trying to do that. You don't sit down and say, "Okay, I'm going to leave linear time now." Right? It's not how it works. It's just that as you focus away from this channel by focusing on your awareness itself, which already transcends the channel, you may step—you may automatically step beyond, at least somewhat, the linear time experience. Because, like I said, linear time is an experience; it's not really a thing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, I like how you do that. It's everything here is an experience more than it is actual objects. Got it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Well, I do notice that for a while, and I do have some questions. Sure, of course. So, the first question that I wanted to ask you specifically is, how would you define spirituality?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, okay. So, spirituality is about one's relationship to the present moment, and it's a very alert seeking of what is actually real. I think there's two main ideas about what spirituality means. So, what I mean is—I'll start with the second one. What is actually real means go investigate objectively what is your awareness itself beneath thoughts. You just go look—don't make anything up, no stories. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You don't have to make anything up. Be a scientist about it. You know, go explore and investigate. What am I underneath the—don't settle for thoughts. More thoughts will immediately come up. Your mind will say, "Oh, well, it must be a form; it must be this; it must be some idea." Go deeper. You know, find—go investigate. And so, spirituality is actually a move away from the illusion and the dream of form, which can never fully articulate the answers. The truth of being is always what you are, so it's always available to you. Yeah.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> You know, there's so many ideas or made-up constructs about what spirituality is, and so I love hearing the truth about what spirituality actually is.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, and then the first one—it's about your relationship to the present moment. So, that is—how are you using this? Well, how are you—what are you doing? Who are you right now? Like, I love—there's a Bashar quote that I love: "Circumstances don't matter; only state of being matters." And that's so powerful. It's not just this abstract thing; it really is incredibly powerful. So, spirituality is about refining that quality of being towards love and past fear. You know, that's really what all the—so then, you know, people of course say, "Oh, but I really benefit from a system—a belief system, an action." That's fine; that's good. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">ou know, we're physical; we're being as a form right now. So, where we are in form, we often benefit from form. You know, we can pursue a tradition; it's important to have time set aside for a spiritual practice. That's all important. It's just that spirit is much bigger than—transcends the form itself. It operates through form, but it isn't the form. The form isn't the name of the game. It's not what you believe specifically that's going to be the active ingredient. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That was like one of the main things Tom Campbell said back in the day—13 years ago—that kicked me down my awakening path. You know, like, it's not your belief itself that is going to be the active ingredient. What—how do you use belief? How do you use belief? What do you believe and why? You know, because many people use belief because it's terrifying not knowing. That's okay. When you're ready, it's okay to walk off that cliff and say, "I don't know. I don't know." It's amazing how many answers are there when we're ready to do that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, so I told you—I don't know if I did it while we were recording—but I have been using your book as an oracle, and today the message that I opened up to was "Thinking as Distinguished from Being." And I highlighted, "The only things that separate you from the native transcendence are the thoughts, judgments, and beliefs that you have decided to cling to and formalize over a lifetime." Yeah, so I love that. It circled right back to how I started my day.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> That's wonderful. Yeah, I know that's not simple because we really get deeply associated with the form. We take it really personally. You know, I understand. It's just that there isn't ever anything actually separating you from the fullness of who you are, and there is incredible joy in that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Oh, one other thing that I just felt strongly nudged to mention—the—okay, sometimes when we think about the action of moving away—it's not even an action, but I'll use the word action—sometimes when we think about the action of moving away from form towards the transcendent or from form towards awareness itself, we feel like we're going towards nothing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's like there's nothing there. Like, when you first start meditating, and you sit down, and you're like, "Oh my gosh, I have so many thoughts. I have to pay the bills; I've got to feed the dog; I've got to do the things." And then as you focus on something neutral or as you focus on the breath, and you take time, and you go, and you spend time, you go deeper into that. At first, it can feel like you're going towards nothing—like away from something which is real and towards nothing which is not real. But this is very important. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh my goodness, that awareness itself which transcends all form is full, not empty. Yeah, it's full of life, and it's full of tons of other form. So, some people who meditate a lot actively—and they're ready—they may experience out-of-body experiences. I know I've had out-of-body experiences—very eye-opening experiences. And when you have these experiences, they are not subtle. It's not like a little wishy-washy dream. It's like an IMAX movie in comparison to a black-and-white television. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that was always there, and it's actually incredibly fun. Yeah, but I'm just mentioning that because it seems at first like you're moving towards nothing when you're so deeply associated with dense and clunky form, but when you put down the dense and clunky form, things may rise up that are not nothing. They could—I could say there are other realities of form within our being, and they can be engaged as well, even as our beingness itself transcends all realities of form.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I loved how you said like—it's not really the word because I know that words don't really explain a lot of this stuff, or they can't actually describe it because everything is beyond words. But when you said it feels like we're moving towards nothing, it reminded me of some interviews that I've watched you in and things that I've experienced and read that there's nowhere actually to go, right? There's no distance. We're already here. Can you speak to that a little bit?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, just so—distance. When I say there's no distance, what I mean is the experience of distance is happening, but distance—physical distance itself is an illusion. It's not real. It's like logging into a video game. If you sit down and log into the World of Warcraft, and you're walking around Ironforge—you know, the name of a city in that game—there's—you're not—it's not really there. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, it's occurring on the screen, and it's in a computer. You can't go find Ironforge in the computer; it doesn't exist. So, the physical world is like that. It's an experience of sensory information that's arriving on and in your consciousness itself. And so, when you really—and so even believing in the distance helps the distance be real. Like, if you assume, "I'm trapped in my body; I have to get out if I want to have an out-of-body experience. I have to get out of this physical thing. I can see it; I can touch it. I need to escape this physical thing." Even that assumption is not super helpful because you are lending credence to the realness by believing it. In fact, the thing that's real is consciousness itself, and that consciousness itself is a part of the one great consciousness—the one mind, the source.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's all one consciousness; it's all connected. And we are always connected to it all the time. So, then when we go look at a sunset, so thinking all the time is like looking at a sunset and thinking while you're doing it, and you're not experiencing peace because you're thinking about this person who was mean to you at the office today. But when you fully let go and really, with alertness, be present with the sunset, you may feel the aliveness and the connectedness that is in the sunset, but it's your being. See, like, the sunset is in you. It's like a part of you, and you are marveling at the beauty of what is, and what is is occurring within you. It's a beautiful thing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, I love the way you describe that. And that reminds me—it actually leads right into my next question. I remember reading or listening—probably both—to when you felt like the sun and when you were coming into this life as Christian, and you were afraid, and you felt what he would call God. How would you—I know words aren't going to do great justice—but how would you define God?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> That's the hardest question. So, there are no words at all. We only can use metaphors. God is the sentient, loving, conscious foundation of all things—both personal and impersonal. God is the ocean of all that is, of which you are a drop—your soul being one inseparable drop of God. God is the most close friend and lover and parent and beyond all those things—the substance and the great "I Am" of all things. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The great "I Am" of all things or the source—I think would be the simplest ways to try to describe that we call God. But I could just say it's the thing that's most familiar to all of us. Like, we're all running around trying to find God every day. We might not call it that. You know, like, we're trying to fill this hole. We feel separate from each other; we feel powerless; we feel unworthy of love, and we've got to earn the love; we've got to fix the problem. We're all seeking that bliss of oneness that we already have with God. Yeah, I don't know what other words to use.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, I love how you said that though. It's what we're searching for all the time. So, whenever we're—when I got sober, it was step two: "Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity." And in that step, I had to redefine God from the way I was brought up to believe. And since then, my coaches, my sponsors, my mentors—whoever I'm working with—they got me to see that anytime I want to reach for anything external, all I'm really wanting is God. Yeah.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> So, one thing also that's beautiful—one synonym we can use for God is unconditional love and an absolutely unfathomable wisdom. So, I'm putting it that way because this thing that we're seeking is very much alive and real to each of us—the most familiar thing to each of us, the most holy thing to each of us. That one of the hardest parts about sharing my experience is it's so personal. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, it's like pulling down my pants. That's how I feel. But I'm not going to be afraid of that. You know, it's what we all are. It's just that that relationship is so holy. Yeah, and so real that it's—I feel like it's blasting me to even try to speak to it right now. But we all know that. You know, we all have that connection deep down. We all have that. You know, in Christian terms, we all have that relationship. I don't tend to use the word "relationship" because that implies it's totally something else, and you're over here, and it's over there, and you've got to relate with it. It's kind of like that. It is that, but it's also not that because you are it. It's your deepest nature.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Purpose of Life**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Purpose_of_Life**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Purpose of Life</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian summarizes the purpose of life as the expansion of love and joy through experience, learning, and conscious choice." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_summarizes_the_purpose_of_life_as_the_expansion_of_love_and_joy_through_experience,_learning,_and_conscious_choice."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian summarizes the purpose of life as the expansion of love and joy through experience, learning, and conscious choice.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> All right, my next question—I think we might have already talked about this, but probably in a different way. So, what would you say, having your experiences and your knowledge and your wisdom and just who you are—what would you say is the purpose of life?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, the purpose of physical life is the expansion of love and joy through the experience integration that occurs through integrating experience and through choice-making—through learning and growing—not intellectual learning, learning of the being—to choose love rather than fear. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, it's an expansion of love and joy through the growth and actualization of love and the integration of all the perspectives and situations and roles that beautifully occur on Earth—like to be you as a human and as a woman or a man and as an American or a Chinese person or as whatever—as a child or as an older person—whatever you are, whoever you are. All these forms to experience being that exactly that today and how do you respond to that? And then that experience—it becomes and is very precious to the soul. You know, the soul treasures like more than gold. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, the precious experiences it's been able to have, the perspectives it's had, the relationships you've been able to build, the love that you've been able to create and foster and share. Oh, it's more precious than gold. Love is—you could just say very simply—love is the reason.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Cheers that for a minute. It can be so beautiful. Like, I just felt that so deeply.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, when you said love is the gold, it just hits my heart.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> I know. It's sacred. It's sacred. Well, and it just—you know, when I hear you speak and others, and it's just—you know, we're not here to become a CEO. We're not here to, you know, whatever these life—these are that equal success. Like, that's not it. And so, we can if we want, but yeah, that's not it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> As part of the playground, but I just love it when I hear and feel the truth. So, thank you.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, that reminds me of a near-death experience. I've quoted this so many times, and I forget whose it was, and I'm sorry for that. But there was a near-death experience I read where this individual had their life review, and they remembered they saw an experience going down to this river as a child when their parents stopped at a rest stop, and they had a bucket of water, and their parents had asked them to bring water to the car. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when they filled the bucket of water, they noticed a dry tree out of the way, and they went over and watered the tree and then brought the rest of the bucket to their family. And they never thought anything of it, but it was such a celebrated moment of their life because it was just a loving act. There was no benefit to the person. It was just—they, you know, they, in fact, had to go out of their way a little bit to water this tree. And that is so important. You know, the small stuff is the big stuff. The small loving things—the moments when we face our fear and own our crap, the moments when we really are acting in kindness or simple joy—just like, let's say you've had a long, difficult day, and you know, there's someone playing outside. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Do you go play with them? Yeah. You know, that's the beauty. It's not about how many objects we've moved around or how much money we had. Like, this—none of that's going to—it's like accumulating gold in the World of Warcraft. It's not going to mean anything when you're outside of the game. But what is of great value is who you are. You know, because who you are laughs and endures and actually shines far brighter past the end of the physical. Who are you today? You know, that's the real question. That's the real opportunity.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> The final question—because whether I'm coaching or making content on TikTok or now in this podcast, I always want people—whoever's listening—to walk away with bits of information. And I'm sure that this entire conversation, there's so many nuggets that we could pull apart. But this final question—if you could take one piece of wisdom that you have now to your younger self—the one after between six and thirty when you were so veiled—what would that be?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Well, so that's tricky because if I revealed to my younger self what I'm now aware of, I would not have had the opportunity to do what I came to do. So, I'm not certain how to answer that. But in general, one piece of wisdom that I think is important to share is there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of. Like, we are—we actually are powerful, multi-dimensional beings having a human experience. Like, we are—it's not just a religious thing, a mythological thing, a nice—I know it may seem at times like a nice far-off dream or something. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We really are multi-dimensional beings having a physical experience, and in our true nature, there is absolutely nothing to fear. I think that's just so important to remind each other of every day here, whether we believe or we don't. Like, it's not about that; it's who we are. So, it's who we are.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, so thank you so much for being here and spending this time with me today. If someone wants to get in touch with you, how can they go about finding you?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, sure.

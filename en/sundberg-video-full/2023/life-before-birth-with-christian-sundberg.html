is Christian Sundberg. We're going to talk about his pre-life memories. It all starts right here, right now, on Guys Guys TV. You can also catch me on KCAA Radio here in Southern California, and Guys Guys Radio, my worldwide podcast, and now on UK Health Radio all weekend long. Guys Guys TV, Guys Guys Radio, thanks for your support.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Guys Guys Radio, it's our interview portion of the show. We've got a very special return guest. He's a real guy's guy, and he's here to help the world, believe it or not, and he's doing a great job of it. I got to tell you, I really enjoy talking to him. I love his work. His name is Christian Sundberg. Let me tell you a little bit about him. When he was a young boy, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. That's right, before he was born, he remembers his existence in pretty good detail. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">While that memory left him completely in his early life until his early adult life, it spontaneously returned about a dozen or so years ago when he started meditating and went through a personal awakening journey. He also began to have out-of-body experiences, and now he often speaks publicly as he seeks to remind everybody, or at least in a small part, about who we are beneath the human play that we are involved in each and every day.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Professionally, Christian has worked for 16 years plus as a project manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing projects. So he's just another guy's guy out there. He's doing the work, and he's got a message that's coming through him, and I'm so glad to be sharing that again. The name of his book is called <em>A Walk in the Physical</em>, which succinctly describes the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey. So welcome back to Guys Guys Radio, Christian Sundberg. Good to see you.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Good to see you too, sir. Thank you so much.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Encounter with the Light Being" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Encounter_with_the_Light_Being"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Encounter with the Light Being</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Sundberg recounts his pre-birth experience of meeting a radiant being who had mastered human life through wisdom and suffering." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Sundberg_recounts_his_pre-birth_experience_of_meeting_a_radiant_being_who_had_mastered_human_life_through_wisdom_and_suffering."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Sundberg recounts his pre-birth experience of meeting a radiant being who had mastered human life through wisdom and suffering.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> Well, we're going to plan to have like an organic discussion today based on our collective experience here on Earth. I think it would be helpful though to begin by providing some context for your story. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">At the beginning of your book, <em>A Walk in the Physical</em>, you describe being inspired by a great being of light who had experienced human incarnations. This being also had some information about the benefits of experiencing painful experiences in this and many lifetimes as part of our spiritual growth. You express interest in this journey that you're on right now and recalled one painful death and other lifetimes leading to your current incarnation. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So writing this book to help people expand their consciousness of the bigger picture seems to be your journey. Tell us about what I just mentioned in terms of how this all began. Where were you when this light being came to you? Tell us about that transition and the journey between that, coming to Earth, having a kind of aborted, quote-unquote, incarnation, and then coming back again, choosing your parents, doing a life plan, and all of that stuff.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Thank you, Robert. That's a very large question. First, let me just disclaim that. Okay, so we're going to use words because that's what we have on Earth, but our higher nature, our true nature, fully transcends the context of Earth and all the forms and symbols that we have to use here. Our language is based on the limitations of Earth, like linear time and discrete location. These things that we take for granted, our higher nature transcends that entirely. So it's very difficult to speak to any of this successfully, and I feel like as soon as we open our mouths and use language, we're just wrong. Like we're just immediately inaccurate. So I just have to disclaim that first.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Pre-Birth Memories and Choosing Incarnation" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Pre-Birth_Memories_and_Choosing_Incarnation"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Pre-Birth Memories and Choosing Incarnation</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Sundberg explains how reality is not location-based, how time is nonlinear, and how souls exist beyond physical constraints." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Sundberg_explains_how_reality_is_not_location-based,_how_time_is_nonlinear,_and_how_souls_exist_beyond_physical_constraints."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Sundberg explains how reality is not location-based, how time is nonlinear, and how souls exist beyond physical constraints.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so your question was, where was I? That was your initial question when I met this being of light. So first of all, as humans, we tend to think that reality is primarily comprised of places because that's how we experience Earth. We see an exterior world. It's got places in it. We go experience those places, interact with them, and then we share them with each other. And so we think that that's the primary thing. There are places in higher reality systems for sure, but the form of the context of Earth is not first. It's second to our spirit itself, our consciousness itself, which can know Earth or engage many other types of reality systems. And those reality systems can be very different.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So in the experience where I engage this being, I was traveling with a group of probably hundreds of other beings across what I would describe as a landscape of light. I don't exactly remember what we were going to do. We had some shared activity, but when I came across this being, I felt from him the quality of his nature, his essence, because in that reality system, in most other reality systems, our connectedness is felt and known. And so typically when we communicate with each other in those systems, it's not done with words like we do here on Earth. We don't have to throw symbols at each other, a very crude way of communicating. There, it's all telepathic, and you can feel the nature of the other person. This is very hard to explain or describe, but you can feel their nature, and you can share information instantaneously.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I had felt from him this incredible power and freedom and joy, and I was just in awe. And so that was what sent me down this whole path. I asked him, "How did you become this? What could you possibly have done to become this, to reach this state?" And he shared with me that he had lived a physical life. He shared with me many things, but the chief among them was that he had lived a physical life where he had suffered a physical health condition, a pain that lasted with him for years. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it's not in your question, you asked about the benefit of pain. It's not that pain is beneficial specifically. It's that the way that this being chose to relate to the experience and use the experience, and how he chose to, what state of being he chose, you can almost say, shined through this experience and allowed a refinement of who he really is that lasted past the end of that limitation. And that was very inspiring to me.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> So you were in between incarnations?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> I had never been physical yet at this point. Okay, so sequence is very difficult to speak to because on Earth we like clean, linear time. This is all happening within the one now. So even though this memory feels ridiculously ancient, like millions of years ago, it's also alive right now. I don't know how to describe that, but it's before any physical incarnation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> Okay, so and concurrently to that, you've had, do you agree that everything's happening at the same time, if you will, that time is not a straight-line continuum? Did you have, could you recall other incarnations? If so, kind of how many before where we are right now, just putting a pin on the map? Because we hear you and I are talking right now, even though the whole world, the whole universe has occurred right now also. But let's talk about that separately and us being here right now. So in that context of kind of a continuum, if you will, how many incarnations have you had, Christian?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, so you're aware of, so I'm still very much veiled, so I only have limited visibility to it, but I had an experience where I became aware of hundreds of other lives that I lived. So I know that I've lived at least hundreds. I have specific memory from a handful of them. I remember being a woman in one life, as an example. And you know, at times I've been curious about that, but when I go and reach for that, I just get this gentle, "No, you don't need to know that now." And I respect that. I respect that I'm still veiled, so I only have limited sight to my previous physical experiences.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> Now, in your decision to be incarnated in this particular incarnation, you asked for the ability to have a little bit of a peek beyond the veil, if you will. Yeah, he has to have a small amount of memory this time. I said I didn't want to forget all the way. I just wanted a small amount of memory, and they said that I could do that, but that it would make this journey more difficult because the contrast between there and here is very stark. It's very extreme, and so there is a painful homesickness that can accompany having some of that awareness. So I'm very thankful that I only have that tiny glimmer because it's not easy.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> The process of incarnating into a 3D body from a very high vibration, is there a discomfort to doing that? And if so, what is that like?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Challenge of Incarnation" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Challenge_of_Incarnation"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Challenge of Incarnation</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the transition from spiritual existence to physical form is described as an intense vibrational plunge into limitation." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_transition_from_spiritual_existence_to_physical_form_is_described_as_an_intense_vibrational_plunge_into_limitation."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the transition from spiritual existence to physical form is described as an intense vibrational plunge into limitation.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, discomfort's not a terrible word, I guess. The nature of spirit itself is extremely connected, powerful, full of love and joy and freedom. That is our true nature. And so vibrationally, the way that is experienced is being a very, very, very high vibration. Our native state is connected to all things and each other, and it's just an endless amount of joy and love and knowing. It's all-knowing. So imagine going from that place down, down, down vibrationally all the way down into the human experience. This is an extremely limited experience by contrast, just incredibly limited. It felt like an incredible plunge in vibration to go from that height all the way down into the human experience. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the human experience felt like kind of like arriving to the vacuum of space, like coming to a place where there was just no heat, no air, but also extremely dense, like being shoved inside of a tuna can, something like that, by comparison. So is that uncomfortable? Oh yes, it's very shocking. Birth is the more difficult direction, not death. Death is a release back up and out and return to the native freedom. It's a wonderful release. The process of incarnating, however, is much more abrupt, and that's the more difficult direction to travel.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> So for all of us then, you were acutely aware of a lot of this, and some, most other people aren't as aware as to how this process works. Does everybody go through a similar process as you went through, Christian, without the awareness per se, the remembering, if you will, of being kind of squashed into a human body? And is it by choice? And does everybody line up and go through a checklist in terms of, "Here's what I have to learn in this lifetime, and here's some of the possibilities for me," even though that it's going to be an infinite number of possibilities because of free will when we get to Earth? Tell us about the setup and launching into the human body for all of us that are listening.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Illusion of Separation" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Illusion_of_Separation"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Illusion of Separation</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Sundberg explains that the body is not a container for consciousness but an experience within it." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Sundberg_explains_that_the_body_is_not_a_container_for_consciousness_but_an_experience_within_it."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Sundberg explains that the body is not a container for consciousness but an experience within it.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, okay, so first of all, just a quick comment on your use of the words "into a human body." Of course, it feels like we're in a human body, but actually, it's more accurate to say that the human body is occurring within your consciousness, your spirit already. That's an important distinction because we get very convinced in the context, but the body is just sensations and thoughts and feelings occurring within the body of your awareness. And that body of awareness is the same body of awareness that you were before the physical and that you will be after. So that's just a subtle comment, but I think it's worth mentioning.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I can't speak for what anybody else has experienced in their incarnative process. I don't know for anybody else, but I do feel that it is something that we all experience, that we all choose to come. The spirit itself is sovereign, you could say. There is no greater authority. It's a drop in the ocean of all, the ocean of source. So there is no greater authority than it. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So the only way that we can be apparently bound—we're not actually bounded, but apparently bound—into the physical experience is to surrender ourselves into it, to let avail, to really surrender ourselves to a veiling process. And we do that for the purposes that the physical experience offers, which can be unique for each person. Each individual's choice may be unique. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I can't speak to anybody else, but I do feel strongly that we do all choose, at least at the deepest level, we all choose, and we do see the value of it, even though there is extreme limitation involved with accepting the human experience. It's a no joke. It's like extreme sports or something. Not everybody's going to sign up for extreme sports, but anyone who's listening today in the physical has signed up for extreme sports.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> Okay, my special guest on Guys Guys Radio, the author of <em>A Walk in the Physical: Understanding the Human Experience Within the Larger Spiritual Context</em>, Christian Sundberg. So glad you're here, Christian. So for the benefit of our listeners and for myself because I'm learning as we go also, you were given some choices. You were, I mentioned pain earlier, and I said there was a benefit, and I probably misspoke there, but it seems like we have to overcome or work through pain and also work through fear when we get to this side as part of our ascension process. Please help me articulate that better.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Fear as the Core Challenge" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Fear_as_the_Core_Challenge"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Fear as the Core Challenge</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where fear is identified as the primary obstacle of human life, shaping experiences and influencing growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_fear_is_identified_as_the_primary_obstacle_of_human_life,_shaping_experiences_and_influencing_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where fear is identified as the primary obstacle of human life, shaping experiences and influencing growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, sure. So okay, fear is the key thing to focus on. Pain is just a result. Pain is one of the many. We suffer because of the meaning we apply to our lives because of fear. Fear is the root issue, but it's not a fundamental substance or something. And I'm not just talking about the emotion of being afraid. I'm talking about our root tendency to reject reality and to try to protect ourselves at the expense of others. And we all know the feeling of fear and all the things that fear can mean. And I'm speaking of all of that when I mentioned fear. But fear is just another word for yet unevolved in this. It just means we've engaged a context that we have not yet fully integrated.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I'll give a very simple example that I mentioned in the book because I know this sounds like perhaps overly simple, but I do think it's a great metaphor. When my father in this life was a little boy, he was afraid of closets. At night, he would lay in his bed and look at his closet and imagine all the monsters in the closet. And it bothered him every night for weeks on end. Eventually, he was so sick of being afraid that he got up out of his bed, charged over to the closet, pushed his way through the clothes to the back of the wall, and sat down on the closet floor. And he waited for the monsters to eat him. And then no monsters ate him. So today, my father is no longer afraid of closets.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, I use that as a simple metaphor because the thing is, there was nothing to be afraid of. There were no monsters. And similarly, in our lives, I know there's a difference in scope. There's so much rigor available in the human experience, but when we push our way through the closet and actually go face our actual experience, our fear, when we actually feel what we feel and engage our reality fully and with openness and without rejection but with full feeling, full presence, it may feel at the moment like the monsters in the closet are going to devour us, but eventually, that fear vanishes because there was nothing ultimately to be afraid of.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Learning Through Physical Experience" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Learning_Through_Physical_Experience"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Learning Through Physical Experience</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Sundberg highlights how the human journey provides challenges for growth through contrast and experience." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Sundberg_highlights_how_the_human_journey_provides_challenges_for_growth_through_contrast_and_experience."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Sundberg highlights how the human journey provides challenges for growth through contrast and experience.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So while we come into the physical to face fear, it's not that there's just this thing called fear that we have to overcome. It's that we have to yet integrate a certain level of contrast, a certain level of context. And human experience is just an opportunity for a very rigorous and potentially challenging level of context and contrast. That's the primary thing. It's kind of like if you lay down on a weight bench and begin to lift weights, why would you ever lay down on a weight bench and push 50 pounds over you? Why would you do that? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Why would you put yourself under that stress? Well, it allows you to become stronger. You're using the counter-pressure of the weights so that you can grow in a way. The physical is a lot like that. We're using the counter-pressure of circumstance, the counter-pressure of context and contrast, and the ability to assign our own meaning onto the context and then work with it and make choices. It's all about choice-making. That is the great value of the physical, that we have that context to work with and to grow through.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> So when you comment, you're developing a contract with your team before you come over to this side, what is the elasticity in that? Let me try to go a little further with that. You have certain things that you want to accomplish, you have certain things that could happen, and then there's an infinite amount of possibilities along the way. Can you, how much of that is your free will determines that once you're incarnated? And can you change your trajectory or your timeline along the way? Let's say you've contracted to X amount of experiences in life, and you go off and you actually start living a different life, and you pass your expiration date and keep going, and it becomes a different experience. Talk to us about how that works, Christian.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Planning a Life and Free Will" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Planning_a_Life_and_Free_Will"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Planning a Life and Free Will</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where pre-birth planning involves reviewing possible life paths, but free will determines the course of experience." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_pre-birth_planning_involves_reviewing_possible_life_paths,_but_free_will_determines_the_course_of_experience."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where pre-birth planning involves reviewing possible life paths, but free will determines the course of experience.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, so that's an important element of the physical actually, is that free will can enable novel outcomes. So when we evaluate the life beforehand, what we're signing up for is a context. In my case, I had a specific intention in mind. I wanted to meet and integrate a very low vibration fear that had been very difficult for me in a past experience. And so they brought me a life that was appropriate for that primary intention. And then I reviewed that life in great detail and asked for tweaks to the context. And I could see from that side. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I reviewed millions and millions of possibilities of how the life might unfold, and the variable is free will, my choice-making, and the choice-making of all the other players in the game. But it could still be seen. You could call it a probability tree. Maybe it was a probabilistic review. It was like very likely that certain paths would occur and then less likely that other paths would occur, and it became more difficult to predict the further out it went. Something like that. I don't know. There were more branches on the tree the further out that it went.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, for example, I knew that it was likely in my early 20s that I would be crushed by a trauma, and I was very excited at that opportunity. And I knew that especially starting that moment onward, I would be engaging a vibrational distance in a certain way that I had never engaged before, that I would be going further out in the wilderness than I had ever gone. So your question was about the elasticity of that. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Once we're here, I mean, we always have free will. We come here, we signed up for the context. I'm going to have this body until this body passes. Like I can't, I can't, that's part of the context. And there are other parts of the context. There's all the rules of Earth, the rules of physics, linear time, discrete location, all those good things. But within that context, there is actually a lot more flexibility than it may appear on the surface because the physical is actually actualizing to us also in a way that is probability-based. It's not an objective, truly objective place like it appears. It's more like a probabilistic simulation that's just very dense.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Life as a Balance Between Destiny and Choice" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Life_as_a_Balance_Between_Destiny_and_Choice"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Life as a Balance Between Destiny and Choice</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where life is structured with likely events, yet individual choices create unique and unexpected outcomes." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_life_is_structured_with_likely_events,_yet_individual_choices_create_unique_and_unexpected_outcomes."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where life is structured with likely events, yet individual choices create unique and unexpected outcomes.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so once we're here, we do get to choose whatever we wish. We have free will, and if we end up choosing something different, going down a different path, okay, so be it. That is part of the game. But if we sign up for one specific outcome or one specific experience, it's just very likely that that experience will transpire, not only because the context supports it, but because there tend to be nudges throughout our lives, perhaps from even the non-physical or from our own higher self, that kind of keep us on that path to the thing that we signed up to experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> It's kind of a critical point because in one sense, people could look at it as, "Oh, I'm an actor in a play. It's already been set. The lines have been written. I just have to act it out," versus "God is experiencing itself through us, and our lives are creation. We are artists creating, and the creation we make is our lives."

Our lives are not pre-written. It's just that the system is very, very good at predicting outcome because it knows us really well. It knows you really well. It knows me really well. It knows all the rules. The server has all the data, so it can predict outcome. But it's still probabilistic because you may make a choice that is unanticipated, and that might affect someone else, and that might affect someone else, and that can have quite an effect in the physical. So we do always have free will, and it is a creative process, very much indeed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> So therefore, we can kind of skip over potential exit points, if you will. Let's say you got sick, and you got cancer, and then you changed your habits, and you changed your diet, and you changed your lifestyle, and you got better, and you kept going instead of getting worse and passing. So we have the free will to be able to impact that, correct?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, absolutely.

And that awakening process was just seen. It was like the act of the play. Like that's the act.

It's not simple. It's a major undertaking. And Earth was seen as the place to be. Earth is very exciting, very unique. Wow, Earth during the awakening is exciting.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I can't speak to any kind of specifically about the children. I do feel that the children, intuitively, I feel the children that are coming in are, at least a good portion of them, higher vibration and have that awareness. Sometimes, like I was at Walmart the other day, sometimes I feel energies from people, and there was this baby in this cart. I don't know whose baby this was, but I passed, and I felt the energy of this being for a moment, and it was just a baby, and I was like, "Oh my gosh, that mom has no idea the powerful being that's sitting in her cart right now."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> Well, that's a very important point also because I think that we've been kind of trained to not appreciate that the powers that we have as people. What do you see, Christian, as part of that happening on Earth now? What's going on Earth now? Are we in a period of ascension? Is the ascension being pushed down by certain forces? Are we going from 3D to 5D? Is there a lot of battles going on behind the scenes in terms of what's going to happen with our planet, with humanity, etc.? Disclosure, all kinds of other stuff.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, well, so like I said, I do know that the human race is going through an awakening, and that is a part of what we call the ascension process. It just means that we as individuals and as a collective and as a planet are evolving, and we are attempting an evolutionary process in a relatively short amount of time. I mean, like one human lifetime is a very short amount of time. So even if it's a few hundred years or something, that's a very short amount of time to try to process the breadth of vibrational content that we're talking about here.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Challenge of Living in a Fear-Based World" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Challenge_of_Living_in_a_Fear-Based_World"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Challenge of Living in a Fear-Based World</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where personal and collective fear is identified as the primary barrier to spiritual evolution." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_personal_and_collective_fear_is_identified_as_the_primary_barrier_to_spiritual_evolution."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where personal and collective fear is identified as the primary barrier to spiritual evolution.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Are there dark forces trying to keep it down?

There are distinctions, of course, but what's important to know is that the help that is there for us is substantial. In fact, I feel that the number of non-physical friends involved is even higher than the number of players in the game.

They may temporarily come and visit us and nudge in some way.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The higher self, I think a lot of people, including myself, kind of get tripped up as to, "Okay, is this an oversoul? Is this the consciousness part of me that isn't incarnate? I'm like a speck as part of this higher self." I don't know. I struggle sometimes with, "How do I communicate with my higher self? Is it me? Is it separate from me? Is it part of me?" Help us out with that, Christian.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, yeah, so it's tricky for us because we're in duality right now, and we are experiencing an extreme state of separation. So right now, it seems like you're just this human body, and there's no other bodies walking around, and you can't feel them. It's really isolated. But the human portion of the self is a very small subset of the total self. You might think of it like, this is a very crude metaphor, but like one folder on your hard drive. It's not that big compared to everything. It's an important folder, but it's not everything. But it's very important also to recognize that the higher self is not some other being. You're not some pawn in a chess game that your higher self is playing. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Understanding the Higher Self" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Understanding_the_Higher_Self"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Understanding the Higher Self</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the higher self is revealed as the greater aspect of one's consciousness, not a separate entity." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_higher_self_is_revealed_as_the_greater_aspect_of_one's_consciousness,_not_a_separate_entity."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the higher self is revealed as the greater aspect of one's consciousness, not a separate entity.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You are your higher self.

But when the constraints of the human experience are released, you discover that that you is much more than the limited human subset that you thought was you. I mean, that's the nature of the veiling that we experience here. It's meant to allow us to so deeply immerse into the perspective of the human character and its limitations, but that's all just a big illusion.

So karma is, I like to say, another word for just cause and effect. Okay, so you have at the foundation of all things the unconditional love of being, of source. And that unconditional love is also full of incredible wisdom. Okay, so within that's the substrate that's always true, no matter what you do, no matter what choices you make, no matter how terrible you are, unconditional love is offered. It's always there for us. It is the nature of being itself. Okay, but then subsequent to that, as we enter realities of manifest form, we are only, as a soul, so good in air quotes, at engaging a given form in a way that our true nature, our true loving nature, can shine through that form. Or only so evolved at engaging a certain form.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So karma is just a word that helps us describe the very natural cause and effect, but we could even say the divine laws of cause and effect that help us facilitate us to meet our own imperfection and to grow and heal past through it. So it's not that you have to do something. It's just that when you get to the other side and you see who you are, what it is is you see who you actually are. Like it's one thing to be not engaged in the game and to say, "Oh, I'm a very kind person." It's another thing to actually come down here when someone flicks you off on the street, and you've had a rough day, do you get angry in return? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then if you do get angry, maybe you make a gesture back, and it makes their day worse. And later in your life review, you might look back and say, "I'm a very kind person," but then you see now you actually did that action. You are the person who did that action. And it's like that with all the actions of our lives, and not even the actions, even our thoughts and our intentions. Everything is, you could say, balanced. There's a perfect cause and effect balance within it all, and it basically is just meant to facilitate us to be able to see who we are and to grow through who we really are.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So like this fear that I'm here to process in this life, I had a past experience where that fear overtook me, and I was an egoic monster. I caused a lot of damage to other people, and from the other side, I could see, "Oh man, I have a lot of fear. I got to do something about this." It wasn't that there was some great authority saying, "You that now that you screwed up, you're going to have to do this thing." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, I just, I can see who I am, and my goodness, I have a lot of fear, and I love everyone else in the game that I hurt. So I choose then to re-engage and in this life to go through a trauma in my 20s so that I could meet, I could experience great pain, and then that great fear again, so I'd have a chance. And it is a chance. It's a beautiful chance to not only re-experience it but to integrate it and overcome it and heal it. That's what karma ultimately is about. It's about choosing to have the opportunity to heal and integrate something that needs healing or integration.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> Another aspect of that, another key word is ego.

They are quite synonymous. If there is ego taking place, it means there is a fear down there. And you may notice, if you just pay attention to your own behavior, and you notice when you feel angry or you feel your own ego rise up, and you want to justify yourself in some way, "Oh well, I'm not wrong because look, I did," you will find, if you look honestly, you will find a fear down there. It might be a very scary fear. It might be a fear that's so obvious you haven't looked at it your whole life, whatever. But that ego rises up because it's just a part of us that's trying to fix the problem. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">See, now that we are in this experience of separation, the separation prompts a potentially huge amount of fear. And because so much fear is prompted, "Oh now we got to fix. No, I'm separate, and I don't have any power. How can I get power again? Oh, I'll just believe this thing that'll make me feel better," or "Oh, look, I feel valuable now because look, I'm in this important group, and that person is in that inferior group. Now that I've set up this belief inside myself, now I feel better." It's just a game. It's an illusion. It's not true satisfaction, but it's just what we do inside ourselves almost as an unconscious reaction to fear.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> Okay, Christian, so you got a little bit of a peek beyond the veil, and you came into this incarnation, if you will, aware of that, that you are going to have that experience.

It's just that most people are not really aware of what we are, and our society reflects a whole lot of layers of fear patterns and ego patterns, all the us-versus-them thinking, all the distractions. It's kind of a huge fear orgy or something. And I do wish for more for mankind, but we are growing. It's definitely not a situation of hopelessness. A lot of people are quick to point at the world and say, "Oh, see how terrible it is." I don't see that. I see a play with many very brave beings who are undertaking a very challenging constraint set and doing their best to grow through it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> No, that's a great point, something we should all keep in mind. What is the best advice you can give our audience out there in terms of how to deal with the reality that we're living in and the collective beliefs and kind of dysfunction that you've seen and that a lot of us who are waking up are experiencing? Because there seems to be, in my opinion, a bifurcation in terms of some people are going to the left, and some are going to the right, and I don't mean politically. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, some people are asleep, and they have chosen and are choosing on a regular basis to stay asleep, and there are other people who are saying they're waking up and waking up faster and faster. And I don't know how those two, is it going to be different timelines? Is it a dimensional thing? How do, what's your advice for people who are on a trying to follow a good path and really ascend and do the right thing when you have such a dysfunctional place that we're playing in?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, so I would first comment that I don't think we should start the approach to this or the idea with the idea that we're in a dysfunctional place. Even that is putting a meaning onto it. The only thing that we have, and I know this is much bigger than it sounds, but it actually helps us cope. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Power of Choosing Love Over Fear" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Power_of_Choosing_Love_Over_Fear"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Power of Choosing Love Over Fear</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where making choices based on love rather than fear is emphasized as the key to navigating life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_making_choices_based_on_love_rather_than_fear_is_emphasized_as_the_key_to_navigating_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where making choices based on love rather than fear is emphasized as the key to navigating life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The only thing we have to deal with is our own lives.

We just, it helps us to be attentive to this, to notice the quality of our own intention in all of our choice-making in our lives. So what I mean is, are we wielding an intention that is based in love or fear? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And are we then making choices that are love-based, or is there some ego pattern and fear that is really at the root of this decision?

That's a very empowering message.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> I agree 100%. If you want to change the world, you got to change yourself. And one of the ways you kind of reached a tipping point is through meditation. Talk to us about your beliefs about meditation, how you do it, how long you've been doing it, how did you start doing it, the type of meditations you do, etc.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, sure. So I very much recommend meditation. I'll just start off by saying that. It's far more valuable than it appears on the surface. It's kind of like you may do it for a while and not even recognize, and then all of a sudden, there's a great treasure that you haven't even known was there always. So as for the type of meditation, so 12 years ago or so, I started meditating because Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer whose work I was reading, recommended it. He said, "Just go find out. Go investigate your own consciousness in an objective way. Don't make up any stories. This is not a new belief system thing. Just go look at your own consciousness, what you are when not engaged in thinking."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And at first, I started with a meditation exercise he recommends. I think it's in chapter 23 of his book, and it's synonymous with a transcendental meditation exercise and focusing on a neutral object. And after a couple of sessions of doing that, first I just felt some relief because I was constantly lost in stressful thinking. So I continued to do it because it was relieving and also because Tom said, "Attempt it for three months every day without any expectation of result." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, I did that, and after about six weeks or maybe eight weeks, I'm not sure exactly, but I had my first non-physical experience spontaneously at night. And it was so eye-opening that I was like, "There is something actually going on here. I've got to continue down this path to investigate." And then the pre-birth memory just kind of returned later. It was just, once I was in that state of awareness, it was just there. It wasn't like a big epiphany or something amazing. So I very much recommend meditation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> Okay, last question. Have you met, Christian, other people who have had this similar experience that you've had in terms of being aware of what happened to them before being incarnated? The reason one of the reasons I asked you is you have a very big following, and I guess they're resonating not just with your message of unconditional love but also with the process that has brought you right here, right now.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, well, I've met probably at least 40 or so other people who have pre-birth memory. And I even had one person reach out to me and say, "So there's a portion of my story that I shared about practicing surrendering to the veil in what I call the veil acceptance simulator." Just a, I don't know what to call it, but after I described this, I had a woman reach out to me and say, "I remember that exact place, and it's exactly like you described." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And she said that she pulled over to the side of the road because she's noted her whole life, and she never heard anybody say it. You know, those kind of validating comments are very interesting to me. But what's more important is that we are opening the door a crack and saying it's okay to actually consider the possibility of this because as we do that, there's a vibrational change happening right now. And as we participate in that and our vibration raises, it's going to be natural for us to have interaction with the higher, deeper portions of our self. And that's happening for many people all over the world.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Increasing Openness to Spiritual Awareness" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Increasing_Openness_to_Spiritual_Awareness"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Increasing Openness to Spiritual Awareness</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where a growing number of people are awakening to spiritual truths and seeking connection." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_a_growing_number_of_people_are_awakening_to_spiritual_truths_and_seeking_connection."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where a growing number of people are awakening to spiritual truths and seeking connection.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So many people don't feel open to talk about it. A lot of people reach out to me, and they just want to share their experience, and I'm happy to hear because a lot of people do have similar experiences, and they are real. Like if you have an out-of-body experience, and it's a fully lucid OBE, there is no doubt. It's not like, "Oh, this is a dream or something." I mean, it's so real. It's at least as lucid and real as a waking Earth experience. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when you come back from that, how do you not take that into consideration? I mean, like, you, it has to impact you. And many people experience that too. And now we're all kind of coming together, and I love that the dialogue is becoming more open. That is a wonderful, beautiful thing. I just can't live in secrecy of it. I have to share this kind of thing because it's so important to who we are. The real nature of who we are is beyond all fear. We have nothing to fear, and fear is the primary issue we're dealing with.

And we should love one another, and we should choose love over choosing fear, which is something that we face, each one of us faces it numerous times every day.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> Absolutely. So absolutely, Christian Sundberg, I'm so glad we got connected. I'm so glad you came back on the show. I hope we reach so many people with your message. Keep doing the work you're doing. Tell everybody out there where they could find out more about you. The name of the book again is <em>A Walk in the Physical: Understanding the Human Experience Within the Larger Spiritual Context</em>. It's a great book. You don't have to read it from page one to 300. You can jump around, and it's got a lot of good stuff there. I won't go into all of it, but check it out. Tell us where your website is, Christian.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg:</strong> Yeah, sure. My website is awalkinthephysical.com, so <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://www.awalkinthephysical.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://www.awalkinthephysical.com." target="_blank">www.awalkinthephysical.com.</a> The book is available for free on that website. It's the third link down on the book page. It's not about money. I just would like to get the information out there. The book is also available on Amazon and Audible, and I'm happy to try to interact by email to anybody who'd like to reach out, but I do sometimes get swamped, so I apologize if I don't respond.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Robert Manning:</strong> Yeah, well, great to see you again, Christian.

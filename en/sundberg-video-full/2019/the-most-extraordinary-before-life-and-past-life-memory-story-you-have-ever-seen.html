I am Mira Kelley, and I'm so thrilled to introduce you to Christian Sundberg. Today, we are going to have such a thrilling, exciting conversation. When I came across Christian's story, all I could think of right away was that I needed to share this with you. I needed to learn more. We need to know about this.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We were introduced by a mutual acquaintance who reached out to me—a man based in Italy looking to put together a book on the experiences of people who have lost children, to bring comfort to mothers. He was looking to interview me to hear my thoughts on the subject to include that in his book. In our conversation, I got to learn about you, Christian. So, hello and welcome.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Thank you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: It's not her. Thank you. The owner is absolutely ours. As I just mentioned, I think this is very important for people to hear, and so I really appreciate what you're doing. Thank you very much.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Thank you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: What I really loved about your story right away was what this man shared with me—that you remember your experience, your existence before birth here on Earth. I was so intrigued by that. I was like, "Oh my God, we have to talk to him." So, I would love to know more. Please take us right in.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Nature of Pre-Birth Memory**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Nature_of_Pre-Birth_Memory**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Nature of Pre-Birth Memory</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian describes the challenge of articulating pre-birth experiences beyond language, their simultaneous nature, and their return through meditation at age 30." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_describes_the_challenge_of_articulating_pre-birth_experiences_beyond_language,_their_simultaneous_nature,_and_their_return_through_meditation_at_age_30."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian describes the challenge of articulating pre-birth experiences beyond language, their simultaneous nature, and their return through meditation at age 30.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Sure. Well, it's kind of a big story, and it's too hard to articulate. In fact, most of it is just beyond language. I find there's a really hard time trying to put words on any of this because words are of our local world. They're forms, symbols, and where we come from transcends all the symbols of Earth. It's bigger than anything we can put words to. But anyway, that disclaimer being said, I guess I'll try to go in order. But even order is a little bit fuzzy here because these experiences do have a sequence, but they also simultaneously kind of are happening at once. Like, even right now, I feel like these experiences are not so much in the past; they're kind of now, even though some were before others. So, I don't know how to really articulate that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: You're talking to the right people because my audience has already heard me talk about simultaneous time. So, everybody, I imagine, is integrated. Hey, we're with you. That's great.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Yeah. So, my earliest memory—first of all, the memory that I have is connected with my journey here. The memory that I have—so, I had memory when I was a child in this life, and I assumed everybody did for a while. Then, eventually, when I got to be about seven or so years old, I had forgotten it. It returned at about the age of thirty. I'm 38 right now. It returned after I had gone to a certain path of spiritual awakening and meditation. As the memory has returned to me, it's come in a way that is helpful for my purpose. So, there are aspects of my memory which are blocked off still, and that's okay with me now. I respect the larger purposes at work here.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Inspiration from a Being of Light**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Inspiration_from_a_Being_of_Light**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Inspiration from a Being of Light</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian recalls being inspired by a joyful, refined being who had faced physical challenges, prompting his own desire to incarnate and grow." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_recalls_being_inspired_by_a_joyful,_refined_being_who_had_faced_physical_challenges,_prompting_his_own_desire_to_incarnate_and_grow."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian recalls being inspired by a joyful, refined being who had faced physical challenges, prompting his own desire to incarnate and grow.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I do remember a very long time ago—and some of this might sound strange—but I remember a very long time ago, before I was ever physical, before I had any physical incarnation at all, being inspired by a being that I had come across who had been physical, who had had physical experiences as some physical being. It doesn't matter what he was. I just know that I came across this being, and I remember being overwhelmed and inspired by the quality of his essence, his nature. It was so beautiful and full of light and joy and power.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember asking him—and again, these aren't words; it's all telepathic. There are thoughts shared, information—but I asked, "My goodness, like, look at what you've become. How did you do this? What did you possibly do to be this? And are you filled with as much joy as it looks like you're filled with?" And he said, "Yes, I am." And he shared with me this depth of quality of being that he had, and I was absolutely inspired.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I asked him how he had done it, and he showed me that he had lived. He had showed me several things, but one primary experience he had had was that he had been physical and had had a chronic health problem—some kind of pain or sickness that lasted for many years. He had to deal with that, and it boiled down to how he chose to meet that experience. The quality with which he met that experience allowed a certain refinement of his being, I guess that's the only way I can describe it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was so inspired. I said, "Oh, and you bet I want to do that. I am gonna do that." And I was so—you know, just—I was really inspired. And he kind of said, "Yeah, that's kind of what they all say," brushing me off in a playful way. And I said, "No, I'm serious. I want to do that." And so, well, "Go talk to your guides."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I went. I found my guides, and I explained. And then—I don't remember immediately after that, but I know that I lived many times after that.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Power of Intent**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Power_of_Intent**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Power of Intent</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian and Mira discuss how meeting life’s challenges with willingness and love, as exemplified by the being, offers hope and opportunity for eternal growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_and_Mira_discuss_how_meeting_life’s_challenges_with_willingness_and_love,_as_exemplified_by_the_being,_offers_hope_and_opportunity_for_eternal_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian and Mira discuss how meeting life’s challenges with willingness and love, as exemplified by the being, offers hope and opportunity for eternal growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: I have to talk to you right here. So sorry to interrupt. I just have to ask a question and comment. What you just said about this being having had this chronic illness—you just gave so much hope to so many people who have chronic conditions, right? We're dealing with a serious illness because, you know, you just showed them the bigger purpose of it, right? A different approach—how it can be taken and seen rather than, "My body is a victim, and I'm victimized by needing to go do something," instead of the path to that greater spiritual growth and awakening, right?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: For you tonight, I want to say that growth and awakening is permanent. It's eternal. And so, the temporary experience of illness or chronic distress or whatever is worth the price to the bold spirit who wishes to grow. And to us who are here, we resist. You know, where you're like, "I don't like this." Oh yeah, we fight it. The deeper parts of us know that we are eternal. We don't—we have nothing ultimately to fear. And we know that the experience may seem very real and unrelenting when we're here. It feels unrelenting. You know, I'm here. I'm a human right now. I know. But it's not. It's just a very deep dream.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: Where were you able to gather what was that quality that this being met his illness with? Because you said it was a particular way. So, we're definitely not talking about begrudgingly and regretfully. It was something different. What was the impression that was left in you?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: That's a really good question. The best way I can put it is willingness and openness. And there are no words for this. I think it's more like a quality of love that he brought even into that pain. And it was a quality of his intent—a term I like to use, "quality of intent," that comes from the physicist and consciousness explorer Tom Campbell. It's a beautiful term. This being had a quality of intent when he met his experience, and it was not easy.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: We all have that opportunity. I mean, that's the thing. The thing that inspires me—the thing about your message that's so inspiring—is that we don't have to move mountains in this life. We just have to meet our experience. And it's the small things that have the most power. It's choosing love over fear. It's choosing willingness over resistance, even in small moments. There's so much power there. And as humans who are consumed by human drama, we forget that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: It's just the opportunity that is available to us as humans is amazing. And if there's one message I could just—I just hope to share as someone who remembers—this is an opportunity. In fact, being human is like one of the most precious gifts you could possibly be given.

So, I lived many lives, and then I went back and found him later. And I said, "I'm not all the way there yet, but see, I've done some of this." And I shared with him, and he was encouraging. But I knew I wasn't done yet.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So now—okay, so now I'm going to jump a bit because I don't know exactly how all the sequence happens here. But I remember—and this is going to sound very strange, and I would only share this with this kind of groovy audience—I honestly remember the moment that the universe—our universe—was to be created, that the intention was being issued forth from Source and from all of us. We were all involved to take this to like the next level and to have this next level rigorous, deep experience of being physical.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't remember being around when the universe was created. I wasn't there at the very beginning. I was doing something else. I don't know what I was doing, but I was doing something. But I remember coming early when the galaxies were young, and there were just stars. And I remember soaring amongst the stars and being filled with so much excitement. It's all the excitement of the opportunity to play in this game. I can't stress enough how exciting it is to the spirit to have the opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, it was like, "Wow, we actually get to be these things—these people, these creatures, whatever we're gonna be. We actually get to be that and experience that." And it's so exciting because we know, from that perspective, what an opportunity that is for us to integrate experience and to expand and to grow and to express our creative natures and to be and to express love and to grow in love. It's just a huge opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I knew even then, like, "Wow, this is—oh, this is a hard level." You know, not an easy level—a hard level game room or something. You know, again, the words just aren't there. But anyway, so I remember that. And then I had some other experiences.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Facing an Ancient Fear**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Facing_an_Ancient_Fear**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Facing an Ancient Fear</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian recounts planning to face a past-life fear of agony and pride, viewing it as a self-chosen opportunity for profound expansion, not karmic punishment." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_recounts_planning_to_face_a_past-life_fear_of_agony_and_pride,_viewing_it_as_a_self-chosen_opportunity_for_profound_expansion,_not_karmic_punishment."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian recounts planning to face a past-life fear of agony and pride, viewing it as a self-chosen opportunity for profound expansion, not karmic punishment.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then the majority of my memory is regarding a time somewhat immediately preceding this life, where I had taken a long break because I just decided I was taking a long break. So, I frolicked for a long time in this realm of gold and light, just having fun and joy and just like having a very long weekend that I just was reluctant to give up.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember—I really wanted to—okay, so I want to get back in the game because there was a very old fear that had bested me in a past experience, so to speak. And so, I remember this guide coming to me relatively often and asking, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready yet? Are you ready yet?" And putting him off for a while and eventually saying, "Okay, I'm ready."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then going over with him, kind of like my state—what I had done, what I had been, who I was. And it was very obvious the thing that I needed to work on. I had many qualities, but there was a great weakness, and it had bested me in a previous experience. And the best way I can put it is that it was a fear. And this fear in a past life had caused me to die an agonizing death. I died painfully.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: Here is something to the effect of inability to escape agony or pain, mixed with a being too proud to suffer, I guess is the only way I can put it. It's a certain vibration. And this vibration had—in that life, I was not a nice person. And I caused a lot of damage to others and to myself. And I really yearned to face that again and to integrate it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I wanted to do that not because I had to or something, but because I knew—this is hard to explain, but it's very important—I knew that the opportunity to go such a distance away from Source and integrate that distance—if I could do that, the power expansion would be unfathomably beautiful and powerful and wonderful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, I remember asking the guide—  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: I have to interrupt again because what you just said is profound. You just gave the answer—the example, I should say—to what I've been teaching. Karma is not anything other than the self-imposed desire to do better. It's not judgment. It's not that you've been a bad person and now you have to suffer. It's the desire for growth and balancing out. And you said it so beautifully. Thank you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Thank you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: That's why it's so great to hear you say it because I feel like I live in a world where many—so many have forgotten. And it's important that we remind each other.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Anyway, it's like you said. It's not that there's a requirement. It's that we see who we are. We see in a life review. You see who you actually were. There's not a judgment needed because you know exactly who you were. You know if you were loving or fearful or how you affected others. There's no hiding.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, I had not been nice in this life. I had caused many others to suffer. So, I wanted to re-engage this fear. And I wanted to do it, but I thought, "Is it even possible?" I mean, I thought, "This fear is one of the greatest fears I've ever beheld." And I asked my guide, "Has it ever been done in all of creation? Has any other being ever done this?" And I was told, "Yes, and you have all of eternity to do so. You call time. There's no hurry."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I thought very confidently, "Well, if it can be done, I can do it." I just knew that. I just knew if it's possible within all that is, I won't do it. So, they brought me into life, and it was perfect for this purpose. And I reviewed it, and I accepted it. And I accepted the veil, which is very—the forgetfulness.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Veil’s First Rejection**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Veil’s_First_Rejection**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Veil’s First Rejection</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian describes accepting the veil, panicking, rejecting it by causing a miscarriage, and reflecting on the sorrow and wasted opportunity it caused." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_describes_accepting_the_veil,_panicking,_rejecting_it_by_causing_a_miscarriage,_and_reflecting_on_the_sorrow_and_wasted_opportunity_it_caused."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian describes accepting the veil, panicking, rejecting it by causing a miscarriage, and reflecting on the sorrow and wasted opportunity it caused.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and that is the thing I remember the most about all of this—the process of accepting the veil. And I feel like even right now, I'm looking right at it. I can't see through it, but it's like looking at one of those—I don't know—like in the cop shows, there's like a pane of glass where you can see one way, but you can't see the other. I feel like I'm standing right on the other side of the glass. I know they can see me, and I know the glass is there even though I can't see it, and I can feel it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But anyway, so I accepted the veil in this life. And the vibration—the vibrational drama—was so significant and so low that I was instantly completely terrified within moments. I wasn't even born yet. I was just full of the darkness and the separation and the lack of knowledge.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because when the veil comes over you, it's like all of a sudden, you feel like you're not the whole anymore. You're not all that is. Now, you're separate. Now, you're in the dark. Now, you know nothing. And it could be terrifying. In this particular life, I don't get the sense that different lives have different vibrational places, and this one was quite low.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I panicked immediately. And this is very sad, but I mustered my might, and I smoked the veil. I rejected it, and I jumped back out because I killed the fetus. I killed the unborn child. And I had a life review for my very, very short life—like, I don't know, some very short amount of time.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I had all these beautiful intentions going in. I really—I recited so much respect for the other players in the game—all of us, all my fellow spirits who were brave enough to be human. Man, I wanted to do that. I just so respected them. But when I was on the other side, I mainly saw that my fear had caused a miscarriage, and the poor mother was brought great sorrow. And not only her, but I knew then hundreds of other people whose lives had been made more difficult because of my fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: Five seconds in, you know, just right at the start.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: And I knew everything was okay because, on the other side, I mean, I feel sorrow now even as I think about it, but it's full of joy too because there's nothing wrong.

And I remember reviewing this vast flowchart—it's the best way I can describe it—of millions and millions of possibilities of how things would go over time. I remember even then thinking about it in numerical terms of age, yearly ages. And I remember reviewing qualities of my parents and how important they would be in fulfilling my mission.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I knew that my father would instill confidence in me, and that confidence would be paramount to me doing this—beyond being able to meet this fear. And I knew that I should be male because being a man would give me a certain kind of focus and edge that I needed to meet the fear. And I knew—and I asked—I asked a lot of things. I said, "I want to be intelligent." Again, they knew that I had been intelligent in other lives, and they said, "Yes, you can do that."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I said, "You know, I don't want to forget everything this time. I want to remember a small amount—just enough." And they said, "You can do that, but it will make it even more difficult." And I knew why. I could sense because the contrast would be even greater. And I'm here to tell you, it has made this life more challenging because I miss home.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's a wonderful—I mean, this whole experience is wonderful, but I miss that state of being. And I'm not going to forsake this opportunity. I've spent a very long time in this life meeting it fully, and I intend to do so. But I'm just saying that I knew at the time that it would be hard to have some memory. And I knew that it was almost necessary to forget because the constraints of being human are so high, and the restriction of not remembering who you are is so great that it can be incredibly painful to remember who you are and still be here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In fact, not only can it be painful, but it's also just not feasible because you can't really go to work in the morning if you know that you're the Sun.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: So, anyway, I remember asking, and they said, "Yes." But the thing is, I knew that even that difficulty—even that contrast—was an opportunity for growth. And I knew that I was serving not only myself but I was serving the whole by agreeing to do that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I reviewed many, many avenues. And I knew that I would have certain opportunities. And I knew that a trauma would likely follow me in my 20s that would crush me and basically give me the opportunity to reinstate fear. And it did happen. And I had post-traumatic stress for about eight or so years, and it was quite serious. And I am going through counseling for some number of years, and I also went through my spiritual awakening process.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I've met that fear to a very large extent. So, I am here doing exactly what I came to do. And as I've done that, my memory has naturally returned as it is helpful for me—only and only really as it is helpful. But it is helpful because I'm inspired by my own intention.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Anyway, so I planned this all out. And I don't remember actually saying yes.

How was it different?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: This current life was not as good as the last one in terms of being optimal for my purpose because my spirit has certain qualities that have to interface with the life. I'm strong in certain ways, and the life has to be able to work with that. And I'm weak in certain ways. The first life was like all around—I don't know if you imagine a score sheet or something, and all the numbers were high. You know, it was just really appropriate.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: So, go ahead. What was the reason the second life isn't that optimal? Why can't it be a ten-ten-ten everywhere for that?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Like, I can't say it in terms of what circumstance or constraint is different specifically, but I can say that from the spiritual perspective, it's known that Earth only has so much. Earth is limited. So, like, there's only so many people. At any given time, there's only so many choices. There's only so many—  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: It totally makes sense. Yes, like you said, the flowchart needs to interact with everybody else's flowchart.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Yeah. Oh, actually, it's not—yeah, no, this constraint set was more about my body and my parents and the life context. That was what made it appropriate or not. And the body was important. I knew that this body had a limitation that other bodies do not. And I knew that other spirits would pass it up. They would not necessarily choose to be this human.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I have since studied nutrigenomics and studied how my DNA influences how my brain chemistry works and how I eat and my diet and things like that. And I have discovered that I have some rather unusual genetic makeup, and I've dealt with health challenges as a result. But I knew that beforehand.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What I'm saying is that I knew that it would make things difficult in a way that was important because it would pressure my ego or something. It would provide a weight on my day-to-day experience that I needed to feel, I guess, is the best way I can put it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, the second set of circumstances was very good. It just wasn't as efficient as the first one would have been. But it was still good. It was still very—you know, good. If I put a grade on it, maybe the first was 99%, and this was 87%. Yeah, I don't know.

So, I remember then them telling me—I remember waiting. Oh, there's an important part I should mention. So, I knew that I was going to have to accept the veil again, and I didn't want to. I didn't want to fail again. So, I practiced in something like a veil acceptance simulator, I guess is what you could call it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There's like a room where you go, and a mock veil comes over you, and you practice surrendering to it. And it just basically scares you and makes you like you're ready to do that dive—you know, that jump. And I remember practicing that. And the real veil is more difficult than the simulator.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember because when it was time for the real thing, I was so pumped. I was so excited. I had all my energy gathered. It's like before the life, you're so excited, and you just gather all this energy, and you're so ready to go on this new adventure. So, I was ready.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember my guide coming to me and suddenly very abruptly—I remember this getting my attention—like, "Go now." Like, very—almost rude, but not rude because the spirit is so—kind of freeing. Not off in la-la land, but so free that, like, you have to all of a sudden—now you're on Earth time, buddy. You got to go now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, I was like, "Okay, okay, now." And I remember this process where these beings—who I can only describe as technicians or tinkerers—help apply the veil to you. And I remember them asking me one last time, "Are you sure you want to do this? Because once you say yes, you're in. Once you're strapped in, you're in for the ride."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I said, "Yes." And I remember the veil coming over me and just truly focusing on basically just not fighting it—basically just letting it do its will. Like, letting go and just letting time pass so the veil could get a grip on me, and I could be wrapped in it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that plummet—I remember very well the plummet of having my knowing cut off and having my connectedness disappear and feeling this—I can only describe it as like going into a vacuum. Like, the vacuum of space. No, there's just no air there. There's just no heat. There's no air. You just suddenly descend from perfect connectedness and life and vibrance and kinetic knowledge to just feeling alone and dark and cut off.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was terrifying. It was terrifying again. But I remember holding on and just like holding on and holding on and holding on. And then I remember sending a signal back through this little window—did it take back to the technicians—and getting one message back through, "Yes."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that little window, by the way, I feel is part of them. That's not really a window. It's part of why I remember. So, anyway, I held on for as long as I could, and they said, "Yes." And the veil took.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then I witnessed—so then I was in the womb, and I was there for a while. And eventually, I just decided, "You know what? I'm not doing this. This is so low vibration. This is so dark. I am NOT doing this." So, once again, I began to muster my might to fight my way out. I was not going to have it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then the most beautiful thing happened. The only way I can put it is that the Spirit of God came to me—the Great Spirit of God. And it showed me all the galaxies and all the stars, and I knew that they were me, and I was them. And it said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's very emotional because I can't tell you how personal that feeling is—what we are. You know, we are that love. And the Spirit reminded me of that, and it called me—you know, it called me enough that I could let go and just surrender to this simple experience of being in the womb.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And my next memory is the shock of being born. And I have one visual image memory from the day I was born—just one. It was of the room after they pulled me out. And later in my life, I drew the room for my mother, and she just identified, "You were here. The doctor was here. Here was the window. Here was the heating grate." And I was right. Apparently, I mean, I knew I would be, but I just remember that one image.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And being like, "I remember being like, 'What is this place? Where am I? This is so—who are these beings who are taking care of me? Like, what is going on?'" I remember there was no context yet. It was just sense data. It was just shock and cold and white and sound and people touching me, and someone is cutting my body, and you know, like, there's things going on.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, like, I don't know. It was very shocking. And then what happened was a few weeks after that, as an infant, I almost died. In fact, this is a separate story, but I turned purple because I had some kind of a respiratory infection, and I wasn't breathing. And they rushed me to the hospital, and my father at the time sensed—he was working on a house. He was doing some kind of remodeling, and he just suddenly put down his work and said, "I don't know how I know, but Christian is in the hospital, and I need to go right now."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This was before the day of cell phones, and he went to the hospital, and they baptized me in the hospital because I was going to die. But anyway, so I didn't die. I made it. I don't remember that event. I only remember that first shock of being born. I remember some stress near that period that I don't remember that time.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But then, as I got older, I mean, I used to recall these memories, and I used to kind of cheat a little bit. I would kind of draw up on the flowchart memory and try to see what was going to happen. You know, like, I just—it was like peeking—you know, like, behind a veil or something and just going to happen tomorrow. You know, what? Just 'cause I was a kid. You're curious. You know, I was like, "Well, huh, that's weird. Well, what's going to happen when this person's going to come?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And eventually, I think it was some—it started getting cut off for me, especially around age five. It was like I was not allowed to cheat anymore. No way. I was getting thicker and thicker as I became more and more focused on the physical.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Understanding the Purpose of Human Incarnation**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Understanding_the_Purpose_of_Human_Incarnation**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Understanding the Purpose of Human Incarnation</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian comes to terms with the idea that most humans do not remember their spiritual origins." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_comes_to_terms_with_the_idea_that_most_humans_do_not_remember_their_spiritual_origins."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian comes to terms with the idea that most humans do not remember their spiritual origins.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But anyway, as a kid, I remember expecting that everybody knew that we weren't from here. I mean, everybody must know that this is just a game. You know, this is like this to come place. We come, and we're having a neat experience. And I assumed some things from the other reality were true here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For instance, I assumed that people could feel each other's emotions, which is very normal in other reality systems but not normal on Earth. And I remember one day as a little kid—I don't know how old, but I was young enough where I had only recently learned how to walk—and I remember being in a diaper, and I remember standing at this couch, and my parents had a neighbor friend over.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember there was this music on, and I told the neighbor, "Watch me dance." And I remember dancing to this funky music on the record player and shaking my little tush and feeling funky. And the woman walked away unimpressed, and I was like, "She can't feel what I'm feeling." And when I realized that, I was just dumbfounded. I was like, "Where the heck am I? What place is this that we can't feel each other's emotions? What is going on?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It made no sense to me. It was like—and I had other assumptions. You know, just things like I assumed that the higher someone was in society, the more loving and wise they were because, in other reality systems, the more powerful beings of love and wisdom just naturally have positions of leadership or power. You know, guides—they're loving and wise.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It turned out not to be exceptionally true, but anyway, that list of the memories ended up kind of fading, as I said. And eventually, I didn't remember that at all. And when this began to return to me, it was like, "Oh my gosh, how did I ever forget that? How did I ever forget that?" You know, like, "I can't believe I forgot that. I mean, it's the most natural thing in the world to remember, but I forgot."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know how? I know it's because of the veil. It's very thick. And the more we focus on the physical content and especially our labels of the physical content, the deeper the physical experience becomes. You know, it's not that the physical experience is bad. It's just thick and rigorous, and it's consistent. It gives us an opportunity to be challenged and to make the two-wheeled intent to make choices that are either love-based or fear-based.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Accepting the Limits of Memory**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Accepting_the_Limits_of_Memory**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Accepting the Limits of Memory</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian acknowledges that remembering too much would distract from the purpose of human experience." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_acknowledges_that_remembering_too_much_would_distract_from_the_purpose_of_human_experience."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian acknowledges that remembering too much would distract from the purpose of human experience.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I think that's about—that's about a summary. There's some other smaller things, but I think that really the messages of it—and there are other aspects, other places that sometimes will come to me, and I try to go there, and I just sense, "No, you don't need to go there," because there's something of an entertainment aspect that I think is not necessary.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, as entertaining to think, "Oh wow, you know, I lived these other lives." Like, I know for instance, one time after I was meditating, I just suddenly became spontaneously aware that I had lived hundreds of other lives. I just saw these spheres, and I knew they were me, and I had this deep, profound sense that the me that feels like me to me was those other people.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not like I always thought, "If reincarnation is real, it must be some other people, and I'm them." No, it was me exactly. Hello, everybody experience. Yeah, it's definitely me. And so, it's like I remember just brief snippets. Like, I remember being a woman who gave birth, and it was terribly painful, and having trauma that was like a fear I experienced in this life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And having to give birth the second time and being terrified of having to give birth because of the pain of giving birth. And this was in a time when there was not—and I remember being in very simple surroundings. But anyway, so those things are entertaining, but they're not really pertinent. I mean, I'm not—why I'm here—we don't come here just for that. We come here to be human.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I respect—I guess I'm just saying I respect the fact that I don't remember more. And when I am curious, I respect when my guides—who I might not commonly consciously remember—I know they're there. I can feel them. But when they kind of give me the gentle "No," I'm okay with that. Like, I'm totally okay with that.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Spiritual Exploration Beyond the Physical Realm**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Spiritual_Exploration_Beyond_the_Physical_Realm**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Spiritual Exploration Beyond the Physical Realm</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian describes out-of-body experiences and how they confirm the existence of other realities." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_describes_out-of-body_experiences_and_how_they_confirm_the_existence_of_other_realities."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian describes out-of-body experiences and how they confirm the existence of other realities.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I've had out-of-body experiences. That's the other thing. And I've had some very eye-opening out-of-body experiences, and they're very wonderful and just so full of joy and fun. They're not why I'm here either. We're here to use this experience fully for everything that it can be and not get distracted.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I should like to add another reason the veil is there. It helps us not get distracted.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: Right, right. And so, now that you had this experience in your 20s, and you dealt with the PTSD after it, and that brought about the spiritual awakening within you, and now you have the awareness of, "I actually have overcome this fear. I've worked through it. I can say that I'm on the other side of this river I've been crossing. I'm not all the way on the other side of it. I'm very—I've healed a great deal of it, and I have the sense that if I even if I were to be finished with this life right now, I've already accomplished a very important step."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Mm-hmm. I just know that that's the thing. My ego would like this to be quick and easy and just get it done. You know, like, "Oh, I have a task. I have an affinity to have this task of overcoming this fear. Let's just finish that task." That's how the human mind thinks.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I've come to find that the soul works in its own time, and it's very important to let time do its work on us. And so, what I'm letting happen is I'm letting—I'm being fully human. That's the hardest thing. Before, I didn't even realize I had so much fear. But for the first 30 years of my life, I didn't even allow myself to be fully present for simple things. I was always resisting.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And now, I am not doing that. I am here. I am present even with simple sensations. I'm a very sensitive person. I sense energy. I'm very sensitive to foods and medicines and environments. Ask my very patient wife. She's very patient with my sensitivities. But it's so—it's hard.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that sensitivity actually goes hand in hand with the awareness that I asked to have because I knew it would mean I'd have to be more sensitive. And that sensitivity is an opportunity, even though it's hard sometimes. I'm committing day to day—just day to day—to be fully present with whatever I'm feeling and whenever I'm seeing and whomever I am.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I am no longer ashamed. I'm no longer afraid to be somebody or to fail in some way. I'm not afraid to feel pain. I've felt a lot of pain in this life and actually come close to death a few times—at least twice in my life. But I work to allow that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And as you do that, it's funny because we resist our suffering so much, but ironically, the way past the suffering is often through the suffering—not around it, not solving it. You can't have the—I don't mean to overgeneralize, but you can't have the intention to solve the suffering from outside of it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You need to realize that the universe is built from a place of love. It's here for a purpose of love. It's here from a purpose of love and built from wisdom. So, we can let—we can work with it. We can work with that human experience as it comes to us, even in the small ways. And there's so much power available there.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And people don't realize how powerful they are day to day. It's a hopeful message. And actually, it's so perfect for what I would love to have you say to us. If there is a message you want to give to people, if there's something you want to bring from this story that everybody—each and every one of us—applies in that our lives will not be—  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: I think the most important message is that you—whoever you are listening today—are loved. You are deeply, deeply loved. You are so loved. And if you could feel even a tiny bit of it, you would be brought to your knees and cry for joy. You are loved.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So many of us don't even dare to believe that we're worthy of it, let alone think it's a real thing. I mean, here on Earth, we have some very harsh experiences that can happen here, and I understand that that's very hard and rigorous many times. But the love is always there, even when those experiences are happening. It's like—greater on the other side. It's closer to us than our own breath.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I guess that's the most important thing I could possibly say is: You are loved. You are loved. You are loved. You are an immortal spirit. You're not going to die. There's no such thing as death. There is only the experience of being human. And whoever you are here listening today, you are you. You're not a human. You're you. And the you is having the experience of being a human.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: How would you suggest we deal with this forgetfulness and with this veil? Because you have the ability to remember, but most of us don't, and we're looking for that sense of remembering so we feel that love—that connection with all that is. How do you suggest we deal with it?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: I think it's so important that we surrender to the present moment because the present moment is not our enemy. And the veil, even though it is obscured so much, is not our enemy either. Our goal is not to find our way out. You know, there's so many people just want to get out.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm here to tell you, having the opportunity to be human is an absolutely precious, amazing opportunity and a gift. It's like being handed the most precious gift in the universe, and here you are. So, all you have to do is meet this moment open with openness. You don't have to solve a huge crisis. You don't have to accomplish some activity. You just need to choose in your own heart, feel who you are, and be here in this moment.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The power is now. It's not anywhere else. It's always right here, right now. In the veil, I keep saying it's thick, but it's actually thin. There is no—this gets into some other ideas, but there's no physical universe, actually. What there is is the experience of a physical universe. There's you—your consciousness—and it's having an experience of context.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the veil simply allows you to focus on that experience. But if you stop focusing on it—if you stop focusing on the sense data, the sight, sound, smell, the touch, the thoughts—if you step back from all that, you very naturally will find that you are already on the other side of the veil.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not like you're completely stuck here. There's just a portion of you that is completely focused here, and because of the veil, you can't seem to find your way out. But the big you—the true you, your higher self—is always everywhere. It's always on the other side of the veil, and you're already connected to those systems.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's why out-of-body experiences can happen, and other—you know, we can go to other environments. I mean, I've had a few experiences where I've seen environments out-of-body that are so beautiful. They're there. The colors are alive and rich, and you could spend all day looking at the grass—you know, if it's a reality system with grass because we like grass.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But you know, how can I go there when I'm here? Well, I am only partially here. And I just happen to have some awareness of that. I mean, I'm actually very thankful that I don't have more memory. I have thanked my guides that the veil remains over me to the extent that it does because, like I said, it's painful having some knowledge.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I feel like the people—when I walk down the street and I see other people, I feel love for them. And I feel that these other people are my brothers and sisters who just are convinced—yeah, that's okay. There's nothing wrong with that. The veil's here for a reason. I mean, this whole thing is here for a reason. It's not like this is a big mistake.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Final Reflections on Love and Human Experience**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Final_Reflections_on_Love_and_Human_Experience**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Final Reflections on Love and Human Experience</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian shares his ultimate message: that love is the most powerful force and that every human life is a meaningful journey." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_shares_his_ultimate_message:_that_love_is_the_most_powerful_force_and_that_every_human_life_is_a_meaningful_journey."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian shares his ultimate message: that love is the most powerful force and that every human life is a meaningful journey.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mira: What you're saying is truly extraordinary, and I know that we can keep on talking about so much more.

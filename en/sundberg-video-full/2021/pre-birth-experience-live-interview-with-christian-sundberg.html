I'm not going to ask him to go into detail because I will put a link to his other interview. But we were just discussing that we'd like to talk about some of the fundamental importances of why we're here, really, and what does it feel like—that home feeling—and all about love.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I'm going to open it up to Christian, and he has a new book as well, which is very exciting, that I'd like to discuss. I thought I'd let Christian speak to you for a while about what he feels is important for this live event. And again, thank you so much for joining us, and then we'll open it up to an audience Q&amp;A.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, without further ado, welcome Christian Sundberg to Passion Harvest Live. I'm so honored and excited to have you on the show tonight—today, wherever you are in the world.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian Sundberg:<br>
Thank you, Luisa. I'm happy to be here. Thank you for all the work that you do.

I don't actually think it's that important. I think what's more important is that we spend the time we have to remind each other of what we're doing here—what this physical experience on Earth is all about.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As we go about our earthly lives, we tend to get really wrapped up in the forms and in the stories so much. It can help to have a moment of pause, like this one, to just take a moment to remind ourselves of what we know deep down that we may have forgotten. Of course, as we come to be human, we agree to forget a lot of what we really are, and that is a natural part of the play—the game of life.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We come to be these characters to have this experience from this vantage point. But I think it's very meaningful to remind each other, when we can, of what we really are. Because in what we really are, there is nothing to fear, and there is amazing power and joy.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I just want to speak to that at a high level in a general way. I hope that whoever is listening, if you can try to sense deep down—underneath all the repeating thoughts that seem to be so important in the day-to-day, underneath all the pain and all the things that you think are so important in your life that draw away your peace—I hope you can at least sense a little bit of what we're talking about here today.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because it's bigger than words. It's bigger than thoughts. That's just something I'll disclaim very quickly. None of this can actually be said in language. It's just not possible because our higher natures transcend the world of form, the world of duality. Duality is not what we are. We experience duality.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, it's quite impossible to take language from our world and try to describe these things. It's just not possible. But the deeper parts of us know. So, at a very high level, I just would like to say: whoever you are listening today, you are not just human. You're not just this character that you're playing right now.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The "you" that feels like you to you—the "you" that you most are—is who you really are. And that "you" is knowing the experience of being this person in this place. This experience is very dense and high contrast by comparison. It is also very, very high opportunity.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, while we are not fully the human character, we are in a place where we can experience something that has incredible potential. And it's very important for us and powerful for us to focus on that potential rather than the fear—rather than all the self-perceptions that we seem to get wrapped up in that seem so real: perceptions of powerlessness or being unworthy of love, not having freedom.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">These are some of the key perceptions that we deal with as humans on Earth. As we lose ourselves in those deep perceptions and then tell stories about it for years and years, we feel fear. But our fundamental nature never changes.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are beings of love and joy and creativity and power and freedom. And that is what we really are. That is the true substance of spirit. It's the substance of life itself—with a capital "L"—and the living presence that you feel right now, this livingness in your body and in your mind, the alertness of your mind, is made of that very stuff—that very life, that very love and joy and peace.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Whereas the fear is not fundamentally real. It's something that we entertain for a while because we are engaging an experience of high contrast, high constraints that can provoke fear. But the fear doesn't ultimately have the power. What has the power is the life and the love that we really are.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I think that is the single most important thing we can remind each other of—how we find that and feel that from here. Of course, it's very personal. We're all extremely unique souls, unique beings. We look at each other, and we see human physiology that looks quite similar, but in fact, each one of us is incredibly unique, has an incredibly different history, has incredibly different qualities and vibrational nature.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, the way that we exchange and interact with the divine will be very unique. So, while I can't say it in a categorical way, I at least want to remind everybody to just sense a little bit about what we really are underneath this story.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I'm happy to entertain any questions. I'll do my best. I'm just an explorer like anybody else. I don't have all the answers, of course. And anyway, you don't need to listen to somebody external. Look within. Feel the spirit within your own connection to the divine, your own deeper knowing. Your higher self—the full you—knows and already knows. So, that's an important reminder too.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Luisa:<br>
Beautiful, beautiful messages there, Christian. You're such a ray of light, such a positive being. For those, whatever their situation, that may be struggling or suffering—whatever the causes are—what is your advice?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Suffering and Acceptance**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Suffering_and_Acceptance**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Suffering and Acceptance</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where suffering is framed as an opportunity for transformation, and Christian emphasizes the importance of accepting rather than resisting painful experiences." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_suffering_is_framed_as_an_opportunity_for_transformation,_and_Christian_emphasizes_the_importance_of_accepting_rather_than_resisting_painful_experiences."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where suffering is framed as an opportunity for transformation, and Christian emphasizes the importance of accepting rather than resisting painful experiences.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian Sundberg:<br>
Well, of course, that's very personal as well. There are so many ways we can suffer and struggle, and each person is so unique with how they meet that suffering and struggling.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But just one idea that is important that comes to mind that I'll raise up is that this reality, as firm as it is, is not our enemy. The experience we have here is not our enemy. It can feel like we live in a world of enemies and in a universe that may be cruel. But the universe is not cruel. It is simply firm, and it is a consistent context.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As consistent as the context is, that firm, that strong, is how your spirit can be refined through the application against that context—through choice-making through the context. So, the challenges of our lives are actually opportunities—really powerful opportunities.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I know that's not easy to feel, but one of the main things we can do to then feel that is to try to accept, try to not fight and resist. Because it is in the labeling and in the resistance that the vast majority of our pain and suffering comes from—in rejecting the experience we're having and setting up friction with ourselves against it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In fact, even when great pain arrives, if we can seek to just allow it and feel it and know it without a story, without a label, it's not truly deeper than you are. Put it that way. The consciousness that knows the pain is deeper than the pain that you might know. And you are deeper than the fear you might know.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I think that's an important thing to remember as we engage those fears. But just one comment—and there's so many things we could say about fear and how we meet it—but that's just one important thing to remember.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Luisa:<br>
Can I ask one or two more questions, and then we'll open it up to the course?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian Sundberg:<br>

Yes, so we do choose our life context, and then we make free will choices in that context once we're here. In the pre-life review planning, at least the way I experienced it, I was aware of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold—or was very likely to unfold, or less likely to unfold.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it is about knowing ahead of time what it will be like to be this person and to experience it from this perspective. Does that mean it's all pre-established? No. It's just that the system is super, super good at predicting outcome. It has all the information. It knows everybody very well.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But the variable is choice-making—free will choice-making within the context. So, while you don't have free will choice to choose any choice—you have to choose choices within the rules—but within the system's context, you are quite free to make whatever choice you wish. And so, that will affect how the life plays out.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, we do review ahead of time, and then once we're here, we have total freedom to do what we will with the life. We're not bound as much as we think we are. There may be certain constraints that last for a lifetime. You might be born without a limb or something—that's a constraint that will last.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But generally speaking, we are far less limited than it seems on the surface, and we can choose and affect our lives in a very positive way as we go through the process. But yes, we do review ahead of time.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Human Experience as an Opportunity**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Human_Experience_as_an_Opportunity**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Human Experience as an Opportunity</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where human life is compared to an extreme sport, offering unique challenges that lead to deep spiritual growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_human_life_is_compared_to_an_extreme_sport,_offering_unique_challenges_that_lead_to_deep_spiritual_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where human life is compared to an extreme sport, offering unique challenges that lead to deep spiritual growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And from the perspective of the spirit pre-life, it's actually a super, super exciting opportunity—a super exciting opportunity to come and to be this, to have this extreme being. Human is like an extreme sport. It's like climbing Mount Everest or something. Not everybody wants to do that because it's really hard. It can be really hard.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It doesn't have to be really hard, but it can be really hard. Or maybe another analogy I like is going to outer space—putting on a spacesuit and going into a very hostile environment. That's a little bit metaphorically what it's like. And we do that because there's so much opportunity in this environment—opportunity that is not available in the far less constraining state.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, we do review that and choose that ahead of time intentionally, even if we don't remember making that choice. And I know the human ego is very quick to not be okay with that because, "How? I would never sign up for this. This is hell. No way."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I understand. I'm not making light of it. But from the standpoint of the spirit that is not bound and knows its eternal power and its freedom and its immortality and the power of the love and the substance of what we are, it knows there's nothing truly to fear from that perspective.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It can be seen that this, even though this is highly constraining—and actually, perhaps even because it's highly constraining—there's so much opportunity here that we are honored, actually, to be given a chance to live a human life. It's an amazing honor.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Luisa:<br>

Okay, so I feel that—personally—okay, so I personally feel that the human incarnation cycle, or not even just the human incarnation cycle, but the physical incarnation cycle into universes like this, does potentially have an end. It's not something that we would choose to necessarily do forever.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, the process of evolution overall does not have an end. And that is because the expansion of love and joy is worth continually refining. This is really hard to put language on, but there is no—the soul has no limit in a sense. So, it will continuously and ever evolve and refine itself towards love, towards higher and higher states of refinement and perfection, you might say.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the physical incarnation process—the whole cycle that we go through here, even thousands of lives—is just one course or something, one school, maybe one place that we can participate in that expansion. This is just a really extreme and specialized high-opportunity, high-speed, maybe you could say high-efficiency state—a place to come to participate in evolution in a very specific and powerful way.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Luisa:<br>

Could you please tell me what becomes of all the animals that are being abandoned, abused, and trapped in experimental labs and, gosh, factory farming, etc.?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian Sundberg:<br>
Yeah, okay. So, first of all, I'm going to reread that for you. No, I—yeah, I understand. I think I understand. So, okay, so there's not—don't—I would encourage us not to think about the fundamental thing as being whether we are human or animal. Human or animal are just experiences that a being can have.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, it's not like there's a fundamental distinction in the substance of what fundamentally is knowing being an animal and knowing being a human. From the human vantage point, we think humans are one thing, and animals are super different, and they must have some other thing. Well, really, we're not human either.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We're us, and we know the experience of being human or being something else. And not even just earthly context—I don't know much about this specifically, but I'm aware that there are other worlds, not just Earth. So, there's a lot of possibility of things that we can experience being.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's just that each one offers a unique point of perspective, a unique cognitive experience. Being human is a highly specialized, unique cognitive point of perspective, and being an animal is a different kind of experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, okay, so the thing is—okay, so even every experience has value. Every experience, even if a being comes and experiences only a very comparatively short physical experience, that still is very high value because this is such a rich and high-contrast state.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, you know, even a baby who—or a being who experiences being a fetus in the womb and is never born—even that is so valuable. There's so much power and additiveness in even just that short experience. And, of course, being an animal is a highly valuable experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, the pre-life selection process is—when that happens, the spirit is aware of what the life will likely be like. And if it is beneficial for the spirit to know that, to have that experience, they will then agree to have that experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that being said, I'm not—I am not in any way saying we should be okay with treating animals poorly. We should absolutely—love means all beings need to be accepted and loved and cared for and treated as a part of ourselves—all beings.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But also, in the pre-life, the spirit is aware of what this life will approximately be like. And if there is value to signing up for having that experience, they will. It is also possible—and this is going to sound probably a little strange—but nothing strange on Passion Harvest.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, good. It's also possible for the system to play the character itself—like, in other words, not like an NPC, a non-player character. So, a bot—it looks like a body, looks like it's active, but there's no actual free-will awareness using the experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's possible. I don't know how many times that happens. I'm just saying that if it's a particularly cruel situation, I just imagine it's possible that no one—I don't know. I mean, I think even the most difficult situations have so much potential that I think even they—you know, there will be a being that is interested in having that experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I'm just saying it's also possible that no being has to necessarily use the experience of a given avatar. The avatars aren't fundamentally real. They're just characters that can be used.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Luisa:<br>

Okay, yes, we do. Okay, but in my case, my life intention preceded the knowledge of who my parents would be. I had an intention for what I wanted to experience and accomplish in this life, and then the guides brought to me a life packet—a life package.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm just calling it that. It's just this life that had so much potential in it that was a good match for what I wanted to do. And as I reviewed it, I did know very much who the parents were. In fact, I even have a memory of being aware of the parents when they first met, even though I wasn't born for some time until sometime after that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I remember reviewing the qualities of my parents—my mother and my father—and knowing that the way their natures would be really important for how they would likely raise me and how I would then grow up to have the strength and confidence necessary to meet the fear that I came to meet.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, yes, we do review the parents ahead of time. In my case, it wasn't specifically primarily about the parents, but the parents made possible this very precious opportunity. They were absolutely integral to—I mean, think of how much work each person goes through in their whole life just to get to the point of being a parent, and then all the rigors of parenthood to raise a child.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh my gosh, it's such a humongous effort. And so, to—and that can be seen from the other side. And so, it's known, "Oh my goodness, if I could be the being that plays that character—that and like your parents from the other side—you know, they're like you. We have such a deep relationship with us all—like, so many souls. All the souls are connected to each other.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, we know that they're not just this human—these couple humans. They are the beings who are playing these humans, and we have so much respect for those beings—not just the characters they're playing, but the beings that they really are that are knowing these characters. We have so much respect for them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, wow, they went through all this work to come to this point in their life, and now I get to be their child. Oh my goodness, that's very humbling and powerful. So, yes, we do get to choose our parents.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I know also that can be hard because I've had a lot of people that have made comments to me to the effect of, "But my parents were terrible to me. They were abusive. They were cruel." And I know that's quite common on Earth. And I'm not making light of that at all.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sometimes the parents take their own fear path deeper than maybe was initially anticipated. But anyway, even those paths, we know there is incredible opportunity in it. We wouldn't be signing up for the experience unless there was a great meaning and an opportunity for us to have that experience unless there was a great meaning and an opportunity for us to have that experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you, beautifully answered.

We use one word—"love." It’s just the closest word we can come up with, but it means far more than one emotion. It's far bigger than romantic love, familial love, friendship love. The Greeks had different words for every type of love, but there's even more than just that. Even the experience of beauty—like if you look at a sunset and feel connected to it—that is also a feeling of the love and the connectedness of what we are.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is absolutely beyond description, and yet, yes, we do feel glimmers of it here. But I personally feel that it's quite rare, even here, to really find it in the earthly context. We are still connected there, so it is still possible for us to fully know it while we’re human. We’re not totally trapped here—it just feels like it. It feels like we’re, you know, we’re committed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Our true nature is always connected. We can never not be what we really are. We are always a part of the whole—always, always. That deeper love is always just around the corner. It cannot be far. But on the conscious level of the human character, it’s quite common that we don’t feel that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Of course, when we do feel it at the human level, it is like a dull, local reflection. I’m not speaking against the human experience—I’m just saying that what is possible here on Earth, by comparison, is quite muted in the way we might experience love. It’s still powerful, though.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One other thing I’ll say—so we’re so deeply incarnated here, right? If we can know love all the way out here and really make connections—loving relationships, parent to child, romantic love, friendship love, all the different kinds of love—if we really know that here, that is a powerful, powerful thing. It’s a powerful bond. Even though we might not feel it the same way we really know it there, the love is real. That connection is what we are already.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So when we love each other here, that love absolutely lasts. And while we might be physically separated—even if one person’s body dies and they are set free—that connection between the two individuals is absolutely strong and still there. That loving, powerful bond of love that we formed all the way out here in the dense physical is a very powerful bridge. A loving thought is like a trail or a bridge that they can follow back to us and be with us. That love is eternal. We have many more relationships than just what we remember on Earth.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I just wanted to make that comment because I don’t want to make it sound like love on Earth is somehow not important. Oh my gosh, it’s so important. It’s the substance of what we’re doing. So even though we might not feel it in the same breath, it’s so powerful and important when we can express love and know love here.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you.

I'll simply say that I was aware that Earth is going through a very well-known awakening process. I’m not going to put any terms on that. I don’t know—I’ve heard the terms "3D," "5D," but I’m not sure exactly what they might entail specifically.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I do know that Earth is going through an awakening process, and that is a raising of the vibration of the collective consciousness of this group. We are attempting a very exciting, difficult, relatively quick transition—awakening from very old fear-based thought patterns into a new, higher vibration state for the collective.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We’re in the process of doing that right now. It’s a high-friction process because we’re doing it relatively quickly. The density of the fear-based assumptions, beliefs, and content in our human collective consciousness is so dense. We have so much fear—we have thousands of years of history of "us versus them" thinking, of life being cheap, of living in a world where we literally eat the bodies of other creatures to sustain ourselves. It’s a really extreme environment.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So we have thousands of years of this deeply ingrained in our collective consciousness. It’s a rather mighty and ambitious thing that we’re doing—waking up to our true nature.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One thing I want to say about that that’s super important: it’s important that we do not become overwhelmed by the scope of the entire transition. No. You only need to think about yourself. Or rather, you only need to be aware of your own fear and develop yourself—work through your own fear and bring love into your own life. You don’t need to worry about the whole. You don’t need to worry about the entire state of the world.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**How Individuals Contribute to Awakening**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**How_Individuals_Contribute_to_Awakening**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>How Individuals Contribute to Awakening</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where personal inner work is emphasized as the most effective way to contribute to Earth’s transformation rather than focusing on external problems." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_personal_inner_work_is_emphasized_as_the_most_effective_way_to_contribute_to_Earth’s_transformation_rather_than_focusing_on_external_problems."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where personal inner work is emphasized as the most effective way to contribute to Earth’s transformation rather than focusing on external problems.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If you meet your own fear, you are a part of the solution. Imagine the collective consciousness of humanity like a pond—a smaller body of water within the bigger ocean, but still its own thing. You are a part of that collective. That may sound like a fancy term, but it just means all of us involved in the human experience are part of one group in consciousness space.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And in that volume of consciousness, what even one person does affects the whole pond. If you meet your own experience, overcome your own fear, and bring love into your own life—even in the smallest way—you are affecting the entire whole. We tend to focus so much on the events on the surface—the political problems, people suffering. And yes, we should absolutely do our best to address those.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But it’s important not to lose ourselves in the extremity of the friction on the surface. What comes first is consciousness. Consciousness is first. The physical stuff is second.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So it’s an empowering message. This awakening that’s happening—we’re all part of it, whether we are aware of it or not. And there are a lot of non-physical guides who are part of it, too, trying to help us out.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But we do have a lot more power to contribute to it. And one other last comment I'll make is, I know a lot of people feel that they want a quick solution. You know, because look, Earth's got a lot of huge problems. Why don't I see the solution right now? Well, there's a lot of change happening. If you just look even to 30 years ago, think of how many things are different compared to 30 years ago. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But not only physically, vibrationally there is a huge difference. There's a... I can feel energy sometimes, and I feel that the energy of the collective has been increasing. It's quite noticeable. But it takes time, so don't be overwhelmed with the time scale. You know, even if it takes a few hundred years or something, that's not a big deal. We are timeless beings, and we're doing a rather ambitious thing here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So do today what you can do today, and you'll be doing a lot more than you think. I'm saying that do that rather than losing yourself in the "Oh my gosh, there's so much to fix." Well, then you lose your peace, and that's not as helpful. It's more helpful to know peace, know joy, and do your best to bring that into the world and into your own experience, into the people around you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Great, great.

So it's not like they have to go anywhere physical. Consciousness is all connected to all consciousness. Imagine a huge ocean that's already one. It's already a part of itself. So if you are already an integral part of it, you are not actually separate from it. That's an important context because consciousness is the fundamental substrate, we could say. And the fundamental action that takes place is intent. That is, we wield an intention, and intent is always powerful. It always has an effect.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the physical, we don't see the effect right away sometimes. Sometimes we do. Most of the time, it's super slow, super dense. But our intention always has an effect. Prayer is the word we use for a dedicated, focused intention back toward the divine, back towards the source, or towards whatever form we name it. And that focused intention does have an effect. If we are more lukewarm, not focused in that intention, then it's not very effective comparatively. Though that still will have... everything, all intent, always has some effect.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But meanwhile, if we are focused and genuine... and when I say genuine, I mean that authenticity of how we approach that prayer is key. It's not the action; it's who you really are. It's your true intent. What is your true intent? What are you truly intending and praying for? That true intention has an effect and is known. It's always seen. Every single thought that we have is seen and known, not just prayer. Prayer is just the word we use for when we set aside the time and intention to do that with some intention. And then the quality of the intention we bring into that activity is very powerful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I think that's the best way I can try to speak. Beautifully said.

We're not actually stuck here, but it can seem like it on the surface because the reality experience, this physical reality, is very consistent. Very effective at being consistent. You know, that's one property of the physical. It just stays firm. So because of that, when we're presented with that firmness and we can feel even just a little of what we really are, we yearn to be back in that freedom. We can yearn to be back in that freedom and to be back in knowing the full unity and the love of our true nature.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so I'm not making light of that homesickness. It's one of the main reasons that we are veiled, in fact, because if we weren't veiled, the homesickness would be ridiculous. Okay, but so from my own case, I have made the powerful personal discovery that even that homesickness is an opportunity for growth. Because for so many years, I resisted it and rejected it, and I was pissed. Just being totally honest, I was just so angry at some level that I was stuck here and that I had to deal with... like when pain arose, sometimes I have periods of great pain, great physical or neurological pain in my life. When they arise, sometimes it's easy for my ego, of course, to rise up and say, "Screw this, I don't like this. I reject this."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But that is an opportunity to surrender precisely to even that. Even the separation, even the pain, even the homesickness. When we can let go of our own ego response so much that we allow and accept even that we feel completely separate, even that we have pain that seems like it will not go anywhere... when we can fully allow and fully accept this experience as it arises to us, even knowing our higher nature to some degree, there is a profound growth, a profound freedom. And then once we fully accept, ironically, the boundary drops. Not because we tried to, not because we tried to get rid of it, but when we release fully and fully accept, the love and the peace and the joy of what we really are rises back up all on its own. Because it's what we always were. It was our resistance that caused the separation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, when we fight it and when we reject it through ego response, that is painful. But when we fully allow even that separation, it's powerful. I love the phrase... and this phrase really ticked me off when I first heard it. It was in my counselor's office years ago when I was getting EMDR therapy. At first, I remember being irritated by this phrase, but I have since discovered it's not just cute; it's extremely accurate. "Power lies in accepting powerlessness."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So if we accept even the powerlessness of being veiled, being here, being physical, having a body that has limitation... wow, there is a lot of power in that. Where else can you do that other than here? And later, when we're done, we can share and say, "You remember what I did? I did this." And you share it telepathically with another being. And if it's a being who hasn't been veiled and physical, they may say, "How? That's not even possible. How did you possibly do that? Unbelievable that you came, that you did that, and that you even came to terms with it. Oh my goodness." Well, here you are. Here's the opportunity right now to do that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you for sharing that, Christian. You're answering the questions amazingly, and we're getting so many good questions from the Trash and Harvest family. Thank you so much.

But the thing is... so I've had that thought many times. I know you have. I admit, however, I also am aware that I am not at the vantage point right now that I can see clearly. So my ego is my ego that says, "I'm never doing this again." I very well may decide not to. I don't know. But I can't make the decision now. The part of us that makes that decision is the part of us that's rejecting the difficulty.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm not making light of that at all. Yeah, but yes, it is up to you. So if you are on the other side... so from the other side's vantage point, we have no limitation, but we also know exactly what we've been. It's not like we're deluded, and that's why we sign up. No, we have full knowledge. But we have full knowledge of what we really are too, which is so much deeper, so much bigger, so much greater. And we see very importantly how much growth potential there is in the physical experience. It is off the charts. And the quality of the refinement of our being that we can accomplish here is off the charts.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So from that vantage point, you will get to decide: Would you like to go another round or not? It is your choice, absolutely. And it has to be your choice. I feel it has to be your choice because the spirit is sovereign. What I mean is, you're a part of Source at the deepest level. The soul is sovereign. So how can it lose its power and be veiled other than to surrender it itself? And that is what the veiling is. It's a process of surrendering your own... like letting a cloak onto you and into you that limits you. And the only way that can work is if you give it permission and surrender because you're sovereign.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So yes, you will get a choice, and you're allowed to choose anything you want.

But that because our true nature is ancient, it precedes all of this anyway. And then it uses it as a valuable, limited experience.

Okay, well, first of all, I'll just say that there are other reality systems where untruth is possible as a general comment. In systems where we are similarly veiled or veiled to some extent and where we are in a system of limited information and where fear-based choice-making can happen, deception can arise from that. It's possible for there to be a form of deception in some other realities.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, I definitely feel that the light is not a deception. The light is the true light of being. It transcends all of the limitations of Earth. But what we do on Earth... I'm not making light of this question, but what we do... no pun on words by the way... yeah, no final words. So but what we do on Earth is we... we live in an extreme duality right now. And we live in a world where deception is almost a daily occurrence. Like, my spam email box right now is probably full of 50 phishing scams trying to get my personal information to steal my money. You know, like, we all... I'm just like, it's commonplace that there's deception on Earth.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And we live in a world where there's even things like killing other creatures and death, and there's all these deep, deep, deep, deep themes that we've worked with for thousands of years. Deception and the power of other beings over us is a common theme on Earth. So what we do is then we take those themes and we apply them up the ladder. We're afraid, so we think, "What if that is a trick? Because I hurt on Earth. This incarnation thing sucks. I don't want to do this anymore. This must be a trap." And then we apply it up the ladder.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, it is a duality-conditioned belief that we learned locally. And our true nature fully transcends all duality. Our higher self is in a state of total knowing. There is no deeper... like, thing that can be false. That there is only the connectedness and the knowing and the fullness and the joy of what we are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so from the human vantage point, I've heard this belief before. I feel it's a really good example of human Earth-based, fear-based thinking that we then kind of enshrine. I mean, just that just the general belief that the reincarnation cycle is a trap. Now, it is possible. I will say that there is such a thing as beings who reincarnate and then reincarnate, and they get pretty well... how do I describe it? Not addicted... we'll just say their terminal velocity is low. You know, like, they're... let's say, like, I don't know, maybe like orbiting a planet or something, and they just keep going around because they haven't... they're really sticky.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because the Earth experience is so dense and so stimulating. Like, being human is so dense, so stimulating. It's like, wow. Or not just human, but any physical experience. So when we're free from that, there are many beings who immediately... wow, I know there's another thing I want to experience. There's nothing I'm going to do. And it can be almost routine or... these are really bad words because I really don't want to limit it. I'm just saying that it's... it's possible for someone to kind of not be stuck but be in a pattern of a reincarnation cycle.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, that's not our true nature. And as we evolve and as we grow, freedom is our natural state. So eventually, one way or the other, we're going to work... we will be free of even this cycle. It's kind of like... how about this? How about like you play a video game, and it's stimulating and kind of addictive, and then you come back a few hours later, and all you can think about is doing the game again? I mean, this isn't a great metaphor, but then you play it again, and then you play, you know, and you do it enough times, eventually it's like, "You know what? That was really stimulating and fun, but I'm not going to do that anymore now." That's empty. It doesn't really have any true substance to it. Maybe a little bit like that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In that, we tend to get addicted. So we get addicted not just to the experience; we get addicted to thinking. Like, even right now, we get addicted to our own thinking or thoughts. Human thoughts are very dense, stimulating. Wow, wow, think. Wow, that thought was stimulating. Wow, that thought was stimulating. That was stimulating. That's one of the reasons that meditation is so powerful because it's like de-addicting yourself to the drug of thinking. It's like stepping back and allowing yourself to know your deeper, more refined nature. And that can be helpful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So anyway, but in that whole thing, I just want to highlight: There's nothing to fear. You're not stuck. We are never stuck. We do always have free will. It's just that there's a lot of attraction to experience that is this dense because of the potential that it offers. It's all about the potential and the growth that can occur on Earth that is difficult to occur elsewhere.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Great. Next question from Mike Hope Park Junction: "I find the fact of not recalling previous lives and having no memory of between lives when we get to know our true selves very difficult.

The text discusses the possibility of continuing personalities after death and the experience of multiple characters as part of the whole.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, oh, absolutely. Okay, so the higher self can play a number of characters. And that's just that means you, who you really are, are not just this character. Your other characters too. But it's not different people. It's you. Same you, same exact you, just knowing different experiences. And at the deepest level, yes, that higher you, that is you, can and will know the breadth of all that you are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's also possible for the higher you to play one character for a while and let that character go off and develop on its own for the purposes of expansion. And so from the perspective of that one character, it may seem like the other characters are not consciously available, at least for a time.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is possible, for example, for some personalities to continue the experience of that personality after the death of the physical body, whereas others may not do that. I don't know a lot about that, but I know there are astral locations where some beings who are very accustomed to Earth will go and experience an Earth-like environment for a while as their human personality as a form of transition.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But it's also possible to go directly to the state of, "Oh, I'm not the character. I'm all my characters." And you don't need to die to do that either, by the way. You know, you're the deepest being that you are. It's you. It's these characters. And I experienced one time after I meditated, I suddenly became aware of hundreds of other lives that I had. That I was like... it wasn't other beings. It was me. Than me. That feels like me to me. Just did all these other many other things, and they're a part of me. And the strengths and qualities of those characters are a part of me too. Like, it's all part of it. It's all part of me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So yes, we can definitely reach a place where we know the totality of what we are. And simultaneously, we also might have experiences for some short or long durations where we feel like one specific character intentionally. But that character is always a part of the whole.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay. Thank you. Hello, Carol Richardson. Her message for Christian: "Do we choose experiences that play out what we delivered to others? I'm assuming this is a bit like a comic in a previous life so that we feel what others felt but in human form rather than a life review."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, I read that again: "Do we choose experiences that play out what we delivered to others?" Okay, yeah, no, I understand. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Reviewing Past Life Actions**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Reviewing_Past_Life_Actions**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Reviewing Past Life Actions</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where souls reflect on their past actions and gain insight into their personal growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_souls_reflect_on_their_past_actions_and_gain_insight_into_their_personal_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where souls reflect on their past actions and gain insight into their personal growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So the simplest way to say it is yes. But it's not that we're bound like we have to experience a certain thing because as a punishment or something. It's not a punishment. It's that we are who we are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so if we go into an experience and we act in fear and hurt somebody, and then through the life review, we become aware, "Oh, I have that much fear. I have that much ego. I did that." That's a part of you. That's who you are. So it's not that you are required to go experience that same pain. It's not about the pain. It's about re-fleshing out and filling out and refining out into your own shortcomings.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so yes, it's not about punishment. It's about there are areas of growth that are optimal that we choose to sign up for because we see that we have a weak spot there. Like, in this life, I am walking on my weak leg. Like, I have a deep fear that overcame me in the past. I was a super unhelpful, mean person in one of my lives. And so I'm here dealing with that same pain now, even though I didn't do those things in this life. It's a part of me. And it's okay because I'm responsible for it, whether it's then or now. There's not a big difference.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, to a human personality, it feels like, "Oh, wow, a different lifetime. That's a big deal." It's not really a big deal. It's just same you, just knowing a different experience. It's still a part of you. So that means now, right now, any now, is the key moment that we can choose to meet and process even those shortcomings. We can own our own crap. And if we can honor our crap now, we process it. We don't do it just to escape the karma cycle. It's again not about punishment.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We do it because we expand and we grow in that way. And once we expand and grow, that's wonderful and beautiful. You know, it's not that we have to do that. It's that we want to grow towards love. And you know, there are patterns within us that might follow us from experience to experience as we do that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thanks, Christian. I've got a message from Unrelated. They say, "I have a question. This is complicated. I have a question. Isn't using a human incarnation/ego to further the soul's growth a bit like animal testing? Like an ends justify the means? The means permit an ends."  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Is Human Life Just a Test?**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Is_Human_Life_Just_a_Test?**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Is Human Life Just a Test?</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian argues that life is not a cruel experiment but a deeply creative and enriching experience." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_argues_that_life_is_not_a_cruel_experiment_but_a_deeply_creative_and_enriching_experience."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian argues that life is not a cruel experiment but a deeply creative and enriching experience.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, the question is a little bit like asking, "Is lifting weights that terrible act of lifting weights, that terrible thing? Is lifting those terrible heavy weights is that worth doing? Like, why would we ever do that?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, I also don't like this metaphor because that makes it sound like we only do it for the product of our experience. The experience itself is additive. So in this metaphor, lifting the weight is an additive function immediately. Immediately, the moment we are experiencing it is additive because all that is with a capital A can expand and become more as discrete experience is known.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that process is one we sign up for, not just for personal expansion but because we are performing a service by knowing this and not that for a time, even potentially painful this and not that. It's not that the pain is good. It is not that the pain is good. Pain is not even necessary technically. It's just that in knowing discrete experience, we are participating in a creative process. And we are creative beings, and so we love to do that. We love to expand in that way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And every way that we experience lack and even desire... you know, every hole that we dig that isn't filled while we're human can and will then ultimately be filled because now we know exactly what it's like to have that hole, to have that missing thing. And now forever, our true nature can fill it and know it forever. And that is a... in that way, contrast is a useful additive tool, not a curse, not just a means to an end but also it has a purpose. It does have an end to it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I hope that answers the question. It's very hard to speak about that from here because the human ego, which is in duality, sees things in a very from A to B thing way. You know, that is how we see things on Earth. You know, we light a match, we get flame, we get flame, we can light a fire, the fire can burn the chicken, whatever. You know, whatever. Like, we think all of reality is like that. But our entire system of duality and contrast arises within that which transcends it fully. It fully transcends it. It just uses it almost...  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't want to use the word "experiment" in the way that the question used the word "experiments." It sounds very negative. But it is a creative experiment in the way that like we're deeply curious, and we're deeply creative. And because we're so curious and so creative and so powerful, we will do even this. And it's okay that we do it. It's wonderful that we do it, in fact.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm not saying that means it's easy. This is the place where it can be hard. Like, really hard. So hard that many people... and again, I am not making light of this... many people will become so overwhelmed that they will literally kill their own bodies even today. That's how overwhelming this contrast on this world can be interpreted and experienced.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm not making light of that. I'm just saying that to the degree that it is that challenging, it is even more creative and useful if we allow it to be. Thanks. I'm sorry if that's not satisfying to the ego.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, you expressed that really well. Are you like... there's no way to answer that question in words. There's just no way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I have a question from Rachel J: "I have a hard time with the fact that I chose my parents. They're both narcissistic and not nice or nurturing in any way."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I know you touched on that briefly. Yeah, so now that you're here, what will you do today? You know, we tend to think that these things we have to do in life and accomplish in life are really, really big. It's not about moving big mountains around. It's about how we meet exactly our experience today.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is extremely challenging to operate successfully in the world and to find the love and joy when you have been abused or when your parents are narcissistic. Your very conditioning then is from that. That's hard. And that is very admirable that you then now choose the love that you do from the context that you're in. Your guides see it, know it, they support you and love you. You may feel alone in it, but you're not. You're actually admired for a while.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now that you're in this context, what do you do with it? And it may seem like some small thing you do. Maybe it's forgiving them in some way or maybe it's expressing yourself and standing up for yourself in some way that you never had the courage to before. Or maybe it's ending that cycle with your own children. You know, stopping that narcissism and recognizing in yourself the patterns your parents passed on to you and saying, "You know what? I'm going to stop that, and I'm going to try to treat my kid better in a certain way."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Whatever way we can actualize the love that we really are... oh, that's powerful. And so the context that you have, try to see it as not just terrible. It's an opportunity. It's a context that you now get to do something with. And that is amazing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So in the meantime, I'm sorry to hear that. And I don't... also, I just say, try to feel deep down who you really are because narcissistic parents tend to make you really be conditioned to believe you're not worthy of love or you're not free or you're not powerful. The main things that we wrap ourselves up with as human... all those are completely contrary to the true nature of what we are. We are free and powerful and worthy of love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I hope that maybe even just now, even if just now, try to feel that somewhere deep down in there for a moment. And that's very powerful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thanks, Christian.

So I think that there's two things going on when we talk about ghosts. I think most of the time, what's happening is thought momentum in the... okay, so our thinking has momentum and creates... we'll call objects in the astral and higher in the realm above ours that's thought-responsive. Our thinking, our thoughts, our beliefs create things. Thoughts are things.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so when millions and millions of people, as an example, believe in something, it gets a strong thought form and then has kind of a life of its own, even though it's not a free-willed thing. It's like a pattern of energy that can kind of act in a way. Like, for instance, the belief in something like Satan as an example. You know, there's a lot of belief, a lot of momentum to it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so now as for ghosts, even one person's very strong emotional experience can set into motion a thought form. And that thought form, if powerful enough, can be perceived in some physical ways, you know, whether it be in visual or audio ways. So there might be a place like a house or something where someone had a strong emotion or something, and they set into motion a thought form, and now it's just repeating until it eventually might lose energy.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't know. I mean, I don't know about how that works. I just think that thought forms are a big part of what we experience. Also, another... a lot of people, you know, when they talk about having like an experience with a demonic being or something, that's also an example many times of fear-based thought forms that are just playing out.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, but is it possible for souls to be trapped? I don't like the word "trapped" ever because we are never, ever, ever trapped. However, it is possible to become so deeply associated with form and with the Earth or with some activity that we tend to stay focused on it for a while, whether it be locally here or whether it be in a non-physical environment that's Earth-like for a time.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Eventually, we'll all find our way back. And sometimes a guide will even just come and give us a little reminder, like, "Focus upward." You know, and as soon as we do that focusing and we call out to the divine or whatever form, we immediately reconnect because that's who we really are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I think it is possible for a free-willed being to focus for a time on the physical or on an experience like the physical. But I would never say that we're trapped. Now, I will say that fear can feel trapping. And that is true whether you're physical or whether you have a deep being-level fear that maybe you've taken with you, you haven't resolved yet.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Fear as a Barrier to Moving On**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Fear_as_a_Barrier_to_Moving_On**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Fear as a Barrier to Moving On</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he explains that fear can delay, but never permanently trap, a soul." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_explains_that_fear_can_delay,_but_never_permanently_trap,_a_soul."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he explains that fear can delay, but never permanently trap, a soul.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Fear is, by its definition, a distance away. It's an experiential distance further and further away because it's being wrapped up within a perception that is not in alignment with the truth. So by wrapping up in that perception, it creates a distance. And so many of us over our entire lives, even, will experience a fear that can create a distance. And that's what feels like being trapped.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it is possible for a fear not to be resolved in a given experience. But even then, that's not the true nature of what we are. Our true nature is the substance of life itself, spirit itself. And when we then let go and return to that true nature, there is no reason to fear. Fear is only possible when we don't know who we really are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's only when we're lost in the identity of something that seems not in alignment with the truth that we feel that fear.

I mean, it doesn't matter when there might be a physical cessation. The bond endures because love and love is what we are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In fact, some near-death experiencers who lost children young report meeting those children in a more grown-up state in some non-physical reality system because they've continued on even though they had only a very short time on Earth. And that, I think, is pretty common. I also think it's possible that the system would see the pregnancy situation and if it knows that it's certain that the avatar is not going to be available... just, you know, put it in blunt terms... it won't be assigned. You know, there's no need to have an incarnation happen. But if it is useful to be there for some being, even for like a day, then an incarnation could be selected.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't know how that all works. It's quite a complex system, and the guides are masters at figuring all that out. But I just know that even that experience is valuable. And yes, that connection does remain if a being did use that experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A question from AGC: "Do you think we can talk to people alive or dead on a spirit level in meditation?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Absolutely. Now, we're all connected all the time. So focusing an intent towards that person, there is a connection. Whether or not you can perceive their response is another matter. You know, of course, it's easy for the human on the human level for our imaginations to get involved, and we start imagining things that aren't necessarily really coming from outside of us.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Connecting with Spirits and Higher Beings**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Connecting_with_Spirits_and_Higher_Beings**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Connecting with Spirits and Higher Beings</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he describes how meditation and openness allow for communication with spiritual guides and departed loved ones." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_describes_how_meditation_and_openness_allow_for_communication_with_spiritual_guides_and_departed_loved_ones."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he describes how meditation and openness allow for communication with spiritual guides and departed loved ones.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But yes, we have that connection. It is a lasting, real connection. The distance, though, is not physical. It's vibrational. Okay, so like... if this is super crude, I'm just using a metaphor... but if Source is here, and we're all the way over here, you know, maybe they're in some... this is so dualistic. I kind of hate the metaphor, but if they're like in the middle or something, where there is a vibrational distance that is not too great, and that there can be a meeting, then yes, communication can occur.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that's why a lot of channelers or mediums who are truly channeling or truly doing mediumship... they have to be very high vibration. You know, they need to really rise up, and then the friends or the guys on the non-physical need to come down, and it has to be this meeting in the middle somewhere.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And sometimes also, that's why, by the way, some people will say that after a loved one passes, they have an experience where that person communicates to them, maybe even months later, maybe when they're in the shower or when they're like listening to the radio. Their guard is down. They're not thinking the negative thoughts. They're open. They're receptive. Their vibration is open and high. And so there's this window through which a message can be sent because now that person is at a state that has more matching vibration for that connection to be made.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So yes, it is possible.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Gosh, there's so many questions, but I'll just skim through a few. Actually, having... yeah, some about channeling and things.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Cat Likes Light Sparkles: "Again, a great question. If a person is living... this probably relates to a lot of the Passion Harvest audience to some extent... if a person is living a life alone and disconnected from family and has really no friends, is this person still connected to those that they are estranged from?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Absolutely. Absolutely. There's no physical distance. There's only the apparent experience of physical distance. You're connected not only to the people that you feel estranged from but to the entire human race and to all the non-physical friends that know you. Beings that you've forgotten you have. We all have very, very close friends and family that we don't even remember while we're on Earth. We're connected to them too.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Are We Ever Truly Alone?**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Are_We_Ever_Truly_Alone?**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Are We Ever Truly Alone?</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he reassures that no one is ever truly isolated, even if they feel disconnected." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_reassures_that_no_one_is_ever_truly_isolated,_even_if_they_feel_disconnected."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he reassures that no one is ever truly isolated, even if they feel disconnected.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So there is no such thing as truly being alone. The only way that we can be alone is when we look around us and don't see visual stimulus that shows bodies. And then we buy into that because, "Look, there's no bodies around me." I'm not making light of that. I'm just trying to highlight that we associate so deeply with our physical stimulus. We think that's it. But the consciousness that we are, the very field of the living awareness that is our body and that we feel as our body and that is the alert awareness right now... that very same awareness is integrally connected to all other beings and the whole.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so yes, we are absolutely connected to those that we may feel estranged from for a time.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you. Um, just a question from Rachel J. Do we keep a memory bank when we go back from our last life? I'm assuming when we return to the non-physical realms.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, yeah, all data is retained. Tom Campbell likes to call it a database. Many people call it the Akashic Records. But it's not just an external record; it's all experience that is valuable.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, the soul won't be beholding all experience at all times. You know, like right now, we're not experiencing everything that we are; we're having a very unique, refined, focused experience. So, in this moment, we may not be aware of other things that are a part of us, but the data is all there. Yeah, every experience is precious to the soul, so it doesn't throw it away.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, you know, there may be some things that are not as meaningful to us, but we assign the meaning. Right? So what's meaningful to us, and all the other data, in fact, is retained. It's useful to have that, and it can be reviewed if we so desire.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, I'm just reading all the comments, and I can't name everyone, but I just want to say there's lots of thank yous, and Christian, you're one of my favorite people, and so many compliments.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I think we might almost finish it there, but I just want to say thank you so much to Christian Sundberg for being on Passion Harvest and the incredible audience that has come out today, tonight, this morning, wherever you are in the world.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I always like to ask my guest, Christian, it's your platform today. So, God, you're an absolute wealth of information, but is there something you'd like to share with the Passion Harvest audience?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But first, your book: please go to Christian's website. I'll leave a link below in the show notes, and you can download his incredible book.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, Christian, I'll leave it up to you to share whatever message you'd like to, on a final note, with the audience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, okay. So instead of more words, since we've said many words, and I think I opened with the most important message I could say, um, let's just take a moment to connect. Our intention, our energy, doesn't need to be physically spoken at all times. Just put aside all the crap out of fear and all the labels for a moment and feel our connectedness to each other.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are brothers and sisters, all of us, even people who listen to this after the fact. Feel within you the connection.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I give thanks to all spirit for this opportunity and for everyone. Thank you very much for the honor, and thank you for the support.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And Lorisa, thank you very much for the opportunity today. Uh, it's always wonderful to discuss these things while we're in the physical.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, everybody who listens today has come a very long way. We've all taken very long journeys to be here at this moment, to connect in this way.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, I hope that everybody who goes from this remembers the preciousness that you are and the value of this day and is able to approach life with a little less fear today.

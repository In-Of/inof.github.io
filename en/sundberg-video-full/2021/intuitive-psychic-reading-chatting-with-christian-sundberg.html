Welcome, welcome! I am very excited today. I’ve got a really interesting, intriguing, amazing guest. This is Christian Sundberg. Hi, Christian!  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Hi.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> Christian is the author of a new book called <em>A Walk in the Physical</em>. His story is, I guess, not unique because it’s a story we’ve all kind of experienced, but what is unique is that he has memory of it. He has memory of the pre-existence, of planning his life, coming to Earth, using his free will to determine his planning for Earth. He’s going to share his story and all of the memories he has of this amazing pre-existence. So, Christian, please go ahead and share your story with us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Thank you so much. I’m honored to be here. Okay, so before I start, I just have to say that everything I’m going to attempt to say is really beyond language. There’s no way I can actually speak to this topic because words are form. They’re symbols from our local world. When we’re human, we assume that things of our world are all that there is, so we try to understand from the human vantage point. But our higher state, who we really are, the higher realms, and our true nature vastly transcend those symbols and the content of the Earth experience. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I’m going to try to use some words, but I just have to make that disclaimer because it’s not possible for anyone to simply say, “It’s like this.” It’s just not how it is. We’re in a state of being right now that is highly constrained and in a very specific point of perspective, and who we truly are vastly transcends that perspective. So, I just want to say that first.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> Perfect. Okay, so…  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Okay, so this is hard to talk about because these memories do have a sequence, but they also all feel like they’re happening all at once, like right now. So, I’m going to speak about them in sequence, but it gets a little bit difficult to do that. Our local linear time is artificial. Higher time is more difficult to speak to from here.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Encounter with an Inspiring Being" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Encounter_with_an_Inspiring_Being"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Encounter with an Inspiring Being</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian recounts meeting a beautiful being whose expansion through physical suffering inspired him to explore incarnation." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_recounts_meeting_a_beautiful_being_whose_expansion_through_physical_suffering_inspired_him_to_explore_incarnation."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian recounts meeting a beautiful being whose expansion through physical suffering inspired him to explore incarnation.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so long ago, before I had ever had any physical incarnations at all, I remember coming across a being who had been physical. This being was so beautiful. I remember coming across him and being deeply moved by what I felt of him, about his nature, about who he really was. I asked him—and again, this isn’t words; this is telepathic communication on that side—I said something to the effect of, “My goodness, look at you! What have you done? How are you this? How are you feeling? Are you feeling everything that I feel that you’re feeling?” And he shared that he was.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was so full of love, power, joy, expansiveness, and capacity. It was just beautiful. So, I asked him what he had done, and he shared with me that he had been physical. He shared, very immediately, this physical experience he had had where he had suffered a physical ailment of some kind—some kind of pain or sickness. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don’t know specifically what it was, but I remember reviewing his pain that he had gone through for years and how it just crushed him and pushed him so far in a certain direction. But he had chosen to meet that experience with openness and acceptance. He had integrated it, processed it, and brought love to that experience. In so doing, he had expanded in such a beautiful, incredible way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I asked him, “Were you healed?” because I saw how much he had been damaged—physically damaged and emotionally damaged. He said yes, and he shared with me this depth of healing. I could feel how deep he had been healed. I said, “Well, I want to do that. I’m going to do that.” I was just so inspired.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He said, “Okay, well then, go talk to your guides.” He also kind of communicated, at first, like, “Yeah, that’s what they all say.” I said, “No, I’m serious.” I remember him communicating, “It’s difficult in a way you’ve never known. It’s very difficult in a new way.” At the time, I was ignorant to how difficult it might be.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Reflections on Past Lives and a Break from Incarnation" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Reflections_on_Past_Lives_and_a_Break_from_Incarnation"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Reflections on Past Lives and a Break from Incarnation</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian reflects on reconnecting with the being after many lives and enjoying a blissful break before choosing to incarnate again." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_reflects_on_reconnecting_with_the_being_after_many_lives_and_enjoying_a_blissful_break_before_choosing_to_incarnate_again."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian reflects on reconnecting with the being after many lives and enjoying a blissful break before choosing to incarnate again.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, okay, then I lived many lives, and I found him again later. I shared with him some of what I had done, and I said something to the effect of, “See, I’m partway through this journey.” He was encouraging.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so then I’m going to jump a bit. The majority of this pre-life memory is of a time that is somewhat immediately preceding this life right now. I had taken a long break. I remember being in a state where it was like being on a long weekend and being reluctant to give it up. I remember frolicking, sailing, and flying through this realm of gold, reveling in the bliss of being and in the deep peace and relaxation of that. I was doing certain activities that I’m not going to try to put words on from here because I think that automatically does them a disservice. They’re higher in nature—creative activities and activities of communication with others.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember this guy coming to me over and over and saying, “Are you ready to go back yet?” And I just kept putting him off, like, “No, I’m not ready yet.” But he kept reminding me of my own intention, like, “Are you ready now? See, you’re doing this. Are you ready to go back?” Finally, I said, “Okay, I’m ready. I’m ready to go back. I’m ready for that deep challenge again.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember reviewing with him what I can only describe as my state—who I was, who I’d been. It’s really hard to describe this, but it’s kind of like… imagine this is a really poor metaphor… imagine if you looked at a chart with a graph, like a bar graph or something. This is super crude, but I reviewed through it all these qualities that I had experienced or that I had been, and I understood it was about knowing them at a deep level of who I really was.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There was one that was glaringly obvious, like, “Oh, I really need to do something about that.” It was like the super deep fear that had vested me in a previous experience. In this previous life, I had been overcome by this fear, and it led me down a path where I was a very damaging person. I was very hurtful to others. By the end of that life, I ended up dying in a painful, agonizing death because of the fear. The fear led me into a place where I eventually died physically in a painful way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I couldn’t believe the depth of this fear. It was such a low vibration. It was so distant from Source for me. It was almost unspeakably low vibration. I remember reviewing it and knowing, “Wow, if I can meet that and integrate that, I knew there would be an expansion of being possible—an expansion of myself and an expansion of all that is, too, because I’m a part of it. We’re all part of the whole.” So, I knew that it would be an incredible service if I could meet this experience and fully integrate it and heal through that at that depth. If I could do that, I knew the expansion would be so beautiful and incredible.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Even then, I could see that it was so daunting. I remember asking, “Is it even possible? Has any being in all of creation ever engaged successfully with something this low vibration?” I was shown yes, and I was told, “You have all the time available to you to do so. You don’t have to do it all at once. All of time is given to you to do this.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was super excited, and I said, “Okay, I’m going to do it.” It seems strange to me as a human to say that because, here, it’s super hard. But from that perspective, I remember knowing my strength. I knew what we are—the immortal, unharmable, loving, powerful nature of who we are. So, I thought, “Then I’ll do it.”  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Accepting the Veil and Initial Resistance" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Accepting_the_Veil_and_Initial_Resistance"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Accepting the Veil and Initial Resistance</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian accepts the veil for his current life but reacts with fear in the womb, aborting the first attempt." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_accepts_the_veil_for_his_current_life_but_reacts_with_fear_in_the_womb,_aborting_the_first_attempt."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian accepts the veil for his current life but reacts with fear in the womb, aborting the first attempt.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They brought me a life for this purpose. I reviewed that life, and I accepted that life. I accepted the veil. So, for that life now… okay, the veil is just a word we use, but this is the part that is on the forefront of my mind almost every day because the sensation of accepting the veil is very extreme. For me, I experienced it like diving into a deep, dark pool or something, having this plummet in vibration.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I like to describe it like an amplifier—a sound amplifier. It makes it pitch, and then you turn it down, and then you turn it down to the bottom, and then you keep going and turn it down more and more and more and more, and then some more, and then more still. That’s what it felt like in the body of my being—to come from that place of all connectedness and bliss and total freedom down, down, down, down, down, down, down. It’s just a breathtaking dive, like a plummet down into a place that felt comparatively like a vacuum—a place that had no heat, no air. It just felt empty and simultaneously super dense, like being shoved inside a small metal can or something like that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I went through this experience, and then I was in the womb for this life. But within seconds, I reacted very strongly in fear because every life I was aware of has a unique vibrational place—a vibrational destination or a point of perspective. This life had a very, very low vibrational perspective. So, within moments of being there, I was like, “I am not doing this. This is ridiculous. I am not doing this. This is so dark. I am not myself. I don’t feel like myself anymore. I’m not doing this.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I promptly mustered my might, my full strength, and I fought my way out. I smoked the veil. I could feel the veil, and I basically pushed out past it and threw it. I was successful in doing so, but I had killed the fetus. I killed the body that was to be mine.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I had a life review for that super short life, and I became aware of how my fear—even though I had all these big, good intentions—right at the beginning, before I was even born, how my fear had affected the mother. I became aware that the mother was heaped in sorrow, and because of her sorrow, hundreds of other people were negatively impacted by my fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">From that side, you know that all is well. There’s actually no real problem, but I was also very disappointed in myself. I could see it very clearly, like, “Oh, man, I can’t believe I did that. I can’t believe I have that much fear.” That’s really what the recognition was—like, “I am not evolved in this way. I’ve not integrated this experience yet.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I spent some time in a room that can best be described as a veil acceptance simulator. It’s like a pretend veil where you can get in the pool metaphorically, and it’s like being dunked under the water. They put this mock veil over you, except in there, you can cry uncle. You can say, “I want out. This is too much.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember doing that and practicing that. The real thing is a lot more difficult than the simulator. It was helpful, but it wasn’t as extreme as the real deal.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Planning the Second Life Attempt" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Planning_the_Second_Life_Attempt"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Planning the Second Life Attempt</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian evaluates a new life plan, less optimal but suitable, to face a trauma and address his fear." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_evaluates_a_new_life_plan,_less_optimal_but_suitable,_to_face_a_trauma_and_address_his_fear."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian evaluates a new life plan, less optimal but suitable, to face a trauma and address his fear.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so I had wasted that first life opportunity, but I still wanted to do this. I still had the same intention. So, they brought me a second life—this life. I reviewed it in great detail, and I knew that this life was not as appropriate as the first one would have been. I can’t put a number on it, but I said in one previous video where I shared this experience that that life was like a 99, and this one was like an 86 or 87 percent—something like that. Making up numbers is not like that, but it was kind of like that. This life was pretty good. It wasn’t perfect, but it did offer the correct circumstance set and constraint set for my intention.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I reviewed what can only be described as a vast flowchart of millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold and what it would be like to be me as Christian, the human. It wasn’t primarily about events. It was primarily about what it would feel like to be me in exactly this place. It was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side, and you started at the trunk, and it went out to branches. It was kind of like that. There were high probabilities to start, and there were certain thick trunk branches that would very likely go all the way to the end. There were some side branches that were a lot less likely, but it was millions of possibilities that I reviewed all at once. It was not hard to do so. I reviewed it all within moments.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was super excited. I knew that a trauma would likely befall me in my early 20s that would crush me and allow me to have the opportunity to experience this extremely low vibration fear. I was super excited. Now, as a human, it gives the ego pause, but at the time, I was super excited to do this.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember there having to be a moment to accept. I don’t remember that moment, but I do remember then being in a period where I was basically waiting for the very beginning. I was in this kind of holding area, this waiting room. I remember all of a sudden this guy coming to me like, “Okay, go now.” It was like a slap of, “Get going. Right now, you’ve got to get on Earth.” I could feel that in order to engage Earth correctly from that time to this time, it was like, “Now. Right now.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, the next memory I have is being with these guys that I can only describe as technicians or tinkerers. They were these beings that are technical in nature. I don’t know how to describe them other than their very nature is very almost mechanical, but in a way with consciousness technology or something. It’s hard to explain.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, they did this thing for me where they basically prepared the veil for me because the soul has certain qualities and a certain nature, and the life and the body have certain things going on. They do this thing where they make it all fit for the veil. So, then I was with them in this area. I remember seeing what looked like a huge pit that I was about to dive in. That was like the final moment—this is it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember they asked me one last time, “Are you sure you want to do this?” because I knew that once I said yes here, I was in for the ride. There was no going back. This is like once you press this button, you’re strapped in for the duration of the ride. You cannot get off the roller coaster.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I said yes, and then I remember once again the veil coming over me and this plummet in vibration—down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more, lower still, more, lower, lower, lower. This time, I was just trying not to fight it. I was just choosing to allow the experience to the best that I could, to surrender my control sufficiently.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I waited there for a while, and I felt fear again. So, I sent a little ping back to the technicians, like, “Did it take?” And they came back with, “Yes.” I was feeling relieved, actually. I was like, “Okay, I’m here now. I did it. I made it.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was there for a while, and then after a while, I said, “You know what? I’m not doing this. This is not happening. This is so dark. This is ridiculous. I’m not subjecting myself to this. No way.” So, once again, I began to muster my might to fight my way out.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Divine Reassurance in the Womb" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Divine_Reassurance_in_the_Womb"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Divine Reassurance in the Womb</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian experiences a profound divine intervention in the womb, affirming his eternal nature and calming his fear." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_experiences_a_profound_divine_intervention_in_the_womb,_affirming_his_eternal_nature_and_calming_his_fear."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian experiences a profound divine intervention in the womb, affirming his eternal nature and calming his fear.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As I did that, the most beautiful, holy moment happened for me. This moment is the most holy moment of my whole life. I felt the Spirit of God come to me and say—that’s not language, but it was like the depth of my being was shown to me again. I felt the stars and the galaxies, and I felt all that we are. I felt the churning bliss of the sun, and I felt the rich bliss of being. I don’t know how else to say it. I knew that I was all of that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">God said to me, “This is still what you are. You can never not be this.” It’s so personal to me, but it’s what we really are. We come here to be human, but we are far, far more. We have entered very, very deeply into this veiled experience. We forget who we are. We don’t have full knowledge right now. We don’t remember. We don’t have conscious access most of the time. It seems very rigorous, but we don’t have that access to the rest of what we are. But we still are that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Whenever I think of that, I’m just very deeply humbled because the vastness, the beauty, and the perfection of that Source from which we come is beyond words. To be known and seen by it is… anyway, I can’t put words on it. It’s just the stuff of what we are. It’s the stuff of life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, anyway, so that calmed me. I was like, “Oh, that’s still what I am. That’s wonderful.” It relaxed me because it was like, “Oh, I don’t have to fight. Okay.” So, I let go into the simple existence of being in the womb.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was there for a while, and then my next memory is of being born. I remember the pain, the shock, the temperature, the touching, the lights, and having this very shocking experience, but not having any intellectual context for it at all. I had no knowledge. I had no understanding at all. I was just experiencing something extreme—this birth event.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I have only one visual image memory of that day, and it’s actually from the room. I don’t remember where I was, but I remember the whole room—where the bed was, where the window was, where the heating vent was. I remember being intensely curious, like, “Where am I?” I remember looking at the nurses that were there and the other people in the room. I didn’t know what they were. I didn’t know anything. I just knew, “Oh, they’re taking care of me. This is beautiful. What’s happening? Why do I hurt? What is this cold?” And then someone cutting my body—a certain incision. I remember, “Oh, that’s not fun. What is that?” It was a super foreign and alien feeling.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Childhood Assumptions and Realizations" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Childhood_Assumptions_and_Realizations"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Childhood Assumptions and Realizations</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian, as a young child, assumes others feel his emotions and authority figures are wise, only to discover Earth’s differences." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian,_as_a_young_child,_assumes_others_feel_his_emotions_and_authority_figures_are_wise,_only_to_discover_Earth’s_differences."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian, as a young child, assumes others feel his emotions and authority figures are wise, only to discover Earth’s differences.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But that was it. After that, I don’t have any memory for a while. I have some really vague memories as a baby, like looking up at the dangly thing in the crib and crying for my mother. But it wasn’t until a few years later, when I was older, that I remember having this pre-birth memory at least in pieces.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember assuming that everybody did. I remember assuming things from the other reality would be true here. For instance, I assumed that we would be able to feel each other’s emotions here because that’s very normal in higher systems. We share our feeling, our thinking, and our being. There’s no room for misunderstanding. We just share what we are, and that includes feeling.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I shared this in other videos as well, but I remember being a small child who was young enough that I still had a diaper on. I had just learned how to walk. My parents had a neighbor friend over to the house, and I remember the neighbor standing there in the room. I asked her to watch me dance. There was this funky music on the music player, and I remember shaking my little tush at the couch, assuming that she would just feel as awesome and funky as I did because I’m sharing my funkiness with her, right? But she just walked away unimpressed.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It dawned on me at that moment, “She can’t feel what I’m feeling.” When I realized that, I was like, “Where the heck am I? What is this place where we can’t feel each other’s emotions? What is going on? This is crazy. It’s very strange.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another assumption I had was that beings of higher authority in our culture would be beings of greater love and wisdom because, in the other systems, there’s something of a hierarchy where beings of greater love and wisdom have positions of authority, assistance, and help—guides. They’re lovely.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, guess what? Here is not necessarily how it works. I remember thinking, “Boy, if someone’s teaching a classroom in a school, they must be very loving and wise. If someone is the mayor of a city, they must be really loving and wise. If someone is the president of the United States, they must be the most loving, wise, caring, patient person in the world.” That’s not how it works on Earth. That’s not how it works.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Rediscovery Through Meditation" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Rediscovery_Through_Meditation"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Rediscovery Through Meditation</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian’s pre-birth memories resurface at age 30 through meditation and out-of-body experiences, initially kept private." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian’s_pre-birth_memories_resurface_at_age_30_through_meditation_and_out-of-body_experiences,_initially_kept_private."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian’s pre-birth memories resurface at age 30 through meditation and out-of-body experiences, initially kept private.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I feel like even to that, I still have to remind myself that certain things are just not how it works here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so that’s a summary. Again, these things are very difficult to put into words. I feel like as the memory returns… okay, so the memory returned to me at the age of 30 after I had taken up a long-term meditation practice. I began to have out-of-body experiences, and they were very eye-opening for me because when you have these experiences in the non-physical, they are not subtle. They are ridiculously more real than this, and they can be very shocking to one’s worldview and perspective.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I began to have those experiences, and I didn’t speak about my pre-birth memory for the first seven or eight years. I was around the age of 30 when it returned. I didn’t talk about this until about the age of 38. I’m 41 now. I didn’t talk about it because I just didn’t feel like the time was right. I felt like it wouldn’t be well-received, and it just didn’t intuitively sense right. Also, of course, this is the kind of thing you don’t really talk about if you want to be perceived as a normal person. I’m a working professional adult. This is the kind of thing you don’t normally share.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But a few years ago, I felt intuitively, “Okay, the ground is fertile. The time is right. It’s time to start reminding each other and sharing.” So, that’s what I’m doing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> Well, I feel like I’ve been through an incredible experience with you.

I have probably heard from 40 or 50 other pre-birth experiencers. Some of their recollection is very similar to what I experienced. It’s so fun. I love connecting with pre-birth experiencers because I feel like we’ve made it. We’re here. We made it this far. Look at where we are, guys. We’re out in the wilderness. We’re in the weeds, and we’re bumping fists a little bit now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">People say, “Oh, you have so much memory. I’m so veiled.” It’s so good to have that interaction with those who also have a glimmer because there’s just a resonance—a vibrational resonance—meeting those people. I even met one woman who said she was listening to one of my other videos where I discussed the veil acceptance simulator, and she remembers the same thing. She said when she heard it, she pulled off the side of the road because she couldn’t believe she had heard it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">She approached me, and I love hearing that because I’ve never heard anybody else say that. I remember it, but I’ve never heard anybody else talk about that. This woman said, “It’s exactly like that—like diving into a deep, dark pool, and you can get out if you need to.” Oh my gosh, it’s so cool to be able to have that connection.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I’ve probably met 40 or 50 other people over the last three years. It’s amazing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> It must be so validating too to hear that—to have a shared experience where you can actually remember. Because, to talk about it and have someone like me say, “I know what you’re saying is right. I don’t know where I know that from, but I know that’s correct.” But to have someone actually remember it with their brain, it must be so validating to hear that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, it’s interesting you say that because I suppose it is somewhat validating, but it’d be a little bit like somebody saying, “You see the sky, and somebody else tells you they see the sky too. Now you feel validated that you’ve seen the sky.” I just don’t need validation because I know what I experienced.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But it is really… okay, so there is a higher, bigger picture going on here that is very consistent. I relate very much to near-death experiencers—people who have died and come back. They’re far more common to interact with than pre-birth memory people. I love near-death experiences. I feel like every time I have a conversation with a near-death experiencer, it’s like we can skip the first 20 letters of the alphabet and go straight to the end and really engage and be authentic. It’s okay. We can be whoever we are. We don’t need to be fake. If I’m feeling a certain way, I can feel it. I don’t need to put on a face.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That authenticity is beautiful. So, I love that shared meeting because there really is a larger context going on here that is verifiable. Earth is experiencing a lot of belief right now. We have belief systems that are very deep. I’m not knocking belief systems. Belief systems have a very important place for many people, but there is a bigger truth that transcends earthly belief. It really is real, and it is personally investigatable.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That’s why I feel meditation is extremely helpful for that because what do we investigate? Well, it’s not a whole bunch of new ideas like we’re entertaining right now while we’re listening to this video. It’s our awareness itself—our consciousness itself. Rigorously, very alert investigation—no labels, no stories. Just go look. Spend time every day without expectation, looking at your awareness itself.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Over time, as you do that, the dreamlike nature of thinking will become more and more apparent. The thoughts lose their oomph. They lose their hold, and as that happens, the ego stories begin to lose their hold, which means fears might come up, and that’s okay. But as we meet everything that we actually are experiencing—everything that is actually happening—as we go closer to what is real—awareness itself—larger parts of ourselves rise up all on their own. It’s not like we have to go get them. It’s just what we are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I feel like that’s a really important message because I want to remind people that that’s possible and that we are more. The truth is beautiful, wonderful, and good. The truth of what we are—which is not just a religious belief or a fairy tale—I know it seems super distant from Earth sometimes because we are engaging in an extremely low vibrational experience by comparison, but the truth is so good, so freeing, so wonderful that even the taste of it is…  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There is nothing to fear here on Earth. There is nothing to fear, and I’ve come to face fear. I face fear. I know fear, so I don’t say it lightly because I know the deep challenge of being human. I’m not making light of that, but there is nothing to fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That is absolutely true, and that’s not just a nice-sounding, “Oh, that sounds so nice, but my life is horrible.” No, underneath the labels and the stories of “life is horrible” or “the world is in such a state” or “I am weak” or all these stories, underneath it all, the bedrock of what we are—consciousness itself—is always, always full of love, joy, and freedom. That is a beautiful thing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I went on a long tangent there, but I feel like that’s exactly right. I hope that people take that in and really hear that for what it is because I think that is the message. We are so much more than just this.

Maybe there are other ways to learn things, but it almost feels like you came across him, and it’s like, “This is what we think you’d be good for. This is what you could do.” Do you think it was kind of like that—a recruiting kind of thing, like, “You’re the kind of spirit who could do well on Earth”?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> No, okay, no, not at all. No, I was not recruiting. This is long ago. I know what you’re saying, but no, he was… I was almost pestering him. Okay, I mean, it’s not truly pestering, but I’m saying that I was… he was doing something else, and I came across him. We were with other beings as well, but he stood out.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was persistent in my interest because of what I saw in the nature of who he was. What’s interesting is that I shared this in several videos, and this is another thing I hadn’t really heard anybody talk about before—being inspired by another being. But then, about a year ago, I came across a Robert Monroe video. He’s an out-of-body explorer with the Monroe Institute, and he actually said something to the effect of, “Most of us who come here were at one point inspired by a being who has been physical because we see what expansion is possible, and we say something like, ‘Even if it takes a thousand lifetimes, I’ll do that.’”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, I relate to that. I came across this being, and I was deeply inspired to do this. Now, I do 100% agree that not all beings will choose to come to Earth. The vast, vast majority of spirit is… there are so many more spirits that are not engaged in Earth than there are on Earth. In fact, even just the guides that we have locally, I feel, outnumber the participants in the play.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We have so many characters on Earth right now. Everyone listening to this video who’s physical—there may be non-physical friends listening to this—but everyone who’s physical right now is playing a part of a character here on Earth. That’s just a metaphor. You’re being yourself. You’re being a human.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I feel that the number of guides and friends of ours—family and friends in the non-physical that participate in an indirect way or maybe a slightly direct way, helping us—they outnumber us. I want to point that out because, to us on Earth, it looks like, “Oh, there’s just billions of humans, and this is… dude, having one human lifetime—the chance to play a human—is the most precious, amazing, unique, just precious gift.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There are so many spirits in all of creation. There are so many beings available that to be given the opportunity to play a human is like, “Oh, out of all of creation, I’m being given the opportunity to be a human—this human. Oh my gosh, it’s the biggest honor.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, you may not think about that. Whoever’s listening today, and of course, I understand if you don’t remember making the choice to come, but you—out of every being—you were given the chance to be you, to be this physical hue. Just… you were given a chance. It’s just the most beautiful, remarkable, precious gift.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Being a human is especially unique, especially because Earth is just kind of a high-value, unique place. So, to play a human—one of the humans—oh my goodness, wow, what an opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> When you talk about coming… the part of your story that… because I’ve heard you talk about your experience more than one time because it’s so intriguing to me, so I’ve heard you talk on other shows about this. When you talk about the place we come from and having all of this knowledge and all this love and all this connection, and when you come down to Earth and you’re losing that and losing that and losing that, it is the most… it touches my heart in a way I can’t explain.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I know what you’re talking about, and it just… yeah, that part of the story always just gets to me, and I can just feel it because I know that’s the truth. Let me ask you this: How do you, when you think of that, bring whatever is missing now for that place and how that has been kind of… we’ve been removed from that to come here? How do you inject that into your life? What are things here that give you that little spark of… for me, it’s like laughter and music—those two things, joy and music. Those things I feel I can feel a connection—an instant connection—to my true self, to that place. So, what do you recognize here that we can hook into to feel that even a little bit and to remind us of where we come from?  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Bridging the Vibrational Gap" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Bridging_the_Vibrational_Gap"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Bridging the Vibrational Gap</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian explains how joy and love align us vibrationally with our true nature, narrowing the perceived gap created by the veil." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_explains_how_joy_and_love_align_us_vibrationally_with_our_true_nature,_narrowing_the_perceived_gap_created_by_the_veil."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian explains how joy and love align us vibrationally with our true nature, narrowing the perceived gap created by the veil.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> That’s a beautiful question. I really appreciate your comment, by the way, feeling that about the veil. All of us know on some level… okay, so I’ll just say to start that our true nature is love, joy, and freedom. So, when we engage in something here that is of joy, we immediately and instantaneously are in a vibrational alignment with what we really are. So, that bridges the gap.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It’s hard to put this in a word because you want to think about it like… I know this sounds abstract to those of us who are used to thinking in physical terms, but if you imagine a canyon—I’ll use a physical metaphor—if you imagine that the distance between there and here is like a canyon, and it’s a vibrational canyon. So, it’s a distance in vibration.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You’re not actually on this side of the canyon. What’s actually happening is you have voluntarily surrendered… okay, the veil can only function with our voluntary commitment to it. It’s not possible to be veiled against our will because the spirit is sovereign. It’s a part of Source. There’s no greater authority, so it can’t be veiled without an agreement.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, we agree to… you might want to think of the veil like a cloak that we wear, maybe, or a spacesuit that we climb into. But unlike those physical metaphors, there’s not actually a real distance. There’s only a constraint that has been placed upon consciousness itself. You are still your consciousness itself right now. That’s the key. That’s like the most important thing. I know it sounds abstract, but you are your awareness itself.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that awareness—consciousness itself—is, if you think of that as like the substance of what really is, that’s the fundamental substrate of being, of existence. So, then that consciousness beholds form—things, sensory experience, sight, sound, touch, thoughts, ideas, perceptions, beliefs—all these things.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When we entertain a perspective that is in alignment with the truth—for instance, “I am loved”—our vibration immediately matches that perception, which is much closer to the other side of the canyon. If, on the other hand, we entertain a belief like, “The world is terrible, and I have no power,” then we take a vibrational step, and the canyon actually gets wider.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But the thing is, it’s not really there. What the veil has done is allowed us to entertain these many perspectives because where else can you entertain this perspective of being powerless or being stuck in pain or being unworthy or whatever else? Where else can you do that other than here?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I say all that as a background to your question because when we… we are already love, freedom, and joy—always, always, always. We just get covered up in gunk—all the form association, all the pain of our lives, all the limitations, all the bodily limitations, the neurological limitations, the biochemical limitations. But all of that is subordinate to the spirit.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, when you, as spirit, entertain an experience that is for you beautiful and loving or fun—even just fun—your vibration immediately moves back toward what you normally are because you are now entertaining a perception that is much closer to the truth. Fearful perceptions are not ultimately true, even though so very much of the decision-making we make on Earth currently is based on fear—based on ego, which comes from fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are all making decisions every day to protect ourselves, to try to get ahead of the next guy, to improve our image, to try to avoid the things we’re afraid of, to avoid our pain, avoid our pain, avoid our pain—just keep avoiding our pain. We do all these things, but our true nature is always love, joy, and freedom.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, the answer is… from my man, I just say my comment to your question is: For you, whatever brings you joy, whatever you see beauty in, that brings you closer to your true spiritual nature already. But then, simultaneously, if you’re talking about something in the world, that would be my comment. But I want to say, as a more fundamental statement, you can also investigate your awareness itself through meditation—not to go get happiness, but because happiness is what you already are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, if you spend the time personally investigating your awareness itself, the painful form associations will gradually—you need to be able to put in the time; this doesn’t happen in five minutes—gradually lose their hold on you. Beneath all that, you may find pain, but if you’re willing to face and feel all things and be completely alert, the real you is always down there, and you are already peace, joy, and love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You don’t actually need a form. You don’t actually need a thing—a person, a drug. You don’t need something. You are already that. The question is: What are you buying into that you think is so proven? Because these negative perceptions we think are proven to us time and again over the decades. “The world is obviously dark. Look, see? Look at all this terrible stuff happening in the world.”  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Our beliefs here become invisible to us so much that the world looks like our beliefs. If we believe something about the world, that’s the way the world looks. But underneath that, we put meaning on it. Underneath all that, we are love and joy.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that was kind of a long comment, but…  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> No, I think that’s great. I think it kind of keeps coming back to that same message of, “This is who we really are.” All of this stuff is like you said. I think the analogy of the play works best for me because it’s like we’re all playing characters, and then we go off stage, and everybody just resumes who we really are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Exactly. That’s exactly right. Another analogy is: At night, when you dream, and then you wake up in the morning, it’s obvious that now you’re in the real world, and that was just a dream. Well, that’s how dying is. It’s just obvious. It’s so much more real. It’s more lucid. You know more about yourself. That was the dream.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, do you need to really get worked up? No. And while you’re here in the play, guess what? We’re allowed to have fun. It’s just a play. You don’t have to take things too seriously. We’re super serious as humans. Everything’s so serious. It’s actually not that serious. You can have joy and peace in all circumstances if you so choose.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Intent and Impact in the Play of Life" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Intent_and_Impact_in_the_Play_of_Life"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Intent and Impact in the Play of Life</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian reflects on the balance between life’s play-like nature and the serious impact of intent in actions, acknowledging his own flaws." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_reflects_on_the_balance_between_life’s_play-like_nature_and_the_serious_impact_of_intent_in_actions,_acknowledging_his_own_flaws."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian reflects on the balance between life’s play-like nature and the serious impact of intent in actions, acknowledging his own flaws.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> It’s interesting because when you talk about it not being so serious, that really everything is okay, and when you talk about the experience of the first experience that you kind of feel like you messed up—where you were the fetus, you jumped, you’re like, “I’m done,” and then you saw this small life that you had and the ripple effect that it had—how does that make you feel about your own words and actions? What kind of importance do you place on it in your own life, having had that experience and knowing how the ripple effect can… that is how it is? How do you conduct yourself with the things you say, the things you think, and the things you project onto people? How do you navigate that with that knowledge?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> I have a lot of fear, and I have a lot of ego. So, the short answer is: Our quality of intent is important. That’s a term from Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In my own case, I try to honestly appraise the quality of my intent. Why am I doing what I’m doing right now? Why am I saying what I’m saying? Why am I doing this activity that I’m doing? But I’m not a special person. I’m deeply flawed. I’m going to ask my wife. She has to tolerate many difficulties that I bring to bear. I have a lot of fear, and she has to live with that too.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I’m just saying that up front because that’s just how it is. But okay, so when you were asking the question, I understand you asked it on the tail of the comment that we don’t need to take things too seriously, but yet everything we do here on Earth is important. So, those two things can seem like they’re opposites, but this is a good example of, in the spiritual context, two things can appear opposite but are both simultaneously very much true because of where we are in duality.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It gets confusing trying to pick, “Well, which one is it?” because we like A or B—hot or cold, up or down, left or right. Which one is it? It’s both. All is well, and we don’t have to take anything too seriously ever, and yet it’s very important what we do and how we affect each other.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are here to actualize love. We’re here to be love, and that can mean all sorts of things. It’s not just one type of behavior. I think especially in certain religious traditions, we try to codify what loving intent means. It’s this thing and not that thing. We always do this, and we never do this. Love is much bigger than that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Love can mean all sorts of different things in all sorts of different circumstances. It can mean, in many cases, peace in the face of great violence. Sometimes it may mean standing up and taking action that may even appear violent in order to protect someone or do the best that we can in the play where we see it needs to be done.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We might need to choose assertiveness, or we might need to step back and accept. There’s a spectrum for all these kinds of decisions. One of the essays I wrote in the book is called “Loving Intent Transcends All Axes.” What I mean is, in all these spectrums—should I do this or this? Should I be this way or this way?—love can operate through both or in the middle.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, we develop as spirits not just our ability to choose one or the other end of the spectrum, but we also improve our ability to choose which end of the spectrum and when. So, we improve not only our strength in some direction—like, say, bravery—but we also work on when to choose to deploy or bring forward that quality.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Discernment is the other big thing we’re working to do. What discernment am I talking about? Not just discernment about looking at things in the correct way. I’m talking about discernment of intention—what intention are we bringing to bear in this certain circumstance?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The good news is, this is so important in the context of your question: The quality of our intention in the smallest moment is what matters. It’s what’s so powerful. The ability to, in this—it may appear to be such a small, tiny thing on the Earth’s surface—but to the spirit, to bring love to bear, or to face one’s fears, or to face one’s grief, or to face one’s addiction, or whatever other thing we’re here to deal with—in the smallest way, to improve ourselves in the smallest way, is incredibly powerful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Those are the celebrated moments of our lives. It’s not how many objects we moved around or how much money we made. None of that’s going to matter. That’s all play. It’s play content. It’s props on the stage. What matters is: Who are you? What have you done in a simple moment?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It does not have to be physically moving a mountain. There’s a beautiful near-death experience I forget whose this was, but there was a gentleman who shared that he had an NDE, and he died. He had a life review, and he became aware that one of the most celebrated moments of his entire life was when he was a child. He was on a road trip with his family, and they stopped at some rest stop. His parents asked him to go down to this river nearby and get a bucket of water because they didn’t have water.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, he was carrying this bucket of water back to the car, and he decided to go out of his way to water a dry tree. He let some of the water out of his way, so it took him a little bit of effort. He watered this tree, brought the bucket up to his parents, and never thought of it again. That was the most beautiful, celebrated moment of his life because he did it out of love and selflessness and just joy—not because there was any way he could benefit. In fact, it was a little bit difficult for him, and he did it anyway.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Similarly, here, you can be a paraplegic in your own bed. You can’t move a finger, but you are a powerful spirit. It doesn’t matter that you can’t move a finger. That’s a play. It’s not really what you are. What you are is the beautiful consciousness who is in this experience now, who gets to choose. Can you meet this with love and openness and acceptance right now?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The smallest moment—that is where the power is. The small, beautiful moments of just meeting our own fear, choosing compassion, choosing vulnerability, choosing to own our own crap in a simple way—that is where the rubber meets the road.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that’s a long-winded answer to your question, but I think for everybody, that is going to mean something different. For everybody, that means something different. For some people, it depends on what we’re here to face and what our challenges are. Everybody has different challenges.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We look like we’re all together on the surface, and most people are pretty… most people have a lot of pain going on. How do you meet that pain? How do you honor yourself? How do you honor the person next to you? How do you decide? How do you identify when your intention is not the best it can be?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">How do you choose joy in the midst of this context? Are you so calloused over by life that you can’t dance with the child who’s playing next to you any longer, or can you dance? Those are the beautiful choices because what survives is spirit, which is consciousness.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The context goes away. It’s going to be gone, but what you retain is the experience and the choices you made while you were here. What kind of choices did you make? It’s not about the size of the context. It’s about the quality of even the smallest choices.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Collective Awakening and Facing Old Beliefs" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Collective_Awakening_and_Facing_Old_Beliefs"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Collective Awakening and Facing Old Beliefs</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian describes humanity’s awakening, confronting old thought momentum like racism, and the individual’s role in raising collective vibration." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_describes_humanity’s_awakening,_confronting_old_thought_momentum_like_racism,_and_the_individual’s_role_in_raising_collective_vibration."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian describes humanity’s awakening, confronting old thought momentum like racism, and the individual’s role in raising collective vibration.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> I love that, Christian. I love that. But I want to kind of wrap this up in a bigger spiritual question way, I guess, and ask you: I told you about the way everybody that is watching this knows how I started the channel and started this journey for myself in this direction. You’re here having this conversation, and you’ve talked to other people. What is happening? What is it?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What is happening with all of this? It seems so… in such a very… to me, a very… maybe the last 20 years where it’s almost like we’re allowed to have all this information on Earth now, or it’s coming to us in different ways. What is that? What do you think is happening as far as… is the Earth ready for it? Is it a planned kind of thing, like, “Okay, we’re going to have more spirit energy here now,” or “We’re going to have more communication,” or are there just more people here that have done this so many times that they’re not that surprised anymore by the fact that there is more to this? They just kind of instinctively know because we’ve been here so many times now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What is going on? What do you think is going on?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Well, I think that the human kind collective consciousness is going through what we call the awakening. It’s just a term. Basically, each one of us is a part of the collective consciousness of humanity, which is a group, but it’s also its own thing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The collective consciousness goes through certain high-level acts of the play, and we entertain certain types of experience for certain durations, which on Earth may seem like very long durations. We’re at a point now where we are shifting, and we are attempting to reach a higher vibration as a collective.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But in order to do that, it means a lot of the old crap that we have been very deeply associated with for a long time has to be faced and felt and healed. So, the collective consciousness of humanity has built up a lot of thought momentum. What I mean by that is, in the astral and higher realms, thoughts are like physical objects that you can interact with.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, when you’ve got thousands of years of human thinking one thing, there’s a lot of thought momentum in that direction. So, we are dealing with the historical momentum of the species and the Earth. That whole sea has a lot of very low vibration, previously entertained experiences and perceptions in it—a lot of very old beliefs that are just deeply rooted within us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Take one for instance that’s very dear in my heart—racism. Racism is an example. It’s just a simple ego trick of believing in validating the self by validating one’s group at the expense of others. It’s very simple, and it’s a reflection of fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that’s just one example of a pattern that is in the collective consciousness of humanity that we are in the process of undoing. In order to undo it, the higher vibrational energies that come in tend to prompt us to face that crap, and it means that there can be some strong last hurrahs.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I personally feel we’ve experienced some of that in the United States in the last five years, and that happens because there are still a lot of people who hold on to those beliefs that have a lot of thought momentum.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, there are non-physical beings helping us to bring higher energy into this system, but there’s friction as that happens because now we need to actually… now the rubber has to meet the road. Now that the higher vibration is here, we’re either going to grow—which means face our own fear—and growth is love, or not.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, who’s growing? This is super important. Individuals. We’re talking about the collective, but it’s individuals. It’s every person listening right now and everybody else—one at a time—doing their best to meet this experience with love rather than fear and ego and the belief that rises by the ego.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It’s an individual process. I’m a fan of the quote—I forget the exact words—but it’s something like, “At first, I was clever, so I tried to change the world. Now I’m wise, so I changed myself.” The idea is that you don’t have to worry about anybody else. You simply choose how you meet your experience and how you interact with those around you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Most of us have a lot more fear than we’re willing to… so there is a lot of work for each individual to do, typically. But the good news is, one person who awakens—one person who discovers who they are, meets their own crap, who really is authentic even for a time—is much more powerful than many who are lost in the dream of fearful thoughts.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An awakened person is powerful, including the collective consciousness. It’s like a beacon of light in the sea that attracts others. If you imagine a big pool of water and there’s lights going on, the more that go on, the more the rest of them stay like, “Oh, look, the lights are changing,” even though they may not be consciously aware of it. It gives permission to everybody else.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An individual who is awakened tends to shine very brightly and has more power because love is the true power. Fear has no real power. Love has incredible power, even if you physically can’t do anything at all.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, as we choose love and try to bring love into our personal experience, we help bring that vibration of love into this place, and the collective will grow. I personally am very hopeful. I know a lot of people are very fearful about the prospects and what appears on the surface, but I actually feel that the vibration is increasing, and we are doing better.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I have a lot of hope for our goal, our destination. It may not happen in a year, but it doesn’t need to happen in a human lifetime. We’re not one lifetime anyway.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Closing Thoughts and Resources" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Closing_Thoughts_and_Resources"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Closing Thoughts and Resources</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian shares his book _A Walk in the Physical_ for free online, contact details, and a heartfelt message of love and encouragement." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_shares_his_book__A_Walk_in_the_Physical__for_free_online,_contact_details,_and_a_heartfelt_message_of_love_and_encouragement."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian shares his book <em>A Walk in the Physical</em> for free online, contact details, and a heartfelt message of love and encouragement.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> That’s right. I think a lot of people… that is the thing right there. That ego side of us wants to see it all. We want it to happen right now and see all these wonderful things happen, but you’re right. There’s no… we’re so linear. We think of such time restraints for everything. So, you’re right. That is what ultimately is like, “It’s all okay,” because this is all happening, and it will happen in its own time.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> Christian, your book is <em>A Walk in the Physical</em>. Oh my gosh, I can’t wait to read it. But tell me where else people can find you. What other stuff are you doing? Where can they find you?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Sure. So, I have a website, awalkinthephysical.com. It’s been my blog site for years. There’s a page on the site for the book. The book is available for free online. On the book page, there’s a third link down—a link to a Google Books entry for the entire book. You just click “Read for Free,” and the whole book is there.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I think it’s very important that we share this information. It’s not about money. I really want to share. The book is something that I feel is important. I worked with spirit over the years and brought forth chunks of the time. I technically wrote the book, but I feel like it was very much spirit-led.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It’s very non-linear. I’ve tried to create a reality model that is encouraging and helps remind the individual of what they already know. I have nothing new to give, but I can at least provide a framework for exploration. I think that’s something that is important.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, yeah, that’s the idea behind the book. I feel like, to be honest, the book is my life’s work. I knew I just knew I had to get it into the physical. I don’t know what’s going to happen with it. I don’t have any expectations. I just know that I needed to make it physical in the way that it is now, and I’m happy and honored to do that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As for how to contact me, my email is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a> You can also reach out on Facebook if you’d like to talk. I’m happy to talk to anybody. We just need to be there and encourage each other. All of us are brothers and sisters walking on the path.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I’m not a special person. I’m just another wilderness journeyer, but I’m happy to greet you on the path, and we can talk about the weeds. We’re both in the weeds right now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As a closing thought, I just want to say: For whoever is listening right now, please do be reminded that you are loved. You are a loving, loved, beautiful, precious, powerful being—you specifically, not just a super general love. You are known, and you are loved. There is nothing to fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I hope that you can be reminded of that as you go about your daily life, which is important and meaningful. You’re performing a great service today by being human and walking the human journey. So, thank you for doing that. I’m sure it’s been a while since someone thanked you for being human, but thank you for being human, even though you don’t remember anything else.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you for being human, and don’t take it too seriously. Just have fun, do your best to love those around you, to love yourself, and to engage the beauty of the world. Just do that. It’s a beautiful, powerful thing. This is an opportunity. We are in the opportunity right now. This moment is the opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We’ve come all this way. Everyone listening today, you’ve come a really long way through all your physical life, from journeys that you can’t even remember to now. What will we do with it?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> Yeah, make it count, but don’t take it too seriously.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Yeah, make it count in a joyful way. Be yourself. Be authentic because when we’re ourselves, it’s joyful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> Thank you so much, Christian. I just thank you so much for having me too.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Thank you. Thank you for your work.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Host:</strong> Oh, you’re more than welcome.

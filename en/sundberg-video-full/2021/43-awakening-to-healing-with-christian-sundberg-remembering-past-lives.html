Thank you so much for having me. I'm going to be brief about my pre-birth experience, as we were discussing. I think it's good to use the time to dive into other topics. But I'll just at least summarize for those who are listening today.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And before I do, I just have to disclaim every time that I try to talk about this, there are just no words that are possible to discuss these topics. Our true nature transcends the entire world of form and duality. So there's no words, which are symbols in form that are based in our local world. There's no words that can possibly even remotely touch the breadth of what we are or the quality of our higher nature. So I just really need to say that up front.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so to be very brief, I remember a very long time... Okay, so first of all, my body is 41 years old right now. When I was 30, I took up a long-term meditation practice, and I began to spontaneously have pre-birth memory returned to me. And this memory was very normal, very natural, the most natural thing in the world. Wow.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it was very eye-opening. I also began to have out-of-body experiences, and they were very shocking, very worldview-altering. And I remember you right there because yeah, I didn't hear that before, that it was spontaneous and only when you were 33. And so yeah, oh 30, sorry. But oh my God, so you were not even shocked a little bit?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Wow, no. But it's strange. Okay, so I remember when the memories returned, I remember that I had remembered them before the age of five or six, and I had forgotten them completely. And that's very normal because we are veiled while we're on Earth. That is, our consciousness is under the constraints of being physical, being biological. So the more we focus into the physical world and our identifications with it, our stories, the more we focus into that, the deeper the veil is.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so that memory that had been with me as a small child, I had no access to that at all. And also, it was important that I didn't because it allowed me to engage in an experience that was very challenging for me, that I needed to experience or wanted to experience, I should say. And that was a very traumatic experience in my 20s.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So yeah, so then when I was 30 and I took up a meditation practice, the memory began to return, and it was very normal. It was like someone had just blown leaves off of the ground or something, and it was just there's grass underneath. Oh yeah. But it's not like... but it's very, very deep and personal and rich, and not like an earthly event or something. It's very just deeply like in the substrate of my being, like who I am. But so very normal, but also very me, very personal, very known. I don't know, it's hard to explain. Very familiar.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So then ancient and yet happening now, and also very familiar. So do you remember exactly how you were born as well and how you came here, like you know what your mission was as well?  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Choosing to Incarnate**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Choosing_to_Incarnate**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Choosing to Incarnate</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian explains his pre-birth planning process, interactions with a guide, and his decision to return to physical experience despite initial resistance.

So it's not getting into the whole story.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The majority of my pre-birth memories are of a time somewhat immediately preceding this life, where I had taken a long break in between lives. And this guide kept coming to me over and over and asking me, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And putting him off for a while, and eventually saying, "Okay, I'm ready to go back."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then reviewing with this guide my state, like who I am, who had been... like reviewing my... this is really hard to describe or explain, but it's like reviewing my known qualities or something, like the areas of experience that I knew and that I had integrated and mastered, maybe you might even say.

He highlights how we perceive separation despite being inherently connected.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so okay, so while we're human, we tend to try to see the entire reality picture from our local vantage point. So while we're on Earth, we grow accustomed to thinking of reality in terms of locations, linear time, discrete location. Yes, so like I'm here and you're there, and we don't feel connected. We feel separate.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and then reality to us is a bunch of places. That's what we think reality is comprised of, places. So it's not inaccurate to think or say that. It's just that this experience that we're having here is not a primarily real place. What we're having is an experience of a place. It's more like a virtual experience, having been physical and biological.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so really, what's happening is your consciousness itself is receiving data, information, sensory information, sight, sound, touch, and you're having thoughts about it, and you're applying meaning to it. And that is your experience of the physical world. You and everybody, we're all having this experience, and it feels like a shared objective world, but it's actually not. It's actually yours and my experience. It's like the Matrix.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is like the Matrix. There's your experience and my experience and the next person's experience, and we're all having this shared experience, kind of like when you log on to a massive multiplayer online role-playing video game. You know, you sit down on your computer, you log on, everyone goes into this one shared world. Are they really in that world? No, not really.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Right, but in this case, the reason I say that in the context of your question is there is no distance. There is no actual such thing as separation or distance. We are all connected right now. It's just that we've agreed to have the experience of being veiled from all of what we are so that we can have this, we could even say, artificial experience of separation because it has great, incredible potential in it. There's an incredible opportunity being human.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Growth Through Contrast**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Growth_Through_Contrast**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Growth Through Contrast</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian explains the purpose of experiencing suffering, challenges, and limitations.

He likens life to weightlifting or climbing Everest—difficult but ultimately rewarding for personal and spiritual growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So we agree to sign up for the constraints so that we can have this very specific experience of this very specific vantage point. So would it be correct if I would take this metaphor because I love metaphors, right? So there's this mouse, he's born in like, say, this little cage where there is, you know, his life village, everybody else, and all that. But outside of that cage, there's so much more, but obviously, the mouse doesn't know.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so right, is that a bit what it's like then?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, yeah. The physical universe is a very, very small portion of what is. It's a very defined, highly specific type of experience. We are experiencing a deep state of separation right now that is quite unusual, quite alien and unique. You know, we're experiencing a state where we actually don't know for certain that we are unconditionally loved. We don't remember all the rest of what we are. We don't even know if we're going to survive death.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, right? When you just look at the physical, I mean, you know, you see a body die, and wow, that's the end. That's what it looks like on the surface because what you can see doesn't exist right in our concepts, say. But obviously, we are evolving a bit, at least those that wake up, and we know. But we can still see, so it's about trusting it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I just simply meant that when because we can't see the larger reality systems directly from the human personality's point of view, that is, from this character's point of view, because we can't see it, it makes this reality have an incredible opportunity because we're at such an extreme point of perspective here, feeling this separate and this cut off. Like, we don't feel the unconditional love that exists for us every waking moment here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and that is a very strange thing, actually, in the bigger context. It's a very unique thing to be in that constraint set. Such an unusual advantage to it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, and what's the advantage? Because now I'm really curious. Okay, so I'll jump into that. Do you... I'll jump into that. We can come back if you'd like to the rest of the story, but I think this is more important to talk about actually because I don't think that sharing my experience is that important. I think it's more important to talk to this very topic.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, actually, let me put the video that you did with Buddha at the gas station pump in the description for those that want to watch the whole story from the beginning because he's done so many interviews. I didn't want to repeat and repeat. It would be boring, and we need new information. So there you go. Yeah, okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All right, so this is extremely difficult to describe, but there are some pretty good metaphors that we have. So I'll try to speak to your question with some metaphors.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Overcoming Fear and Choosing Love**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Overcoming_Fear_and_Choosing_Love**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Overcoming Fear and Choosing Love</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian discusses the nature of fear and how it arises from separation.

He explains the importance of meeting challenges with love and acceptance rather than resistance.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so if you were, let's say, on the couch, and I've used this metaphor before, so I apologize if it's a repeat, but let's say you're on your living room couch, and you're watching TV, and you've got like good access to the snacks, you know, and everything is comfortable and wonderful and good, right? Why would you ever voluntarily get up off the couch and say, go outside and go for a run?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, why would you ever do that? To experience it, and not only just to experience it, but because you grow in strength, and you grow, you live in a rich and full way. And then when you return to the couch, it's actually comfortable in a way that you may not have been able to appreciate before. You know, because now you know what it's like to be under stress, and you're stronger, and you come back and you sit on the couch like, "Wow, this is a nice couch now."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, this is a very crude metaphor. Well, actually, it's like having a job that is really stressful and annoying and all that, so you actually appreciate your spare time. And so that's kind of what it's like then. It's about appreciation of what you have if you didn't have it. It's something like that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's that the entire system of contrast is used by spirit in order to expand what it is and to evolve. So the name of the game of what we're here to do is to grow in love. We're here to grow our beings towards love, and we're here to integrate experience. That's what we're here to do. We're here to have this perspective and make choices while we're here, make choices, and then see how it turns out, and to try to grow who we actually are towards love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so if we can do that here, the thing is here the constraints are very high, and especially in certain circumstances, the constraints can be extremely high. And so if we can bring to bear a loving intent here rather than a fear-based intent, there is a profound growth and a profound expansion in what we are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So to use another metaphor, it's like, let's say you're laying there, and you're totally weightless and free, and then someone comes over and says, "I can put this big heavy weighted blanket on you, and let's see how you can walk with this blanket on." Right? So then you put on this blanket, you stand, you barely move, you know, you stand up, you can barely move, and now you try to perform some physical feat or something with this heavy blanket on you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That is a little bit like what we're doing here. We accept these incredible constraints. And I mean, the physical world is not bad. There's nothing negative about this experience. In fact, it's a neutral experience. We apply the meaning to it. That's a big part of what we're doing here is we're learning how to deal with our own consciousness, our own tendencies, and our own processes, and how we apply meaning and what meaning we apply to the world. And then we live with that meaning that we apply and the beliefs that we buy into.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And everything that we do with our experience, both externally and internally, we learn from, we grow from. Well, it's like solving a puzzle, but you don't know the pieces.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, it's a little like that, except the goal is not to rearrange the objects in some way so that now we've got a good world going. Well, not really. The Earth, the physical experience, the entire physical reality is virtual anyway. It's a stage, a play. It's you know, we can move around the props all we like. It's not really that real.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So what is real? What's real is you, your consciousness, and mine. And so the consciousness that knows the experience operates through it. It operates through context, and the way that it does that, if it's more so if it can operate in a way that is more in alignment with its true nature, which is loving, rather than fearful, fear being more in alignment with the illusion of separation, you know, that we don't like it, we respond, we protect only the self, we hurt others, the ego rises up and does whatever it can to protect us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If we align with that, you know, that is a very painful choice, whereas if even in this extreme set of constraints, even if here, if we can bring love to bear here, you know, bring compassion, kindness, understanding, humility, if we can meet our own fear, if we can own our own place in the world, if we can meet our own pains with acceptance rather than resistance and judgment, you know, every day there's a tremendous number of ways that we choose how to meet reality.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Every day, that choosing how to meet it is what's so powerful because then that is like walking with the heavy blanket on, so to speak, because as we are able to make choices that are more love-based here, we're doing it under a difficult set of circumstances, under a difficult constraint set, and then we really grow, and we really know it, we really expand and evolve in a way that is not, I don't want to say it's not at all possible except by coming physical, but practically speaking, the only way to do it is to be physical and to do it, to actually do it.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Processing Fear and Trauma**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Processing_Fear_and_Trauma**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Processing Fear and Trauma</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian discusses the nature of fear, how unresolved trauma resurfaces for integration, and how resistance amplifies suffering.

He emphasizes meeting pain with awareness rather than judgment.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thanks to your experience, you can actually share that information, which also means that people can shift their focus to what it's really about because, at the end of the day, we are gripped by these heavy blankets, so to speak, in their lives. So that focus goes there to fight it, to try to make it as easy as possible, which always is working against us rather than for us based on what we're focused on.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And because we are focused on that, because we don't have the knowledge of what it would be otherwise, and which is what you teach us with your experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, we do. Okay, so the thing is, the deeper parts of us always know. So I'm in no way special. There is just a, it's just that the obfuscation of our conscious awareness is a common and almost necessary, typically necessary portion of the constraint set that we agree to experience here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So if we can make those loving choices, even if we don't know, even if we don't remember, with just what's in front of us, that's very powerful. In fact, I'm telling you, the opportunity to be human and to make choices in our lives here is such a profound opportunity and gift. It is unbelievably such an opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Every day, every moment, like you know, we get stuck and wrapped up in the pains of our lives and the stresses, and then, "Oh my gosh, I got this big thing going on, I got to worry about that all day." I know, I do too. I get wrapped up in it too. But even in that, can you change the momentum? I like that you mentioned the word focus because focus is a big part of what we're doing here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What do we focus on, and why? Usually, when we're afraid of something, it's difficult for us to take our focus away from it because we're so afraid. And part of the reason that happens, actually, by the way, this is just a tangent, is because as consciousness, we always seek to integrate all of our experience. So if there's something we're afraid of or we can't handle, it will tend to pop back up because it's asking to be integrated and assimilated.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so how we choose to respond is very powerful. Yeah, it's all about choice, isn't it? And so it is, even in very small ways. Like, it doesn't have to be a big, huge, "Oh my gosh, I've got to solve this huge problem, I've got to overcome this huge thing." It can sometimes be huge, Earth circumstances, but to the spirit, what matters is the quality of your intent itself, not the scope necessarily of the physical thing you're wielding an intent about.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, watering a plant could be the most wonderful thing. In fact, there's a near-death experience I've shared a couple of times, and I'm sorry, I forget the name of this near-death experience, but one gentleman who shared, I think it was a gentleman, I'm sorry, I don't remember if it was a male or female, but they shared that one of the most celebrated moments in their lives was when their family was on a road trip, and they stopped at a rest area, and this person's parents asked them to go down to this river to get a bucket of water.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And they went down and got water, and they were carrying it back to the car, and they saw a dry tree out of the way, so they went a little bit out of their way, even though it was heavy, the water was heavy, it was a little bit uncomfortable for them, but they went over and watered this tree. And then they took the water up to their car, and they never thought about it again. And that single event was one of the most celebrated moments in this person's life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It wasn't about the scope or the size. It was just that it was loving and selfless. Yeah, and so all of it, like I think so many people get so overwhelmed by the what looks like scope that can't be fixed. You know, the broken world, a broken society, a broken political system, a broken marriage, a broken family situation, you know, a broken body.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, whatever. This is so interesting. You said you don't need to worry about that. You just need to make a choice how to meet it, what to do with it. I just realized that exactly those little moments, that at that moment you do them rather automatically, you don't think about it, but they stay with you for the rest of your life. And there's many moments they think, "Oh yeah, remember that moment when I did this or that, and God, I wonder how it is with whatever," in this case, the tree, right?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it's true, those things actually are so memorable. I never thought about it until you actually mentioned it now. It's not just memorable too. There's a couple of other important points as to why that's meaningful. One is, every other being is a part of you. So when you act in love, you're actually loving another part of yourself. So love is just the most natural, wonderful, good way to actualize or manifest experience because it is an alignment with the unity of our true nature.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But the second thing is, our intent itself has an effect. Just the intent, just a thought, every thought, every intention has like a pitch or a vibration. And in certain other states of being, other states of consciousness, you can perceive it. You can hear it, feel it. You can see that the intention itself is like causing a ripple.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So the way that we meet even our own thoughts, the way that we meet the person next to us, what we prioritize this moment, it all matters. It's all very powerful. It doesn't need to be a huge, arduous scope. You know, we build up a lot of momentum in our lives, like huge amounts of momentum. We think the same thoughts for 50 years. You know, we replay the same things. We go through the same habits.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Our body remembers all of our momentum. We have thought momentum. Don't worry about the momentum actually because now, in this moment, is a chance to change the momentum, to pick something else if you wish to, to choose a choice that is more compassionate or understanding or accepting or loving, even with yourself.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and one just one other thing that comes to mind as we do that, so you might feel like, "Oh my gosh, how do I possibly choose that in this cacophony of all these thoughts and actions and things going on in my life? What do I do?" Moving in the direction of love feels good. Yes, like our true nature is so full of joy. Our true nature is joy and love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So you only need to move then in the direction of joy. You know, I'm just thinking, but you should know this. So the whole example with the tree, if you think about it, it's like making neuron connections, right? So the moment you do the action, you are somehow energetically connected to that event, to that situation. And because it's about love, because it's even though it seems so simple, it just stays with you. You're always connected. You made that new neuron path, so to speak, in your life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that would actually be the proof that how profound that is because if you think about it from the opposite way, that if it's a negative thing, it also stays with you, but it doesn't have that well of an effect. It doesn't. You drag the heaviness of that energy with you as well.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Wow, I never thought about it this way, but I just realized this, just that little experience is a neural pathway in the positive that you have made.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I like that because when we love each other and when we have loving relationships, we do create energetic bridges. Yes, and that energetic bridge is very powerful and survivable. You know, like we tend to think when people die or animals die or we lose whatever that we love, that it's gone, but it's not gone. The love that connected us does still connect us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There is no distance. There is no... the physical is just a virtual experience, but the consciousnesses of those who are having this experience, which and those consciousnesses are already connected, they're already part of the one ocean anyway. So when they can make a connection of love, that survives, it endures. It is precious, in fact, powerful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So yeah, I like that. I really like that. So if we do this consciously, I know it's so simple, but it's so profound because if we do this, say every day, and you make all these energetic bridges with the positive, this is how you achieve the knowledge of oneness.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, oneness is already there. Well, yeah, but I'm not disagreeing. We're born in a veil, right? And so for us, we always need proof of everything. And because we encounter all these heavinesses in our lives, you know, we tend to think, "Yeah, whatever," right? But this is where you've physically, whoa, and within, get the proof. Oh my God, oneness is real.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, we know it's already there because we're told, and in your case, you actually have felt it properly, but you know, this is exactly how we have to pray for ourselves, how we can strengthen it, how we can have faith in the fact that it is true.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so the distance away from that is the not real thing. It's the non-native thing. So when we act in love and when we align ourselves with love, with joy, with service and creativity, and when we really do that, we immediately take a vibrational step back towards the enduring truth of what we already really are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The heaviness is not a fundamental thing. The dark, that you could say, the darkness is not real ultimately. It is only a temporary experience because of the distance we've come, and then vibrationally, we buy into these negative perceptions that are not in alignment with the truth. So when we let go of that which is not in alignment with the truth and we align with that which is an act in love and joy and embrace peace and enjoy a sunset or pet a dog, you know, yes, then there is an immediate vibrational return because we never lost it. It's just that now we're no longer tied up in the painful associations with the illusion.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Exactly. Oh wow, this is so profound. It hits me. Obviously, I knew it kind of, but it now just hits me how profound it is, and I'm really grateful for that. So can we go back for a second to your... you mentioned there was a life that you... well, that you decided to come here, and that was the moment that you felt that happiness, and you said, "Yeah, not gonna do that."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so the lifetime immediately preceding this one, it would that was a very appropriate lifetime for my intention. My intention was and is to integrate a very specific low vibration, which I can call a fear. This fear, to integrate a fear, a very challenging fear that in the past overcame me, and there was one life experience I had where this fear, my ego got out of control because ego is a response to fear, and I was a not very helpful person.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So now I'm integrating the same very low vibration because there's an incredible opportunity for expansion in that. So in this, anyway, so in his previous life, the life was super appropriate, and I remember accepting the veil.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so the veil is just a term. This is super hard to describe, but it's like imagine the body of your awareness, the same awareness that you are right now, like you, you know, you, not someone else, you, yeah, so connected and so breathtakingly vast and high vibration and full of joy that you're connected to all knowledge, and you're just and the bliss of being and love is just endless within you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And going from that place down, down, down, down, down, down, down in vibration, lower, lower, lower, lower, more lower, now you think you're at the bottom, lower, lower, such a low vibration that it's like ridiculous. Just, I mean, I joke about it, but that is how it felt like, "Oh God, that's why I got down into I was in the womb."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I said, "I'm not doing this. This is not happening. This is so dark. I am not going to tolerate this for a lifetime." Because when you arrive there, that's also when you take on that level of 3D, so to speak. Yeah, I was in this vibrational level of wherever that life was, right? And I responded in fear like right away. I was like, "I don't like this. I'm not doing this."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I summoned my might, and I smote the veil. I fought my way back out, and that ended that life experience. I inadvertently killed the fetus, and I had a life review for my short, super short life. Okay, so then this, then they brought me this life, and this one was not as perfectly appropriate as the other one would have been, but it was pretty good.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I reviewed this life in great detail, and I accepted this life, and then I same thing, I accepted the veil, and I plummeted down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down. I can't stress this enough how low this vibration is by comparison. Like, I mean, I kind of laugh about it because it is because when we know our true nature, we know that it's actually a sign of how incredibly creatively powerful we are, okay, that we've come this far.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that works, seeing what we can do with it here, even here, even in a world of such limitation, even with bodies of such limitation, even in a world where we can't even communicate very well with each other. I mean, we got to throw words around. We, like, the telepathic communication is gone. So there's all sorts of inability to communicate with each other.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Anyway, and fear is just running rampant in many people's lives because the constraints are so extreme. It's just that we have not evolved enough yet to fully integrate everything here, and so many of us are making fear-based choices every day rather than love-based choices. So it's a big mess.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, so there was a big mess. So it's like a catch-21, isn't it? I catch-21. I mean, I'm familiar with catch-22. It's catch-21. 22. Sorry, maybe it had like a better meaning. No, same crap. But so you did accept it this time though.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, I didn't fight it this time. Okay, but when I arrived, I immediately responded in fear again. And this time, I had this most holy moment in my whole physical journey where I was about to fight my way out again, and the... this is just so beyond language, and I feel like even just putting words on it is like blasphemy because words are just like they're it just doing it such a disservice to use words.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But the great spirit of God, the great source of all, came to me and expanded me back out, showed me everything that I still am, showed me the whole universe. I felt the whole universe in me. I felt our sun, the sun of Earth, churning in me, and it was churning with burning bliss. Wow.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." Wow. And that is the most potent, soul-shattering moment for me. But it was so relieving and calming because I thought that I had lost everything that I was. The veil felt like everything that I am was erased, and I did not like that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But yeah, after being shown this, I'm like, "Oh, I'm still that." So I let go into the simple existence of being in the womb. You know, I just let go, and I was just there, and it was fine. So as long as I didn't fight it, it was okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So the reason I share this now is because that is not specific to me. You, you're my sister. You are whoever's listening today. You are my brothers and sisters. We are all a spiritual family, and we have all come a very long way, a very long way vibrationally, not physically. We've come a very long way in our history, in our long human physical lives, to this moment.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it is amazing. This is an amazing adventure, an amazing journey. And so I just want to remind whoever is listening, you don't need to be afraid. What we really are cannot truly be harmed. We only sign up for the virtual reality experience where we can experience harm or all the multitude of everything that we experience on Earth.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But who we truly are is so perfect and unblemishable and unharmable and free that there is nothing ever to fear. And there is no more important message, I think, than that. And the other main important message is to tell you, you are unconditionally loved. Like, unconditionally, not just this nice general love that exists for everybody, but you, I mean, that's true too, but you specifically are just so deeply celebrated and cherished, and you're so precious.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We've all forgotten that. You know, we're walking around here on Earth, and we're hurting, and everyone's looking for the love that seems to have been lost, and we seek it in everything. We seek it in objects and activities, in people, and in drugs, and in the next job, and the next thing we can do, and the next TV show, and but we never really find the full satisfaction.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Exactly, because it's not in the physical. But then what would you say to people, how to remind themselves of it because you had that brave moment where you were shown that profound love, which others obviously don't because I couldn't remember the first seven years because I got out every single time, but then when I finally accepted at after seven years old to be here, it was like one big homesick feeling.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes. Oh my gosh, yes. It took to way in my 40s to finally accept I'm here, and I've got accepted, and that's how long it took. I feel that your answer, your own answer, is very powerful. The okay, and that is acceptance. Okay, because fear, when we're afraid, the ego rises up. That's just the part of us that wants to fix the problem. Now there's a big problem. Now is the big problem. I got to fix it. Yeah, how do I fix it? Well, what can I believe that will make me feel better? What can I own that will make me feel better? What can I do that will, you know, all the games.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There is profound power in actually letting go of everything and fully accepting and feeling everything. Well, even being low vibration, even being bodily, even being in pain, even being whatever. I'm sorry, go ahead.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, I was going to say, the problem lies in judging the feeling and becoming the feeling, while the feeling is merely a biological event, which and that's the difficult part. There's two levels: there's a vibrational event, and there's the biological event.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, all right, so then can you speak on that because it's so hard not to judge it because you know it hurts. Well, no, but it's okay. So I have experiences of extreme neurochemical pain at times, and I used to be very afraid of it, and now I recognize that pain itself, no matter the type of pain, but including the potentially extremely painful neurochemical imbalance pain that can happen, is just a sensation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The thing is though, what we do then is we take the sensation, and we are real quick to throw a story on it, and usually the story is pretty fear-based, and then we really suffer. You know, it's the story that makes us suffer. It's the resistance and the story that hurts. Now, the pain hurts, but the pain is just a sensation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so I find that it's actually very powerful if you drop all the stories, every label, every preconception, every reason why this is a bad thing, and just feel, just know it, just know it all the way. Just bringing the... this is a term I like from Eckhart Tolle, bringing the light of your awareness, or maybe that's Rupert Spira, maybe they both use the term, but I really love this term, the light of your awareness, into that feeling.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that just means you allow yourself to feel it and be aware of it. You fully allow it. I mean, I came to experience an extreme trauma in my 20s, and I knew even before I came that this body had biological limitations that would make my journey very difficult, and so I experienced that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But the thing is, that is an incredible opportunity. And so when it arrives, when whatever arrives, whatever arrives, I at least in my own walk, I seek to fully feel and allow all of it without the resistance, without the story. When you were talking about being very homesick, and you know, I feel very much like I relate to when you say there's like a resistance to even being physical.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, I get that. I remember a few years ago, I was standing like as I was going through my awakening journey, maybe I don't know, maybe eight or nine years ago, I was standing at the toilet peeing, and I remember while I was peeing, I remember noticing I was afraid of the sensation of urinating. Okay, because I didn't have control over it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was simple. I'm just using it as an example of I recognize, "Oh, I am not okay even with that at the time." So now I realize this is a very deep fear. I seek now to fully be bodily, fully to fully accept this vibration, to surrender to it, not fight it, but allow it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh my God, and there is so much power there because if you can do that here, oh my God, you just hit the nail on the head. It's like I was just thinking about the pain, and it doesn't matter what kind of pain, whether it's physical, mental, it doesn't matter. So we hang a value onto that, which means we judge it, and then usually because it's so uncomfortable, it becomes fear because who wants to be uncomfortable, right?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so you become fearful of the feeling of uncomfortableness, which then gives a whole different load to it again, which then amplifies the whole thing instead of going the opposite direction and saying, "Okay, this is what it is. I can't do anything about it. I have to let go." And so it is what it is.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I have to say, I've experienced that this year. You know, I told you about my cat's dying. People know when they die. At a certain point, there was a point that he said, "Oh, it hurts like hell. It hurts, but can I do anything about it? Not really, so I may as well accept what is." Even though the pain is still there, and I have to say that made it like 75 percent less heavy.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Obviously, I fell for the trap again in the past two weeks because it was really heavy, but God, you just remind me again right now how it is done because it's so quickly how we can forget it again to just not judge it because that makes it happen, and not judge ourselves, and not judge ourselves for not being at peace.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Healing Through Awareness**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Healing_Through_Awareness**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Healing Through Awareness</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian explains the power of mindfulness and self-compassion in healing.

He highlights meditation, conscious choice, and changing focus as tools for breaking cycles of fear and suffering.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, you know, so many of us are just so hard on ourselves. Oh yeah, we're doing a pretty darn ambitious creative thing here. I mean, our guides, when they look, I mean, those on the other side, when they look on us, they have a lot of respect and a tremendous amount of respect, and they see the constraints that we're operating within.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So we need to just acknowledge, "Oh wow, I've got some serious constraints here," and it's okay to acknowledge, "Wow, I've just spent 40 years being afraid of something." That's okay. Now, choose something else. Like, you always have the power now, even if there is a lot of past momentum. The universe will respond. Your intent in the present moment always has power.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, it can't be any other way. So there's never actually a circumstance that is, put this way, there's never a circumstance that is bigger than you, like too big for you. And I say this knowing that because I had post-traumatic stress for a number of years in my 20s after this traumatic event, and it was only after processing and healing that through therapy and a lot of internal work that I did EMDR, I did too, that I had this awakening journey.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, I had to really meet all that deep dark stuff and process that stuff. So I'm not making light of it when I say your consciousness is deeper than your deepest crap. Hang on, say that again. Your consciousness is deeper than your deepest crap, your deepest pain that you resist, your deepest fear that you resist, your deepest whatever it is that is totally unacceptable.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You're actually deeper than that. It's just that we get over one, it looks too big to handle, so we put it away. We put it under the rug. We lock it away. We put filled 600 layers of ego on top of it. You know, most of us have some layers of fear that are pretty darn extreme. That's okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I'm just encouraging that when you're ready, you don't have to be afraid. You can actually go face your own crap. I'm just thinking about our responsibility because we tend not to take that because you know, feelings, I have feelings, can't help it. But we can actually, and so there's this quote that I posted the other day, and it says, "What you're not changing, you're choosing."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when we get the knowledge of these things, we know that we're choosing. It doesn't matter if we forget about it a little bit, but eventually, this is the whole process, isn't it? Because it's hard work evolving. It's really hard work. Right, it's especially hard when you come to a place like this that's this extreme.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, like this is like, I think it was Peter Panagar maybe who said it, but I forget who said it, but one of the near-death experiences I love and respect said, "Being human is like an extreme sport." It is. It is. Okay, so here we are like on Mount Everest, and we're like, "Oh my gosh, it's so cold. There's like no air up here. I'm exhausted."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, you're climbing Mount Everest. Like, it's cold. And then you have to learn to cope while you're planted there. Right, exactly. That's what it is. Well, here we are. Yeah, we learned to cope here. We are, we learned to cope.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and as we do that, it's not like just a big hardship. The whole thing is not just a big hardship. As we cope and integrate, yeah, the native joy that we are can explode outward because the native we are natively joy and love. So when we integrate the experience now, there's this growth.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, if this is just a dualistic metaphor, and we transcend duality, so don't talk, but like, if you start here at source, you know, you come all the way out here, and now you're like climbing like Mount Everest. Now you're like way out here. So now this is really hard, but if you can integrate this experience, then you energetically and your consciousness expands to here, and there's this profound growth in power and joy and love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So many of us choose to do the really hard climbs. You know, yeah, none of us want to take many of us are like, "Everest, I want to go to Everest. I want to go back there. You know, I want to try to get to the summit this time." You know, and so often it's the guys who are like, you know, that's a pretty hard climb. It's pretty cold.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, some people are like, "I want to try it without gloves." You know, I'm just using a silly metaphor. I'm just saying that we know that the contrast is a potential. It is a valuable potential that is given to us that we can utilize. And so choosing how to meet those circumstances is utilizing the counter pressure of life and the way that it's meant to be.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, the counter pressure, like the circumstances of your life, are the counter pressure. It's like if you're laying on a weight bench and you're pushing up weights, you know, do you push up weights because that's just the way life is? No, you just use the counter pressure while you're there. You push it up, and then you put it down, and you don't have to lift weights ever again if you don't want.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, we don't have to incarnate if we don't want, but the counter pressure of your circumstance is a huge opportunity. So you might as well lift the weights while you're here. We forget that we had a choice up front, right? That's where the catch-22 comes in because you come here, and then your veil, and you forget that you actually chose it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, which is like, it's like the soul takes a small portion of itself, a subset, and allocates it into the human character, and the human character thinks it's all that the self is, but it's not all that the self is. You yourself are much more than the human character. That's just a part of you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So then, you know, when you choose to come here, do you get to choose any life? Do you get... I mean, I know that you get options, but or do you just get one life that you get to choose? I guess not, but well, I can only share what I know from my own experience because I think it's different for different people.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But in my case, I had an intention, and they brought me a life package that met the intention that was a good match. They, the guides, reviewed the database, so to speak, and said, "This life will work. What do you think about this?" And then I reviewed it in incredible detail, like millions and millions and millions of possibilities of what might unfold, what was likely, what was unlikely, what it would feel like to be this person, to come this far out in the wilderness because I knew that I was going to be going super far out in one direction.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, my life path in this life is not a general life. I'm doing one very specific thing to a very extreme degree. That's what I'm doing. Do you see also the amnesia that you are there with since you get to see it, you also know that you're gonna be suffering? Well, you know that there's a potential to suffer.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's never a requirement to suffer. No, I get that, but obviously, when you're up there, you don't know that you're gonna how it's gonna feel to be completely without the memory. Yes, it's okay. So in my experience, I reviewed what it would be like to be me ahead of time, and I was extremely excited at the opportunity, even though I knew it would probably crush me and traumatize me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh wow, I was extremely excited at the opportunity. Now, the ego doesn't like that. You know, yeah. But the okay, so the soul knows our true nature. It just knows what we actually are, and there it knows there's nothing to fear. And we do know we will be veiled. You know, we do know that we're not going to remember. That's just the name of the game.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But we've also done it well. Not I don't know everybody, but most of us, I believe, probably all of us, have done it many times. Yeah, and so it's not like a new thing. Like, veils are used. The veil is a like you think of like a technology that is additive. It allows an expansion of being through these types of extreme experiences that are only possible through veiling.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And we know that ahead of time. Okay, yeah, so then what like the current situation, you know, we're busy in chaos in the world, and people are literally scrambling to get on top of their strugglings and evolving. You can literally see it right. Everybody is trying to fight their way into that learning process. I think it's more than I've ever seen before.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So what would you say that would help at the moment to give people help, advice, how to cope? Yeah, first, I wouldn't really differentiate a given circumstance too much because I'm just making this comment because you know, a lot of people have asked questions about COVID or political situations or whatever, as if, "Wow, this is true chaos now. Now we've really reached it."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The thing is, Earth, okay, so there's all sorts of context happening on Earth, and we tend to have our fears provoked one way or another. Like, yeah, no matter what the prop that's stimulating the fear, yeah, it's the fear. It's us that's real. It's not really the props that are real.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so I'm just making that distinction because it's not like we're in some terrible period right now. It's just this is the nature of Earth, and Earth is going through an awakening process. So there is a lot of friction on the surface right now because there are a lot of old ideas and thought patterns that are asking to be challenged in our collective consciousness, and the collective is going through a shift, and that's good.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But meanwhile, yeah, so what can we do? Okay, well, I mean, of course, each person's walk is so unique and individual, but one thing that I think is worth mentioning is that there is nothing to fear and that we can accept our experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't even necessarily just want to say accept the circumstance. It is accepting circumstance, but really what I'm talking about is what is your story? What is it like in your own mind, in your own life, your own personal story, and where does it hurt? Try to accept there and seek in yourself where your intent is aligned with fear rather than love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The context stuff is going to be different for everybody. It's always going to change, but how the quality with which you make choices in it is what is powerful and important, and you always have that power. Don't forget that you have power. You know, we tend to give away our power because we think, "Oh, all this that might these people have my power, and this money has my power, and this wreath, everything external has the power, and I don't have any power."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, you are a powerful creative being. You are a part of source. You are like a piece of God, a fragment of the whole, a drop in the ocean. You have a ton of power. So what stories are you losing yourself in? See if you can locate it and let go of the stories and allow and fully experience and feel everything that is within you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I find meditation to be very powerful and helpful for this because over the long haul, over the long term, as we meditate, we gain familiarity with what we really are, which is awareness itself, being, being, yeah, exactly. And that which we are not our thoughts tends to fall away.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, and then as that happens, we already are of peace and joy already right now. Conscious that is the nature of consciousness. So as we let go of, we release our death grip on the painful stories, and as we do that, the nature of life rises back up. The nature of life is peace and love and joy, and that is never far away from you, no matter what is going on in the world, no matter what's going on in your life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That peace and joy of your spirit, that's what you already are right now. It's just that you've lost yourself in the story of the fear and the ego, and that hurts. Oh gosh, yeah, I'm just pointing out because it's not a far step. It's not like you need to go do a hundred things. You just have the power now to go take a step in this direction towards your true self, towards the consciousness that you are beneath the story, beneath thought.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Actually, I experienced it this week. I was so frustrated. I was in so much pain. I felt grief and all that, and I couldn't take it anymore because you know, you're fighting it, and all of a sudden, I came to that point that I said, "Okay, stop it, and just be." And so I just felt it, but I didn't judge it, and all of a sudden, things expanded around me because I didn't judge it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It also took away so much noise around it that I was just being me with that frustration, whatever I felt, but that was it. And I thought, "Okay, so then all I have to do is just sit through it." But in the meantime, it's like because I would say, I want to say in the meantime, I could look around again, but literally, it's rather that I could feel again around me because now, yes, I was feeling horrible and all that, but because I didn't judge it, I now had the room to...  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We cannot call it seeing, is it? Because it's not about the seeing, but rather experiencing that, "Oh, there's me just sitting here on the couch with this awful feeling, but that's not all there is. There is so much more." And so I like what you said about that's not all that there is. There's so much more because when we are thinking a thought or when we're lost in a story, we become unconscious.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, we move in the direction of not being alert. We are asleep in the thought. Thinking is like having a little dream. Like, right now, I'm having this little dream that I'm hungry, and I want a sandwich. And that means, "Oh my God, that moment that you're hungry and you want a sandwich, that's you are the being who is hungry and wants a sandwich. You're not the whole. You're the being who wants a sandwich."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So when we let go, it is a move towards alertness. Like meditation, some people like, okay, so in my book, I provide a meditation exercise that really has worked well for me, and it begins with an exercise in thinking and thought to regain one's focus, but ultimately, it's not about a thought.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Meditation is a move towards complete alertness, like awakening, like the most awake, alert, just go see exactly the most alert way, eyes wide open way that you can. What is the present moment? Yeah, now you'll fall asleep back into a thought. "Am I meditating? Is the time up? Did someone just knock on my front door?" That's okay. Go back to knowing the spacious awareness that you are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There's so much peace and power there. So I like that you said that because really, that's a really good example of how you know we get stuck sometimes. We'll be stuck in the asleepness for a long time. You know, you said it's so brilliant because never ever did I connect that these thoughts, like every single time you judge your feelings and you're busy fighting yourself, you're unconscious.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, it's literally every time you're not being. When you wake up and you're like, "Oh my gosh, I was unconscious. Now I feel bad about myself because I was unconscious." No, you don't have to do that. Yeah, okay, you were unconscious. You didn't know. The vicious circle, isn't it? You go, ego is unconscious.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh my God, you know how that's Eckhart Tolle's one of his main messages actually. I really love that about his. Oh yeah, me too. Hugo is unconscious. I never thought about it that way though, although I'm a big fan of Eckhart Tolle. I watched a lot of his lectures, especially the one on the ego was the best ever.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But you know, if he, it's so simple. If we keep that in mind every time we judge and think, yeah, we are unconscious. And yeah, and then so then what happens is we think the next thought is, "Well, then how do I get out of that?" And then we just think about it. We spin our way by being.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, by being fully. You see, if you can see if you so if that happens, you know, if you're like, "Oh, I don't even know how to start that process," after this, go sit in a room by yourself for five minutes and do nothing. Yeah, if you feel uncomfortable, if you feel uncomfortable, that is that's okay. That's the need of the ego, that's the craving of the stimulation of thought. That's okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Just go sit by yourself for five minutes. Yeah, and then after that, you can do whatever you like. I'm saying that because it's like you got to take the time. You have to. We're right now we're in linear time, so we need to take time to actually go do this and just be. But this is nothing you need to do for five minutes exactly, but that's true meditation. You don't have to sit for it. You can literally do it any moment of the day.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, definitely. Wow, you know what? I knew all that, but I never realized I forgot about it. How quickly you can forget about it. Right, yes. Yeah, I'm not gonna judge it, but this is actually what we need to be aware of. Yeah, I mean, now I know it, but next week I can't forget it, but the whole point is that you are aware of it now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And you know, and that's how you train yourself because that's the hard work where it is. Right, I have a little sticky note above my desk that says, "It is an illusion," and I wrote it when I had just had a non-physical experience where I was not local. I knew that the physical was arising within me. It's not that I was stuck in some body or something, and I really knew it, and I wrote this note for myself.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And there's probably been like 200 times or something I've looked up at that note and went, "Oh yeah, it's an illusion. I forgot," because I keep getting sucked back in too. You know, like I get associated with the human story too. I had that text from Edgar Thomas's book that I had on a sticky note. It says, "You are the captain of your own vessel," and it's not the other way around.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And yes, exactly, it's not right, the other way around, but that's what we literally do 90% of the time is that we let ourselves be driven by our ego. Well, essentially, we are the pilot of our own story, of our own vessel. And so yeah, that's that's, I don't know exactly how he actually wrote it exactly, but I still have it on a sticky note, which you know, I need to get out of there again because you know, it's so profound.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's so necessary, especially in these days. Right, I see people struggle a lot, that includes myself, but God, this conversation just got me back to where I needed to be. That's wonderful. Yeah, it's helped me also for sure. Right, and so did you have something to add about you were talking about the consciousness of people or was that about this for which topic?  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Nature of Consciousness and Oneness**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Nature_of_Consciousness_and_Oneness**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Nature of Consciousness and Oneness</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian concludes by discussing how consciousness itself is the bridge between physical and spiritual realities, reinforcing that we are already part of the greater whole." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_concludes_by_discussing_how_consciousness_itself_is_the_bridge_between_physical_and_spiritual_realities,_reinforcing_that_we_are_already_part_of_the_greater_whole."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian concludes by discussing how consciousness itself is the bridge between physical and spiritual realities, reinforcing that we are already part of the greater whole.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You said that you wanted to discuss how we are all one and how the topic that I mentioned before we went live. Yeah, yeah, so yeah, this is probably a good topic to close on. So I think it's important to point out that the consciousness, okay, we tend to think of the afterlife and the spiritual as something far away.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, it's around some corner somewhere. I can't see it. I hope it's real. You know, I don't see it. What's going on? Okay, I recognize that when we're deeply associated with form and with duality, that that is a nap. Like, we tend to feel that the spiritual may be far away. There couldn't be anything closer to you because your consciousness itself is the playing field of spirit.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is the spirit, and your consciousness itself is the very thing that is knowing this moment, this conversation, this sound. It's not far. It's closer to you than your own breath. Yes, I just, it's what you are. So I, and then okay, so the reason that I mention that is because this experience of the physical is occurring in and on that consciousness.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You already, you're already there. Your consciousness is already on the other side because you are a part. If you think of your consciousness as the water of the ocean, it's water. Yeah, you're already a part of the whole. I just realized after everything we just discussed that I now understand the concept because it's just our consciousness, our higher self, which we can really easily reach when we are conscious, is that we are already there.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's what we're always connected to. Oh my God, never ever did I think I would understand the concept of you know, because indeed when you die, transition, I would say, it seems so far away, but we're already there, and I never understood it. I hope others do too by the way because they are so profound.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, when your body dies, the same awareness that you have is the same. It's just now the constraints go away, and now all of a sudden, it's the same exact... the very in fact, the guide Seth says he has a quote something to the effect of, "Many of you die, and you don't even realize you've died."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, because the transition is so seamless. However, birth is a very shocking, I mean, you know, incarnation is a very shocking process, and that's what I've described. That's the difficult step. The other step is wonderful. Isn't it that maybe people are just afraid of the process of dying because it's always associated with pain and suffering?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Right, because I never thought of thinking beyond that because literally that so-called suffering or pain is like probably going to the dentist. You know, and you know, you have a bit of a pain or a lot, or you're scared of it because you know, you never know what they're gonna hit, and if you are anesthetized enough, whatever, right?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that's it, but after you go away from the dentist, it's all over, and everything is good. So what we really focus on with death is that moment. It's the moment that we have to transition, and I guess that we need to shift the focus to what it's really about then.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I feel, and so I have a fear of death. Sure, I'm not not death. I have a fear of the process of having my body go through a dying process. I yearn for the transition. That's not the same, but I'm just saying that I feel that that is a very similar fear to the fear that I've been processing in my life in general overall and through the trauma in my 20s.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so what is the what do we focus on then? Just the present moment, even if you're dying. Yeah, when you're not dying, your body is just going through a change. You'll be fine. What is the present moment? It's like, how about this? Like, let's say before you go to bed at night, you know, you lay down.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You're not stressed about going to sleep. Sleep's great. Well, I mean, I actually used to be stressed about going to sleep when I was young because I didn't... this is in my teenage years. I remember feeling afraid of letting go of control enough to even fall asleep, which to me sounds so strange now because you know, that's a seems like a different lifetime almost.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But anyway, for most people, when we lay down to go to sleep, we're not afraid. Our consciousness experiences prior to sleep, and then maybe we experience dreams, and then maybe we experience that the next morning is there, but do we ever have a break in awareness?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, no. Now, there are differences in alertness, biological alertness. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about your awareness itself. Right, have you ever known anything ever that wasn't your own awareness of it? Well, we think we don't. Well, I'm saying we've never... there's not a single person that has ever known anything that wasn't their own awareness of it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm pointing out that awareness is always present. So just like before you go to sleep, you're not afraid of going to sleep. You're just in the moment, and then you're in the next moment, whether it be dreaming or whether you wake up in the morning. Now you're in the next moment. Now you go make your coffee. It's just it's fine.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Death is similar, except now there's a huge relinquishing of constraints. It's like taking off this very, very, very dense suit. Yeah, and you're still you, but now you're like not in a suit. Now it's like... well, I don't think that is actually what anybody is afraid of. What we're really afraid of is the unexpected way of what is going to happen.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So we always look in the future instead of being in the now. Right, so I mean, if somebody falls asleep and dies in their sleep, oh, everybody's like, "Oh, there's a great death," right? But if it's an agonizing long stretch till you get to the point where you die because then you know, you want to die as fast as possible if anything, and then without feeling it, right?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So we're always afraid of the moment before the death, not really the death itself. Right, which is the only thing. Some people may be afraid of the death itself. Yeah, I'm just mentioning that because I think some people may think that there's an oblivion or a destruction. Oh, right, yeah. I'm just mentioning that because that's an idea. You can only have the idea of oblivion.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, but again, even that is taking expectations. It is attaching yourself to an expectation because that's where everything goes south, right? When we expect things, and you know, and that's where the fear comes in. And so, you know, and that comes often also with religions and stuff because you know, "Oh, there are all these promises," but at the end of the day, you know, somebody asked, "What about losing his spouse?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I have that dilemma now. You mean like in death more or relationship? Because I'm trying to understand what you mean there in the chat. But I think anything that we are expecting is is the expectation based on fear, which usually it is, right? And so, and that makes it suffering instead of being in the now and just let happen whatever needs to happen.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We don't know that because it's in the future, so whatever happens now, you have control over, which is not easy in this plane of existence. You know, since even after enlightenment, you still have to do your laundry. So you know, you still have to plan ahead of things, and that's where it makes it so complicated is that we are constantly confronted with planning and things, so we automatically plan also what we have no control over.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Coping with Loss and Mourning**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Coping_with_Loss_and_Mourning**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Coping with Loss and Mourning</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian addresses grief, emphasizing that love never dies and that our connection with loved ones remains intact beyond physical existence." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_addresses_grief,_emphasizing_that_love_never_dies_and_that_our_connection_with_loved_ones_remains_intact_beyond_physical_existence."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian addresses grief, emphasizing that love never dies and that our connection with loved ones remains intact beyond physical existence.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I only have a few minutes left, but I wanted to ask, did the questioner... what was the question? I just want to see if there's anything I could do. Yeah, "What about losing a spouse? I have that dilemma now." Is there a dilemma that this person's spouse is in the process of passing?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I think it has to do with the separation from another person in general. I guess I think it doesn't really matter whether it's true death or... okay, but it doesn't say. Okay, well, the thing is, we think that the physical is what is most real. So when we see something, when a person's physical presence is now absent from us, whether it be by breakup or death, we feel a profound loss because now we're not able to interact in the way that we know with that person.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But what is real has not been lost and cannot be lost. The loving connection between each spirit remains, and the spirits remain. The spirit is what's real. That person's spirit remains. Your spirit remains. That which is real remains. It can't be lost. The forms can change. The play can change.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then when it changes, it's okay to experience deeply the emotions that arise. You know, I'm not at all saying we should not pay heed to the mourning. It's just that the true substance has not been lost. The only thing that is lost is the temporary physical expression.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I like... I'll just, this is uh, this may sound unrelated, but it's just kind of real. I think maybe it's kind of a similar idea. So where is the five-year-old me? Well, you know, that body's gone now. Every cell in it's probably been replaced by now. You know, there are so those cells are all dead and gone.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Where is the fiber? What happened? Well, I'm still here. I'm still me. The I that knows this experience of having a 41-year-old body is the same I that knew a five-year-old. My associations have changed. My story has changed. I've changed. I've grown, but I, but the body, like I don't really miss it even because what I am is here now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I am consciousness. I'm just pointing that out because you know, there's always a process of change and death happening, but we are always present anyway. And the person that we love is always present anyway, even if their body is gone. They can be with us right now. It doesn't... they can... we can have a tangible relationship with them in a way that what we would consider to be non-physical, but is still a very real, tangible relationship.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's possible. Yeah, yeah, we attach to the parts that you know, we consider as lost. Yeah, you know, but so then how would you deal with that because like now I miss my cats. I want to touch them. I want, but I can't. I don't have control over that. They're gone, period. So it's about accepting, right?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it's about accepting and fully feeling. Yeah, and discovering how you are meeting the moment. It's okay to feel what you feel. Yeah, and it's okay to meet it with openness and to meet yourself with compassion and you know, it's not about rejecting. This is not about setting up a new boundary.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When we make statements like this, it's not about saying, "Okay, now don't mourn because you didn't really lose anything. Don't worry about that." Yeah, I'm not even saying that. I'm what I mean is that which is truly real, enduring, cannot die. Yeah, but as the forms shift and change, and we feel emotion, it's very good to feel our emotion and to really acknowledge what we feel and what we know.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, if you feel something, you feel it. Like, it's a part of your experience, so it's worth honoring it and knowing it, and then seeing what you do with it. You know, what choice will you make from it, with it, to it? You know, well, Barcelonette is saying, "Never underestimate the power of a woman. My whole life, they had let my life's journey in such a positive way, missing my wife every day."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So yeah, and you know, it really does... whatever I guess we because you know, I have that with my cats, and I guess something that somebody told me is, you know, look back at it with love, with the memory of it, and cherish that the memories and look back at it with love, and really, that's all we can do.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The deep mourning is a sign and reflection of the deep love. The mourning is because we love, and the love can't die. The connection came well. I never thought the mourning is just like it shows us that we love, but that which we truly love can't die.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, I know that it can seem just cruel in such a cruel way persistent here in the physical, and now this person that we loved is physically gone, and it's like, I'm not judging us when I say that our egos rage in response and go, "What? This is horrible and terrifying, and I don't accept this."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But you have a choice. Yeah, how to meet even that pain, even that mourning, and that love does not die. That connection remains. The relationship is still there, and after the physical is passed, you will still have that relationship. Like, you can't lose it. The things that you love, you get to keep.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Let's see that way. Like, the physical will pass. You don't keep your shirt. You don't keep your money. You don't keep your body or your hair. That stuff's all form, but what you keep is your love, your very nature.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But we attach to the physical of it, right? And that's where the hurt comes in. But yeah, I mean, I guess, but even the physical of it can be experienced again if you like. It's just... I'm just saying that did you say how?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, yeah, well, because we are thought, okay, so we're creative beings, and in thought-responsive reality systems, we can create all sorts of environments if we want. We can... well, you can't bring that person back. No, but I'm saying you can in a astral environment, whatever word you want to use, go to a non-physical environment with that being.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The two of you can have a picnic again if you'd like. That's no problem. Well, you need to know how to do that though. Well, I just mean I don't mean necessarily right now. Yeah, right now you are dealing with the physical character. You actually can do it now technically. It's just we get deeply associated with the human story, so it's difficult to access those higher portions of ourselves.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is possible to have an out-of-body experience and to interact in a very, very, very real, tangible, touchable way. I mean, those realities are actually even more real, more lucid, and colorful and real than even this. I'm just pointing out that even like, you know, we're saying we mourn the loss of the physical, but it's not like you can't ever even enjoy that again. You can.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's impossible. Yeah, well, you know, and on that note, I love that we had that. It was such a great, profound conversation, and it helped me a lot, and I hope a lot of other people as well. And where can people find you?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so my website is awalkinthephysical.com. I just want to point out that my book is available for free if anyone's interested. It's on my website. The book page, the third link down, is a link to the Google Books entry. I just think it's important that it's available to everybody. It's not about money. I just want to share the message.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There's some talks and other videos links there, and if anybody would like to email me, I mean, I've been ridiculously busy lately, and I'm going to be starting a new job soon, but my email is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="mailto:awalkinthephysical@gmail.com." target="_blank">awalkinthephysical@gmail.com.</a> I'll definitely try to respond when I can.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I have your link in the description where you can find your book, so I assume that's also your page, right? You know, there's a book page on the main page. Yeah, okay. And I also gonna share the video. I do recommend you guys to watch it, and that's an interview where he tells the whole story from his experience on the previous life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I put it in the chat. I also put it in the description so people can check it out. Definitely recommend it. And thank you so much for being here, and I really hope that I can invite you again because we had such a great conversation, and I think it helped me too for sure.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I just love connecting in this way because I too get sucked into the daily stresses of life, and it's easy to forget who we really are while we're here. You know, and so if we can encourage each other, it's just a wonderful thing. I mean, we're all kind of like walking each other home. I've heard it said before, and I really like that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, and so I really just love that we can have opportunities to just connect in a way that is genuine and about these larger topics that they may seem abstract, but they're not. We're talking about very real things here. Oh gosh, you have no idea how this helps me. Very meaningful. This is very meaningful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is so... I will invite you again, and in the next year, I hope that's okay. And I hope everybody enjoyed this conversation, and yeah, check out his interview, check out his book, and also remember, I'm on Isetti with James Gilliland on Saturday, and I will be back on Monday with Jackie Pearson, which will be fun as well.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I thank you so much, Christian, for coming, and thank you to everybody in the chat and my mods for being there, and thank you, UFO Mark, for your donation.

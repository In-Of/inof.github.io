of pre-birth existence, his assumption that others shared this knowledge, and the challenges of retaining these memories in physical life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Physical reality is like a bright point of light that you just never look away from, but you can. I've experienced that. I had some pre-birth memory as a very young child, and I assumed other people would just know that we weren't from here, but they didn't. I didn't want to forget all the way, but I knew that even having a little bit of memory would actually make this life more challenging.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember sailing through the galaxies and being in awe at their beauty and being so excited to participate, and being like, "Wow, we get to be these things!" It wasn't just humans; it was anything we wanted in the universe. In higher states, you can tangibly feel and know that you are a part of all, and the bliss of that is unspeakably amazing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was aware pre-life that this universe is like the most extreme when it comes to the experience of separation, and that is a very alien constraint. It's not about masochism or experiencing extreme limitation. We grow in extreme ways. The physical is a simulation anyway, but what's not a simulation is consciousness itself and the quality of intent that it refines, and we get to keep that.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Akashic Records and Life Reviews" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Akashic_Records_and_Life_Reviews"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Akashic Records and Life Reviews</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he explains how life reviews allow souls to analyze past choices, examine unactualized possibilities, and extract lessons from different life paths." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_explains_how_life_reviews_allow_souls_to_analyze_past_choices,_examine_unactualized_possibilities,_and_extract_lessons_from_different_life_paths."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he explains how life reviews allow souls to analyze past choices, examine unactualized possibilities, and extract lessons from different life paths.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Akashic records—we can go into that and pull out information and say, "Well, what if I would have made this choice?" Here's the thing, though—this is really important. I had some pre-birth memory as a very young child, and I assumed other people would just know that we weren't from here, but they didn't. They didn't talk about it, and then that memory left me completely by the age of like five or six.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But my body was 30 years old when I took up a long-term meditation practice, and after a few months, I started to have non-physical experiences—so very real, extremely eye-opening out-of-body experiences—and the pre-birth memory just kind of arrived at the same time. It wasn't like a big epiphany; it was actually like the more normal thing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And yeah, I mean, I'm aware, of course, that here on Earth, we're veiled, so we don't commonly remember that. That's like part of the game, but it does seem strange to me that we don't remember, you know, having seen and known that. It is a bit strange. It's like walking around on the stage of a play, perhaps, you know, and the characters don't remember they're just in a play.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Was it quite disconcerting recognizing that other people don't remember what you remember? Like, how did you arrange yourself in a situation? Life?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: No, I don't think it was disconcerting. The more disconcerting part is simply the vibrational distance between our true nature, which, you know, is hugely connected and full of love and peace and joy and freedom, you know, and when you touch that, oh, it's amazing versus the kind of the average vibration on Earth. It's comparatively very low.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Facing the Contrast Between Realms" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Facing_the_Contrast_Between_Realms"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Facing the Contrast Between Realms</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he shares personal struggles with the vibrational difference between higher states and Earth, emphasizing the emotional weight of adjusting to this world." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_shares_personal_struggles_with_the_vibrational_difference_between_higher_states_and_Earth,_emphasizing_the_emotional_weight_of_adjusting_to_this_world."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he shares personal struggles with the vibrational difference between higher states and Earth, emphasizing the emotional weight of adjusting to this world.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I think that is the more stark challenge, at least it was for me, that when I was getting in touch with that and having those experiences, Earth is like such a different vibrational place, you know, to experience day-to-day. That was the challenging part for me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, it's really interesting because, following your work, it seems like where we go from this very infinite space to a very electively chosen finite experience. Let's talk about the vibrations for a sec. Like, is Earth the densest place, or is it just what? It is high density. Like, how would you describe it relative to...  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, so this is really hard to talk about. I'll just quickly disclaim before we get into this that language just does not do any of this service. Like, I have to just say that up front because you can't really effectively use earthly language. It's just not possible. You know, language is form, symbols, and our true nature fully transcends all of the context of Earth, all the symbols. It transcends linear time and discrete location, you know, these things that we take for granted. So I just have to say that, you know, first.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Role of Vibrations in Consciousness" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Role_of_Vibrations_in_Consciousness"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Role of Vibrations in Consciousness</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he explores vibrational states, how higher consciousness feels fully connected, and how Earth’s density imposes unique challenges to awareness." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_explores_vibrational_states,_how_higher_consciousness_feels_fully_connected,_and_how_Earth’s_density_imposes_unique_challenges_to_awareness."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he explores vibrational states, how higher consciousness feels fully connected, and how Earth’s density imposes unique challenges to awareness.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so the vibration—we could simply say that our true nature is completely connected to the whole. And our... okay, so when we say vibration, what are we talking about? It's a vibration of consciousness itself, beingness itself. Okay, so in higher states, you can tangibly feel and know—not just understand but like know—that you are a part of all. You're individuated, but you're also connected to all, and the bliss of that is unspeakably amazing versus the Earth experience, which, yes, is extremely limiting, extremely constraining, extremely dense.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Not bad—it's not inherently bad—it's just extremely limiting. The constraints are very high. I was aware pre-life that this universe is like the highest degree of... in the... okay, so every universe, every reality type, has its own like build or intention, and we can at least say that ours, our universe, is like the most extreme when it comes to the experience of separation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So like, you can't get more separate than what we experience on Earth, and that is a very alien constraint. It's not standard; it's not typical for the spirit to not tangibly know its connectedness to everyone else and to all things. So adopting that sense of separation, that limitation, that obscuring of your knowing—you know, we call that the veil—that's integral to the game, and that is an extreme limitation set that, yes, is, you know, the most dense in the direction of separation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yes, it begs the question—I know this is like, "What is the purpose of life?"—but why? Why the separation? In your opinion, like, why do we come down here to experience this separated thing? Because I think also just in that, like, would love to point to because you also made a choice.

If you can speak to that, like, you were inspired, and then you made a choice, and then... yeah, again, words are very difficult here, but in short, what we're doing is participating in the expansion of love and joy—the expansion of our being through the integration of experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And what kind of experience are we integrating? A high-constraint experience. So duality itself—this whole system of ups and downs, left and right, hot and cold, birth and death, you know, linear time—that whole system is subsequent. It's not primary, but it exists to create something. Like, this is just a metaphor, but like a cave carves out a cave into which beingness can then fill and know.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So through experiencing extreme limitation, we grow in extreme ways. When we integrate that experience—it's not automatic, actually, but it does happen—because we, as consciousness, are like experience integrators. So we come to have the experience of being human and to actually experience that perspective and then come to terms with it, integrate it, really, really process it, and to see if we can wield an intention that is in alignment with our true nature through our choice-making.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That means an intention that is love-based—love, freedom, joy, and peace—an intention that's in alignment with that rather than the intention of fear, which means the ego and all the shenanigans that arise out of ego. If we can choose that even in these constraints, oh my gosh, then that true nature is deeply refined—is the only verb I can think of—and that is an incredible opportunity, even though the constraints are so high.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I am very, very passionate about lifting up the human experience as such an opportunity. Like, and I know it sounds crazy, you know, because like, I signed up, and I experienced a very challenging personal trauma in my 20s. I've had chronic illness on and off my whole life. I've gone through a lot of trauma, but the thing is, oh my gosh, the opportunity to meet that, to process it, to heal it, to really get into the nitty-gritty, you know, and oh my gosh, it's like winning the lottery.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, being given a human life is like winning the lottery. I mean, I felt like I had been given a winning lottery ticket worth a million dollars. That's how it felt to be given the chance to play a human.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: What do you think it was?

You know, people tend to think, "Well, that person is unique; that's special." Okay, well, for two things: First of all, in my pre-birth planning, I did ask to have a small, tiny amount of memory, and I did when I was young, but like I said, I forgot it because I didn't want to forget all the way, but I knew that even having a little bit of memory would actually make this life more challenging.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, the contrast would be even higher, having that awareness, so harder to remember than it would be not to. There's this veil of forgetting.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Sorry, I'm interrupting.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: No, exactly. No, please. It's really interesting. It's like it prevents homesickness, actually. So like, near-death experiencers often describe how they feel just so homesick. They just want to go back to the other side because it's so amazing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's what we seek—that wholeness—all the time here. So to know of it consciously, it prompts so much homesickness. It's something I deal with every day with that lens.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Again, I know I'm back in that space with you where it's like it's so difficult to put words to all of this.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: I know, I know.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Sure, and it's not, but you do such an amazing job, so thank you. But it's really interesting, even just watching society at large, how much we are running to actually try and fulfill these voids that we innately feel deep within ourselves.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's to reflect the entire construct in so many ways is looking for synthetic fillings.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, it's not the whole construct; it's just our state of evolution within this level of constraint. So it's a little bit like saying if you lay down on a weight bench and lift, let's say, I don't know, 300 lbs, it's heavy, but that's not to say that it can't be done.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, those who are strong can lift 300 lbs no problem. So I'm just putting it that way because it's not that the construct itself is innately charged or necessitates egoic patterning. It's just that where we have fear, ego will make egoic choices as we try to fill that hole and grasp at straws.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Navigating Fear and the Ego’s Role" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Navigating_Fear_and_the_Ego’s_Role"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Navigating Fear and the Ego’s Role</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he describes fear as a root cause of egoic choices, how separation fuels these patterns, and why choosing love over fear refines consciousness." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_describes_fear_as_a_root_cause_of_egoic_choices,_how_separation_fuels_these_patterns,_and_why_choosing_love_over_fear_refines_consciousness."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he describes fear as a root cause of egoic choices, how separation fuels these patterns, and why choosing love over fear refines consciousness.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And there's a lot of fear. Fear just means yet unevolvedness. It's not a fundamental thing; it's not even based in anything real. It's based in a perception that's not even in alignment with the truth. Okay, but we don't know that. We see a world where we think, "Oh, I could be killed," or "I have no power," or "I'm not worthy of love." You know, we buy into these perceptions really deep down, and then the ego is just the part of us that's going, "Gosh, I need to try to fix that. I'll believe in this and feel better, or I'll secure this object or this money and feel better, or I'll do this drug and feel better," you know, whatever.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's just kind of what the ego does in response to the fear. So, it's really just that we have fear. I'm not making light of it—the only hard thing. But yeah, the interesting thing at this particular juncture is that people might start to feel like, "Oh, is this an invitation to being empathetic to the whole thing to some degree?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: No, no. Yeah, I'd love for you to clarify that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: No, no. Okay, so this life is extremely meaningful. Okay, so let me put it this way: What we truly are is consciousness itself, spirit itself, beingness itself, life itself, and life itself is extremely meaningful. Okay, so then, within life itself, within consciousness itself, this world of form has arisen. We're creating this system.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So the way that we interact with each other here and the way that we express and actualize our true nature is very important. Like, it's so meaningful to bring love into this place and to shine love to each other here versus choosing fear and ego, which is empty and painful. It's very meaningful to align with life, which is of meaning already.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So this is a very meaningful experience, even though the physical world, we could say, is like an illusion. You could say that, but it's a real experience we're having here. You know, and in that, oh my gosh, there's so much potential for meaning, and there is just so much meaning fabric woven into the wall of being—woven into the tapestry of life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Really interesting because you've used the word "true nature" in both spaces, though. Like, we're here on Earth to discover more about true nature, but then also our true nature is ever-present. Um, and I don't want to make it sound like here and there, and maybe you can help clarify that a little bit as well. I'm sure it's not... yeah, there's only one thing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, but do you get what I mean? Like, the engineer in me is like, you know, our true nature, and then we come here to explore our true nature. It's like, aren't we already connected to our true nature? So what are we doing here? Question. There is... okay, so there's only one fundamentally real thing. Okay, so first of all, speaking to the engineering nature, I resonate.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Relationship Between Free Will and Destiny" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Relationship_Between_Free_Will_and_Destiny"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Relationship Between Free Will and Destiny</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he discusses the interplay between pre-planned life themes and free will, showing how individual choices shape the unfolding journey." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_discusses_the_interplay_between_pre-planned_life_themes_and_free_will,_showing_how_individual_choices_shape_the_unfolding_journey."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he discusses the interplay between pre-planned life themes and free will, showing how individual choices shape the unfolding journey.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I worked in nuclear for 20 years—nuclear valve pump manufacturing, project management. I'm also interested in trying to articulate this within duality and to appeal to logic. I'm a logical person; that's very... I'm very passionate about that.

The one thing that is, is beingness itself, consciousness itself, life itself. That is the one thing that is fundamentally real. Okay, so that one thing doesn't actually need to do anything. It's not required to incarnate; it doesn't need to self-limit. But if we can choose to be something that we're not, you see, then in doing that, we add to what we truly are because we've deepened what is possible through manifest creation and deepen what we can know and what we can feel and what we can be.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You see, like, how can you know something without knowing its opposite? How can you truly know what it is to be all if you have an experience being not all? You see, so there's an additive element to what duality offers, and we voluntarily choose to engage that because we see the product, the outcome. You could say—I mean, I don't like making it sound too dry, like transactional—this is not a transactional thing. This is an expansion of being by being something.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And we were discussing long before this life, you met a being of joy and power who inspired you to actually incarnate. Who was this being, and how did that encounter influence your decision to experience physicality?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Well, I can't say who he was as if he had a human name or something, but I can say that I knew that this being had had physical experiences, and he shared with me those experiences.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I telepathically felt the incredible quality of his nature, his essence. It was, oh my gosh, it was amazing. And I mean, I really need to stress this though because the potential refinement that's available to us through such huge limitation is off the charts, and I could see that, and I was super inspired by that. You know, I was like, "Wow, I really, I really want to do that."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I don't know who he was, and it's not like Earth is the only place to incarnate. You know, in fact, I hadn't even been physical at that point in my journey, so I didn't even understand what it meant really. I mean, he showed me, but you don't really know unless you've done it. So yeah, I can't possibly speak to who that being was as if there was an identity I could put a name on in human terms.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, it's really interesting hearing you talk about communication. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what his communication, from what you remember, is like in that space relative to how we communicate here?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Well, here on Earth, we have to like throw sound at each other because we're separate. So right, we experience separation. We're not actually separate, but we experience separation, so we have to like throw words at the other person.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They have to hear the words and compare them against their own memory, and then there's meaning in that. It's very crude, very slow. In higher systems, communication is naturally done telepathically, and that's quite normal and natural because the other person is a part of you. Like, you are individuated; you're still yourselves. You're not like, you know, not you. You are you; you're even more you, in fact, but that you that you are knows that it's connected to them.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so there's not like a barrier; there's no separation to work with, so the sharing is very complete and full and very full of feeling and knowledge and like language-type communication, but it's everything at once. It's very, very thorough and complete, and that's like the natural way of communicating.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: It's really interesting because, I imagine, even if we're communicating in the higher systems, then there is some sense of self or other, but there is... it's like you're describing it's you're a one, and so that... but it's so difficult to wrap your human 3D mind that's so individuated around oneness and still connecting. Are there like... does that... the human mind naturally wants to sort of... are there like dimensions even higher where everything is collectively one?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Okay, so oneness and individuation are not mutually exclusive. Let's just first make sure that's clear because, you know, it's not like you have to be only you and not the whole or the whole and not you. They're simultaneous, but what does happen is we may go to one end of the spectrum or the other experientially. You know, so you may return to a more experiential state of complete oneness, or you may dive in the other direction where we are now, where you experience a state of apparently complete separation, and you don't feel connected at all almost.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, so yes, there are higher systems. Well, in fact, it's the more normal state of being where we know our connectedness. You know, it's tangibly felt and known, and that's a beautiful thing.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Preparing for the Physical Experience" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Preparing_for_the_Physical_Experience"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Preparing for the Physical Experience</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he recounts the pre-birth phase, the excitement of incarnating, and how the soul prepares for the challenges and opportunities of physical reality." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_recounts_the_pre-birth_phase,_the_excitement_of_incarnating,_and_how_the_soul_prepares_for_the_challenges_and_opportunities_of_physical_reality."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he recounts the pre-birth phase, the excitement of incarnating, and how the soul prepares for the challenges and opportunities of physical reality.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, what's it like when you're making the choice to come down here? Is it like you're super excited to play a video game, or is it like taking quite a bit of courage because you just alluded that there's a significant amount of contrast, but you also mentioned opportunity? So yeah, what's... what is it? Is it unique to each individual?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: What's it like? It's unique to each individual. Every soul is unique, so the way that we interact with form is unique. But yes, the... I mean, for me, I can at least say that in my pre-birth experience, the primary feeling was incredible excitement, even though I knew that this experience might totally crush me and it would give me the opportunity to re-experience a fear that in the past had bested me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It had overcome me. So even though that, I knew that it was very likely that I would be... see, I don't want to use the word "forced" because I mean, there is an element of force, right? Because once we're veiled and something happens here, it's consistent; it's persistent; it remains in our face. You know, if we get sick or if somebody dies, you know, it doesn't just go away. You have to deal with it, right?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that's how we experience trauma here, and that's what makes it so challenging. It doesn't just go away if we wanted to instantaneously, but from that perspective, I knew the value of that. You see, I knew that our immortal being was deeper than the pain, deeper than any limitation, deeper than any trauma that might befall me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, in fact, I could see, oh my gosh, there's so much opportunity here. Now, does it take some bravery? Yeah, I mean, the spirit is not... you know, it's not an uninformed decision to come here. I will say that the decision is made from a place where fear is obvious that there's no need to fear. You know, so in that case, you know, that's kind of... I guess you could say that's a form of not seeing it the way we're going to see it here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But on the other hand, in the pre-life review, we experience everything from a first-person point of view. Like, we really review the whole life. Like, we see it all; we feel it all. We are very well informed.

So the way I saw it was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side—this is just a metaphor—but it was like this: If you started at the thick end of the tree, like at the roots, and you worked your way out to the branches, there were millions and millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I could see and review and feel all of them at once, like in a second. Like, it wasn't hard to process all of the... I mean, it sounds crazy from the human point of view, but what consciousness is a ridiculously wide bandwidth. So I could see the whole thing all at once, and I could see what was likely and what was less likely.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, I knew it was very likely that my body would have a major health issue in my 20s, and it would give me a chance to re-experience the fear that I wanted to integrate. You know, I saw... well, I saw there's a lot to it. It's hard to describe, but basically, what's so... what's the thing that chooses the branch? It's free will choice-making—mine and the choice-making of every other player in the game.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, you might choose something that affects me, and then I have to deal with it. But see, that's the value. See, that's the novelty of the simulation is that we might... we don't know exactly what's going to happen. We see all the potentials because the system's super good at predicting, but we don't know exactly what's going to happen.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so then, when things arise, we get to choose how to respond, and wow, that's that novelty is very valuable actually.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, as the minute you laid the tree down and put it horizontal and then mapping out, I started visualizing like 8 billion trees like in all the interdependencies, and my mind kind of just went into a... for what this universe is, was like, wow.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, and then Tom Campbell, the physicist and consciousness explorer Tom Campbell, talks about how many billions of times per second all the simulations' probabilities are recalculated as it sees what's unfolding, as it learns. So and then all of the unactualized paths are also retained.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I know this sounds really mind-blowing, but we call that the Akashic records. So that is the database where everything that we didn't choose—that the system, I mean, it's not complete; it's not infinite, but it's practically infinite. It's so freaking huge. So we can go into that and pull out information and say, "Well, what if I would have made this choice? What would my life have looked like, or what would the lives of other people have looked like?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that's available for us to review post-life because, or even during life, but primarily post-life because there's huge value in seeing that for learning opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Back to today's podcast: Beyond fascinating. Just a struck, really. Um, the... you mentioned the word "simulation" a couple of times now. We're talking about the Akashic records here. Um, you also mentioned... I'm trying to string a few SS into one question here... um, that Earth isn't the only place that we incarnate.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, and when you're using the word like "simulation," I definitely wanted to ask about Maya and the nature of Maya because I think many people say that Maya is an illusion, so it's all not real, but then also in some ways, following your work, it's realer than real, but it's also not real. It's such a trick for the mind to grasp. Um, so yeah.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Concept of Simulation and the Illusion of Matter" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Concept_of_Simulation_and_the_Illusion_of_Matter"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Concept of Simulation and the Illusion of Matter</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he explores the idea of physical reality as a simulation, how quantum mechanics supports probabilistic existence, and how consciousness shapes perceived reality." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_explores_the_idea_of_physical_reality_as_a_simulation,_how_quantum_mechanics_supports_probabilistic_existence,_and_how_consciousness_shapes_perceived_reality."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he explores the idea of physical reality as a simulation, how quantum mechanics supports probabilistic existence, and how consciousness shapes perceived reality.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, so let me try to use a metaphor. Right, okay, so like when you go to sleep at night and you have a dream, you have an experience of something. Maybe it doesn't even make sense, but it's a bunch of symbols and places and stuff happens, and then when you wake up in the morning, it's obvious there was no real dream. Like, you didn't really go to the jungle and get chased by a tiger, but you had an experience, and it, you know, and you might have felt certain feelings, you know, but when but from the perspective of waking up in the morning, it's very obvious that there's no tiger and no jungle.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You don't need somebody to prove it to you; it's self-evident. So that's kind of how it is with the physical simulation, actually, is that it's self-evident from higher perspectives that this is not fundamentally real, but are you having an experience? Oh, yes, you know, and that's something I'm sensitive to when, you know, certain non-dual traditions, you know, may say, "Oh, you're not actually having an experience."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't agree with that because there's a value to having the experience, even if the form that we experience is not fundamentally real. You know, even if you aren't actually your thoughts and you just think of your thoughts, or even if you're not just the body, there's value to being the body and being the thinker. You see, and then and then learning through that, learning of the being by being that, there is value to that experience, even if the form itself is not fundamentally real.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Kind of leads me into a point about the present moment because you emphasize that this moment really adds the power because here you can feel your fears and actually you don't just heal them apparently here; you heal them if I understood your book correctly, like across like multiple places. And maybe you can explain the places or... can you explain that process and how individuals harness... facilitate our spiritual growth?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, sure. This is very difficult to describe as well, but let's just say it this way: So okay, so we like to think in linear time because here we are, and there's a beginning and there's an end. So what do you mean if I do it now, it affects everything? What does that mean? Okay, linear time is part of the simulation, and all so sequence happens at in higher realms and higher systems.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Power of Presence and Conscious Awareness" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Power_of_Presence_and_Conscious_Awareness"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Power of Presence and Conscious Awareness</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he highlights the importance of being present, how the present moment allows transformation, and how awareness reshapes one’s perception of reality." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_highlights_the_importance_of_being_present,_how_the_present_moment_allows_transformation,_and_how_awareness_reshapes_one’s_perception_of_reality."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he highlights the importance of being present, how the present moment allows transformation, and how awareness reshapes one’s perception of reality.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There is a form of sequence, but all this is going to sound crazy, but all now moments are happening in this one now. Okay, so if you can do something in this now, you can't help but touch all the nows because it's all one now. So if you completely accept a fear now, you completely integrate an experience now, you choose love now, you see, you are affecting all other nows that other aspects of yourself may be experiencing too.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is just the now that this is the little now that you're doing it for the big now. The ripples are truly...  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: And is this where you believe quantum and quantum entanglement is all really speaking to and trying to uncover more rooms?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: My understanding of quantum entanglement and quantum manifestation is simply that the quantum is just how we describe the probabilistic simulated nature of our universe arriving.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, it doesn't need to yield data until data is required by consciousness for something in a measurement. Until you ask for something, it doesn't need... like, the forest doesn't need to be there until you look at it. I know that sounds wild, but really, that's what the double-slit... when you know, you talk about the wave versus the slit, you know, how is light both?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, they've done it with Bucky balls, which are carbon atoms, so it's not just light that we're talking about; we're talking about matter. Matter does the same thing. Matter is a wave or a particle depending on whether or not it needs to be measured. You see, so that's because all of matter is simulated.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Sorry, yeah, no, well, I'm interrupting, so I apologize, but I can't help but... like, the first time I got introduced to this, it totally blew my mind because the metaphor that dropped into me was like, am I when you're driving away from your home, your home is no longer like bricks and mortar; it just goes back into an energetic state, and then when you rock back up, it's like matter again.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it's like, is this really...  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Well, yeah, yeah, I would say... I would say don't necessarily think of it as two things because it's not like it changes state. The entire world of form is simulated. That's all. So it doesn't need to change state. It'd be like saying if you sit down to play a video game, all the blocks in Minecraft are just rendered or not depending on whether or not they need to be, and the simulation just remembers really well.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's got, you know, it keeps record of everything, so it knows there's blocks there.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Christian, before I forget, just before we were talking about... um, and I'm jumping back just a little bit, but you mentioned life coming down like, you know, there was a certain sense of fear for yourself, but there was an incredible opportunity. And before the life review, I couldn't help but wanted to ask you a question around it seems like the bigger the challenge, the bigger the fear, the greater the transformation, but it potential transformation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sorry to interrupt.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: No, perfect. Yeah, that's an important distinction because if you... yeah, go ahead.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: My question is like, it sort of eludes souls to be somewhat masochistic in some way. Just... I'm sure that's not the case, and so I just wanted to clear that up.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, sure. No, that's a great... I understand that how that would be perceived. We are not masochistic. So I think a good metaphor is, is a weightlifter masochistic for lifting weights? Well, I mean, you know, no, maybe a little, but like, it's more about it's not about hurting yourself; it's about getting stronger.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, if you go out and go for a run, you don't do that for pain; you do that for health and for vibrancy of being. You see, so it's a little bit like that. Like, why would we choose... now, so if you lay down on a weight bench and you're not conditioned and you try to lift a thousand pounds, it's just going to crush you. It's not going to help. There's no... it's not helpful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so the guides are actually very skilled and evolved at helping us select an optimal level of challenge so that we're at a place where the... I don't mean to make this sound dry, but where the weightlifting is profitable, you know, basically where we can engage a set of circumstances that may challenge us in a certain way that we may actually grow in a meaningful way or serve others in a meaningful way, you know, grow love in some meaningful way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, yeah, so yeah, it's not about masochism; it's about choosing the optimal type of constraint, level of constraint, and those constraints shift day in and day out for all of us. Like, even as the body changes state, like, you know, if the body gets sick, your constraints just change. It's harder to make loving decisions when you're in pain, you know, and every lifetime has its own unique constraints—its unique bodily constraints, the family constraints, the society, you know, the energy of the planet.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Actually, Earth has its own thing going on—its own collective consciousness process and themes. That's all types of definition and constraint that we work with, and so we tend to choose constraints that will be helpful and useful for us. Like, in my case, I chose a life that was going to be a good fit for processing a fear that had bested me before.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the guides brought me this life, actually. They brought me a previous life that was an even better fit than this one, but I had rejected that life just after incarnating while I was still in the womb, and I caused a miscarriage. I know that sounds wild too, but I had a life review for that, and I saw that my fear caused that life to end prematurely.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I still had the same intention to process this certain kind of fear, and so they brought me this life, and this life was like... it was good; it was a good match, but it wasn't like, you know, it wasn't as perfect or near perfect as the first one would have been. So we do have to kind of choose, okay, what's the optimal level of weight, and what kind of weight?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, this is a really fun part to dive into in the conversation. Well, it's all been fun, but the guide conversation starts to open up because even you mentioned you're communicating with beings before incarnating, and you were asking to retain some memory, and then it was like, who were you asking? Who are they? What was like... we're like, what? Like, who are these guys?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, but you mentioned guides, and obviously there's like ascended masters, angels... well, not obviously, there are, but yeah, I'd just like to open the floor to get in here and...  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Guides and Beings Who Assist in Incarnation" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Guides_and_Beings_Who_Assist_in_Incarnation"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Guides and Beings Who Assist in Incarnation</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he describes spiritual guides, their role in pre-birth planning, and how they help souls select experiences optimized for growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_describes_spiritual_guides,_their_role_in_pre-birth_planning,_and_how_they_help_souls_select_experiences_optimized_for_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he describes spiritual guides, their role in pre-birth planning, and how they help souls select experiences optimized for growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, sure. Well, first of all, just a quick about environment because here on Earth, we think reality is environment. You know, that's how we understand reality. Tell me what you visually saw and where you physically were because that's reality.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So tell me that, and now I'll understand. Well, there were definitely visual contexts, and there were definitely places, but it's also way bigger than that. It's also a knowing level connectedness and location that transcends the need for physical visual stimulus.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">At the same time, anyway, I just want to point that out. Okay, so the guides... so I'm not super careful about trying to like put them into buckets, you know, about these guides and those guides, and these are ascended masters and those aren't. I mean, from Earth, we have a very crude, limited understanding of these things in general, broadly speaking.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, but I'll just say that there are more evolved beings that help us, and they may be beings who have had physical experiences like we are having now. They may be beings who haven't, and we may have personal guides. So those are guides that know us really well and are really good in understanding us and understanding the context we signed up for and helping us and nudging us throughout life and watching over us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then there are guides that might visit us for short periods of time that are really, really skilled at a certain kind of qualitative experience, actually. So like, let's say you're dealing with a certain type of personal challenge—a certain emotion, even. There may be a guide who shows up just very briefly because that guide is a master at that. Like, they really understand that; they really get that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So they'll show up because they can see that that's profitable. They'll arrive, and they'll help a little tiny bit. So I'm just pointing that out because I mean, ascended masters, you know, we typically would say that's someone who's evolved so much through the physical that they've basically mastered the game.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They basically have processed and integrated more or less the entirety of the limitations set here. That's, in a sense, mastery. So and they're godlike in power and love because they've come so far. Um, so anyway, just some comments there.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: No, that's profound. And your connection to guides in like when you're in the day-to-day, like, do you connect to your guides? Well, two questions: Are your connections to guides, and then also your connection to God? We haven't even approached the topic of God that you as God...  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, so I'm aware that I have guides, but I do not have common constant interaction. I've had some limited interaction. I had a friend who was able to have out-of-body experiences check in on that a while ago for me, like 10 years ago. I was curious, and he said something like, "They say that you're so intellectual that if they interact with you directly, you'll take what they tell you too much."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so I appreciate that, you know, but I look forward to meeting them someday because I know I've gotten some nudges that have been super helpful for me. Um, but anyway, to the second part of your question, the relationship with God... oh my gosh, I mean, that is like the most intrinsic, meaningful, important relationship for all of us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not just me, you know. We may not know it; we may not know that's the thing we're looking for, but it's like we are a drop in the ocean of all that is. The drop is a part of the ocean; it yearns for the ocean. The ocean knows it best; it is the ocean. So how can you not have a relationship with that?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, of course, practically speaking, what we're talking about really is how deeply form-associated and ego-associated are you because that's obscuring at the human personality level. And I personally feel I have a very strong relationship with God, and I feel that is more alive and thriving now than even in, you know, my religious upbringing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, I had a religious tradition I held dear until about the age of 30, um, but that relationship, that connecting is, oh my gosh, it's the most real thing, and it's absolute joy and bliss, and it's available to all of us when we let go enough sufficiently and when we really look at ourselves deeply enough.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: You're referring to letting go there, and obscurations are really deep fascination of mind because it's... yeah, it's what creates the haze and probably inviting in the conversation. It's interesting because at this particular point in the conversation, it's quite profound because you could feel into someone that's, you know, atheistic.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not necessarily right or wrong; they're just on their own path to some degree, um, and that's what they've chosen to this particular rite, and but also that in some ways could potentially make it somewhat harder even because they don't have that connection to sort of guide them through the journey, uh, but maybe that's what their soul chose for them at this particular point.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Mhm, so the nature of being is connected and a part of God, and so that's okay if then if someone entertains thought form and believes in it—so thought form being in this case an atheistic belief system—it's not like beingness, you know, has a big problem with that. They are beingness; they are entertaining thoughts. They can't not be what they are, you know, and that true nature—back to the term true nature—is always what they are, and it can't be threatened.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so meanwhile, you know, if they... all of us work through some intellectual understanding, through some intellectual context, you know, we understand the world a certain way. Atheism is just one of those ways, and so but form association—that is how deeply we associate with those thoughts—it can practically speaking be obscuring because we fall asleep into being that, you know.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, if you think, "I want a sandwich," at that moment, you are the being who is hungry and wants a sandwich. That's the nature of the thought. You're not all the all; you're not knowing yourself as the stars and the sky. I say that because of my pre-birth experience. Right after incarnating, I had this moment when God showed me what we really are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, the... I not lost my true nature. We have not lost our true nature. This is just so important to lift up, and within me was the sun as an example. I could feel it in my body. It was oh, it's beautiful, raging with bliss. It was so beautiful. That's still there, but if I'm having the thought, "Oh, I have to go to work," or "Put gas in my car," then that's okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">At that moment, that is the thought I am.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How you... hey there, inspired soul! Quick question: What are you taking away from today's incredibly rich conversation? I'd love to hear from you in the comments below. Also, Christian's likely going to come back on the podcast in the future.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What are your questions for Christian that you feel like I didn't get to ask today that you would love answered? Maybe we can collect them and ask them the next time he's on the show.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: When we talk about obfuscation of consciousness, we can talk about form association as a concept.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that is how associated with form are we? How associated with thinking have we become? How associated with the body and its sensory information have we become? How associated with the story or with the understanding? The reason I put it like that is the veil. It doesn't actually separate us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All it does is obscure the active knowing of all of our total self. That's all it does. It's neutral; it's just like a veil. It's just like a cover, and then so it doesn't actually prevent that connection. It's simply that when we don't see the rest, we end up focusing into the physical and focusing on thoughts and forms and story, and then we become that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so that's why, like, young kids, like babies, they're in and out, you know. They have... they go in and out of the body very regularly because they're not deeply form-associated yet, but by the time we get to be like three, four, five, six, you know, okay, now this is who I am; this is my identity, and then that kind of cements it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's a little bit like if you sit in a movie theater and you stare at the movie screen. If you stare really hard and are thinking about the movie, you feel like you're in the movie. Are you actually in the movie? No, you were never actually in the movie. That's kind of how it is with spirit as well.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: It's interesting because almost with the same metaphor, it's like when you first sit down to watch a movie, you're more aware that you're not actually watching a movie. The more you watch the movie, the more you're actually feeling like you're engrossed in the narrative, and you're and you're actually part of it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An interesting part about the forgetting component, um, because it seems like the forgetting and the veil are necessary for you to actually have as deep an experience as possible.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yes, yeah, the veil permits complete immersion or near complete immersion. That's its purpose, you know. If through the veil, you can experience what it's like to be the human. Like, if you want to be the human, you got to be the human, man. You're not the whole; now you're now you're a human.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's the name of the game. That's the nature of the veil is that now you get to experience exactly what it's like to be just this. That's what the veil permits.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, so back to the question. So even at this particular juncture, it feels like certain people that are choosing like an atheist thought form, right, choosing not to believe in God, um, yet they're not even wrong in their own... like, they're not wrong or like wrong or right, but they're not necessarily wrong or right, um, but that's just a choice that they've made that is then it must be somewhat more challenging or like, you know, it's hard to understand because then obviously they don't have that connection in current to God that you described that is the most profound and sacred connection that we carry in our life touch with.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Well, I wouldn't actually name atheism as a unique type. Like, it's not like you lose your connection if you believe you don't have a connection. Uh, the question is, are you buying into any perception that's not in alignment with our true nature? And that happens in far more than atheism, you know.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That happens anytime we buy into a negative self-perception of powerlessness or shame, you know. You know, those are very common examples on Earth of where now we're not the whole; now you are experiencing the vibration of shame or powerlessness. And so atheism is just an example of an intellectual thought form where we believe there's, you know, there's no God.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, you know, that's just one example of kind of, you know, buying into a perception that might not be helpful potentially, but not necessarily.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: It's interesting because there are so many again, we're back to that, you know, the... there are so many thought forms that distract us from our true nature, and it's hard sort of then at this particular point you can't even look at it as good or bad. It's just it's teaching you about your true nature due to the nature of duality and the contrast.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's becoming super clear in this conversation as we're having this conversation, um, the space is quite quite rich and very informative, very stretchy. Learn.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yes, it's a stretch for the physically focused, you know, Earth thinking mind, but for the being, oh my gosh, um, it is all about the expansion of that true nature through knowing something, through being something, through making choices in a rich context. That's yes, that's very valuable, and it's something we keep, you know.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, the form will fall away; the body will fall away; the limitations will fall away. They're not what we are, but you get to keep knowing that. You get to keep the knowing that you took from that forever. You will know what it was like to be whatever you've been, and that is valuable. That's precious. It's precious to the soul.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: At this particular juncture, what do you wish people knew about their true nature that they may have forgotten? What do you wish everybody knew about their nature?  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Significance of Love as a Foundational Truth" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Significance_of_Love_as_a_Foundational_Truth"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Significance of Love as a Foundational Truth</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he emphasizes that love is the fabric of existence, how fear obscures this truth, and why aligning with love is essential for spiritual growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_emphasizes_that_love_is_the_fabric_of_existence,_how_fear_obscures_this_truth,_and_why_aligning_with_love_is_essential_for_spiritual_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he emphasizes that love is the fabric of existence, how fear obscures this truth, and why aligning with love is essential for spiritual growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: I wish that everybody knew that there's nothing to fear. I wish that everybody knew that there's absolutely no reason to fear. I mean, no true reason.

That means, you know, actualizing love and working past the lower vibrations towards a more full expression of our true nature.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's happening now. It's something that the collective consciousness is going through, and that's not just humans; it's actually the whole collective consciousness, but the human race is like a huge part of it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, the question for me is, are we all like... we're always it's interesting because we're always evolving and we're always growing, but yet this particular moment in time seems to be even more so than usual. Is that what I'm hearing is that because then also it brings into like what's going on in the back of my mind is the cycles and the yogas and different ages that we live through?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, is that part of this the shift that we're going through? Does that speak to it underneath a little bit? Yeah, please, I'd love to get your thoughts on that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, so okay, so we can call this period we're going through just the awakening, um, you know, for lack of a better word, and it's just like the act of the play. So what does consciousness do through systems of form? It evolves; it integrates experience, and it grows. That's what it does.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So we're always doing that. Like, you could say that like the expansion of love, the deepening of love and joy, is always happening. Now, it does go through waxing and waning cycles. It doesn't just happen in a straight line. So any given person, any given lifetime, any given species has waves and troughs of experience, and that's just the nature of how consciousness processes out darkness, you could say, but works through experience and evolves upward.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So right now, the Earth is going through like kind of a very rapid transition period where it is seeking to process a whole bunch of old gunk kind of all at once. And you know, when we say it's quick, I mean, the human personality might say, "Well, how quick is it? 'Cause look, everything's kind of a mess and blah blah."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, I don't like that. I mean, one lifetime is a very short amount of time when you're talking about the context of the Earth and even the human race. One generation is like so short, but even within one generation, there has been and will continue to be a huge shift in consciousness—a huge processing out of the old and an increase in vibration so that more and more of our true nature can come and be actualized here on Earth.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: It's interesting because as you're sharing that, I couldn't help but visualize like a sine wave, and I remember I think it was me listening to Alan Watts many years ago, but he mentioned like if you picture the sine wave, you know, there's a line going through the middle, just you know, an axis, and there's life, and then there's the afterlife, and then there's life, and there's before life, and there, you know, it's like there's just the crescent, you know, there's the peaks and the troughs, and you know, because you're mentioning peaks and troughs, I couldn't help but reflect on that.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Evolutionary Cycles of Consciousness" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Evolutionary_Cycles_of_Consciousness"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Evolutionary Cycles of Consciousness</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian Sundberg describes how consciousness moves through cycles of incarnation and expansion, experiencing phases of growth and learning in different realities." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_Sundberg_describes_how_consciousness_moves_through_cycles_of_incarnation_and_expansion,_experiencing_phases_of_growth_and_learning_in_different_realities."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian Sundberg describes how consciousness moves through cycles of incarnation and expansion, experiencing phases of growth and learning in different realities.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Um, yeah, so so we do it not only within a life. Within a life, there are peaks and troughs, but at the level, we do it. The trough, we incarnate down into the lower vibration; the peak, we return, and we process all of that, and you know, we reach even greater heights, and then we decide we want to do it again perhaps, and so we go back down into a trough, and we repeat the cycle.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And in fact, the... let's get too crazy here, but the entire universe even does something like that, you know. Like, we process the entire universe goes through this great out-breath of processing of experience. We're all a part of it, and then eventually it resolves. You could say this is super long periods of time we're talking about now, but we process the entirety of this.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It returns to that state of wholeness and rest, and then we may decide to go through another wave.

It's funny you say that because sometimes when I see the afterlife depicted as like a gray place, like Hades in Greek mythology or something, you know, that is backwards. The human being in the human state is the more dead state. Um, in fact, incarnation is the step that is the hard step.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, that's the lowering of vibration down, the adopting of huge limitation. That's incarnation. Birth. Death is the opposite. Death is release; it's completely complete return to freedom. It's expanding back out. That's not a problem; that's wonderful and beautiful. So you've already done the hard part. The hard part is being here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, not that it has to be hard.

I don't know if this is a real term, but call it the local astral, like some kind of astral level that's very, very close. So we are seeing it, touching it; we're very, we're really, we're right there, but we're not actually in it because we're not incarnated. Okay, so that is not... I wouldn't mix that up.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, when I was sailing through the universe, that was not a pre-incarnate process for me. That was a completely separate, very much earlier experience, whereas later, after I had gone through many incarnations, I was in kind of a specific... oh my gosh, how do you describe this?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Let's say that there is a realm above our own—we'll keep it simple—from which we make the decision to incarnate, and that realm is a realm of living light where information flows very quickly, and it's still lower vibration than potentially higher realms, but it's way higher than the Earth plane.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And from there, there's an interaction with guides, and these decisions can be made because we can review the potential very thoroughly.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, so something just popped in, which was we're talking about... we're talking about the sun, talking about different reincarnations, and in the Hindu philosophy, they say that you know more complex levels of being are a sign of spiritual evolution for one soul.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So like, I'm being super crude here, but you come as a mouse, then you come as a cat, then you come as a dog, then you come as a human, and those people that love cats will be like, "Am, you got that the wrong way around. It's mouse, dog, cat." I won't get into the debate around that. I'm a dog person, so pardon me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, but you go mouse, cat, dog, human, but then also interestingly because we have seen like such an erosion of species on the planet, and yet there is such proliferation of humans at the moment, but it seemed kind of almost like the balance of souls on the planet is probably somewhat the same. It's just there's more humans now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm wondering if there's been if that also points to this awakening that you are speaking to that's happening on the planet. I don't know; I just couldn't help draw those...  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Sure, yeah, interesting. So I mean, I'm not... okay, I will say that the soul requires a certain level of proficiency in order to play a human. It's not like, you know, newbie level. It's pretty involved; it's pretty complex. There's a cognitive experience that is very demanding actually, and that is not to say necessarily that from my perspective, that is not to say categorically that a soul who would incarnate as a human is more evolved than a soul who would incarnate as some other form.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, soul has evolution, and meanwhile, a soul may choose to have certain experiences. So an evolved being could certainly choose to be something that's not human. That's okay. Uh, on the other hand, like I said, a more evolved being is more apt to take on a highly complex life with such a rich cognitive experience and strange depth of separation that we humans experience demand.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, I'm leaning back into your experience of this particular lifetime. Um, you're carrying memories, and as you alluded to earlier, it's formed here that would actually be harder, um, because you'll be aware of the contrast even amongst the dualities. This is like even the contrast. Um, how's that affected you personally in your life if you don't mind me asking?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, like, do you interact with energies or vibrations beyond physical senses?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, it's natural to interact with energy beyond physical senses because as we return to greater awareness of who we really are, um, that's still there even though we're veiled. We're still connected to the whole.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I am energetically sensitive. I do receive... receive is such a bad word... I experience energy interaction with people or other things, or sometimes I'll pull information out of the database not even trying to. Sometimes that's just kind of normal, um, but about my experience, I would say that it is very challenging day-to-day.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The average vibration on Earth is quite low, and I'm very homesick, um, but I do seek to try to allow even this. You know, this is an opportunity. I feel it. I know that this is a huge opportunity for me and for others. I can feel it even though there are days when I'm like, "Wow, this is a lot. I feel like this is a lot."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I still seek to allow and accept even that as a lotus because I know the value of that. So to put it simply, the vibrational difference may be extreme, um, but I also feel the extreme opportunity, and I seek to allow and utilize that the best way I can.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: I must want to apologize for this next question before I even ask it. I've had people reach out to listen to the podcast and touch what it's... it's very humbling to receive some of these messages. You mentioned the word "homesick," and I think that can also allude to people wanting to somewhat check out, you know.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, I guess a lighter way to ask the question would be, how does taking one's own life affect the probability tree that you mentioned earlier? Um, because I think yeah, for some people, they're in some... they're in a really dense, dark place. Um, to like you said, it can be quite dense and dark here, but I think yeah, obviously... well, not obviously, that's the question.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, yeah, so first of all, the probability tree—that would be the end of the probability tree, you know, because the end of the physical life is where that probability tree no longer... you know, that's the definition of death is the end of a life journey.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, now I want to be very sensitive to the question, uh, very sensitive because there's a couple of things going on here at the same time, and these two things need to be said simultaneously. The first, most fundamental level is we are absolutely unconditionally loved no matter what.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Spiritual Implications of Free Will" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Spiritual_Implications_of_Free_Will"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Spiritual Implications of Free Will</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he explains how free will interacts with the soul’s journey, the role of responsibility in decision-making, and the impact of choices on spiritual evolution." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_explains_how_free_will_interacts_with_the_soul’s_journey,_the_role_of_responsibility_in_decision-making,_and_the_impact_of_choices_on_spiritual_evolution."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he explains how free will interacts with the soul’s journey, the role of responsibility in decision-making, and the impact of choices on spiritual evolution.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are unconditionally loved no matter what, and in a sense, there's nothing to forgive, okay? So I have to say that first because even in the context of something as dire as suicide, there is nothing that is beyond unconditional love and beyond the incredible wisdom of source. Nothing, okay?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So we are unconditionally loved; we are free to make choices. Simultaneously, in general, suicide tends to not be an effective way out because it means, in general, generally speaking, that we have fear that we have not processed, and it is because of the fear typically and the rejection that we have chosen suicide.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And we are who we are, and we take who we are with us. You see, so if you're a being who has fear, then just because the life ends doesn't necessarily mean you don't have that anymore. It's still you are, so you might as well face it now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, that is not a judgment; that's not, you know, it's not a damning thing. It's simply that it's not truly an escape in that sense, in that sense. But both of these ideas have to be held simultaneously because the unconditional love and the fact that we are free to make any choice that is... oh, that's all that's true, but we are also responsible for every choice we make, and that is absolutely also true.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">100% responsible—every thought, every action, every intention. We are responsible for so if we choose suicide, that's usually a very destructive choice, not only for the self but for many other people, and we are responsible for that. That's karma is what the word we use for that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It means you are who you are, and the choices that you've made may have had an effect, and that effect stays with you in a sense like because you are who you are, and so it's not wise to choose fear, and that's true whether it's suicide or some other context.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Meaning of Suffering and Fear" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Meaning_of_Suffering_and_Fear"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Meaning of Suffering and Fear</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he explains that suffering stems from fear, how it is a universal human experience, and how transforming fear allows for deeper spiritual realization." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_explains_that_suffering_stems_from_fear,_how_it_is_a_universal_human_experience,_and_how_transforming_fear_allows_for_deeper_spiritual_realization."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he explains that suffering stems from fear, how it is a universal human experience, and how transforming fear allows for deeper spiritual realization.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, I'm not making... I'm actually not drawing a distinction between suicide and other fear-based choices. Fear is always insane; fear is always suboptimal. It's just that suicide is a strong example of high fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Thank you so much for answering that question. Yeah, and the sensitivity you brought to it is... um, looking into a different space just really quickly because I'm conscious of the amount of time we've got left. I remember you saying like on the other side, like you would think that beyond this place, um, like is the substrate of consciousness that it's all built on is like this... it's a space of like it's empty; it's a void; it's you know, um, and yet you... oh no, it's not empty.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Can you describe that?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, yeah, sure. So when I said that, I was like, "Oh yeah, so you know, now we're definitely getting into a topic that from duality is hard to talk about, but let's just put it this way: Consciousness itself, when not engaging any form set, experiences the void."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that means it's like a loading screen. It's like, metaphorically, if you go into your computer and you try to load... you know, you don't load anything; you just got blank nothing. That's the void, and it's kind of a natural stepping point to other reality systems actually because it's like stepping out of one system into the loading screen, and then maybe you go into another reality system.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Who are you in between? You're just consciousness, and by the way, that can be fear-provoking for people because if they think they're the ego protections, and the ego protections get stripped away, all of a sudden, it seems terrifying, but it's not that the void is terrifying; it's that we have fear, and when we look at it, it's terrifying.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Meanwhile, the void can also be experienced as bliss because our true nature is bliss. It's love and peace and joy. That is the fabric of it, okay? And that fabric contains everything, so that's why we say the void is often described as being pregnant.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I've heard that term used for describing the void—the pregnant void. It's nothing, but it also has every potentiality within it. Well, yes, that's because it's a loading screen that hasn't loaded anything yet, but it could load anything and everything that is within beingness.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Everything that is within consciousness is a part of consciousness and could be loaded, and thus it is very pregnant. Does that help?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: It does. It begs the question: Is consciousness just unconditional love in some ways?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: So now you're trying to put a form name on consciousness, and we can't actually do that, um, because consciousness transcends all form. So if we want to know what something is, we say, "Tell me if it's this object or that object; tell me if it's this feeling or that feeling because now I know which one it is."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All objects, all feelings are made of consciousness and arise within consciousness, and consciousness we could say though it's true fabric—the closest words we have are love and peace and freedom and joy. So you have to start with consciousness and then describe love and peace and freedom and joy.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You don't start actually even with some feeling called love. It's just the closest thing we've got, and people who come back from near-death experiences say, "Oh my gosh, it was all love, and God is love, and it's so much love," and they don't know what else to say, but that's the best; that's the closest word we have, but we'd have to magnify it by a trillion trillion trillion trillion to even barely touch the depth of the fullness of that stuff.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Notice I'm not saying that feeling even; it's not it; it's joy and love are of it. You see, it's like it is first—consciousness is first—and joy and love and freedom are like the expression of it. They're like they're what it refracts into in a world of form like ours.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You see, that true nature, when it shines through here, looks like and feels like love and peace and joy and freedom.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: It's so interesting because even at this particular juncture in the conversation, I think for normally, emotions are something that are difficult to point to, but it feels like they're almost like they're almost matter in this conversation. Um, the roles of emotions on our spiritual growth and evolution—can you speak to emotion?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Sure, well, first, let me just say that I don't draw a huge distinction between different forms even though I understand that at the human level, we experience them very differently. So like, sensory data—you know, a sight, a sound, a smell—those are different than a feeling or an idea.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The idea of a sandwich is not the same as seeing a sandwich. Those are different types of form, so I'm just lifting that up though because all of form is transcended. So that's just an important thing to say about the nature of what form is.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I use the word "emotion" differently than the word "feeling." Um, emotion is the way I describe a biochemical feeling. So if you have depression, you have an emotion of pain or sadness or whatever. Is that who you are? No, that's a lie.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And by the way, I just want to go down a little tangent here because when we talk about the suicide question, something I really want to lift up is it's a lie. Like, even though it's very real, that pain, that story, that negative, terrible story—"The pain will never end; you'll never feel better; this is who you are; you're meaningless"—that is a lie.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm not making light of it; I'm not making light of it. I'm just lifting that up, okay? So back to your question: So emotion I would say is like the biochemical experience of a feeling, but the soul—okay, so consciousness can know incredible feeling even without a body.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In fact, it can know feelings that are way off the charts—even more real and more lucid than what we know bodily. The bodily experience is unique in that it is dense and it is novel. So what I mean is like if you put a piece of food in your mouth, you're going to get a taste sensation that you don't know exactly what to expect, and it will show up, and you discover it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's how it feels when you put something in your mouth, whereas in higher systems, when you're connected to all knowing, you might not have that exact same sense of novelty because it's all already there. That's just an example of a unique aspect of human experience.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Emotional Journey and&nbsp;Soul Connection" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Emotional_Journey_and&nbsp;Soul_Connection"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Emotional Journey and&nbsp;Soul Connection</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where&nbsp;the text&nbsp;discusses&nbsp;the significance&nbsp;of emotions&nbsp;as&nbsp;a reflection&nbsp;of feelings&nbsp;at the&nbsp;soul&nbsp;level,&nbsp;emphasizing&nbsp;their importance&nbsp;in the&nbsp;human journey." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where&nbsp;the_text&nbsp;discusses&nbsp;the_significance&nbsp;of_emotions&nbsp;as&nbsp;a_reflection&nbsp;of_feelings&nbsp;at_the&nbsp;soul&nbsp;level,&nbsp;emphasizing&nbsp;their_importance&nbsp;in_the&nbsp;human_journey."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where&nbsp;the text&nbsp;discusses&nbsp;the significance&nbsp;of emotions&nbsp;as&nbsp;a reflection&nbsp;of feelings&nbsp;at the&nbsp;soul&nbsp;level,&nbsp;emphasizing&nbsp;their importance&nbsp;in the&nbsp;human journey.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So emotion is kind of like that at the human level, and it is a very important part of our journey because feeling—which, like I said, emotion is like a biochemical reflection of feeling—it's, you know, with the chemicals and the brain chemistry and all that good stuff—feeling vibration at the soul level, the vibration of feeling, that's like the language of the soul.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's more telling than thoughts and words in certain ways; it's more true. You can't mistake a feeling. Like, it's, you know, you know what I mean? It is what it is; it's saying a certain vibration already.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, but it requires a certain level of, I would say, awareness to be able to feel into your feelings because I think again with the obscurations, I know I keep coming back to them, we sort of... we repress the opportunity to feel in certain ways because it can be uncomfortable to... it again probably to feel certain fears, so we sort of... the ego will cover up fears with hundreds and hundreds of layers.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Sorry to interrupt you. The ego will cover up fears underneath hundreds and hundreds of layers of story and justification. That's just what the ego does. It's we're trying to avoid. So if we want to avoid, here, look at this shiny object; here, look at this belief. Don't look at the feeling.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Feel it to heal it. I love that phrase, and what I mean is if you feel a certain way, let yourself see it; let yourself feel it. The integration of experience is very largely done through feeling. Like, it's not an intellectual process; it's a being-level "I'm willing to feel this" process.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I'm willing to feel this, and I'm going to actually feel it, and holy crap, it feels bigger than me." You see, that's why we lock it away. We lock it away because it feels too big to feel, too big to face. That's why we bury it, swallow it up. It'll swallow you up.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, eventually, you get so sick of being sick or so sick of being afraid that you say, "You know what? I'm gonna face that crap. I'm sick of this. I'm gonna feel that all the way," and it may feel like it's going to destroy you, but it won't.

Consciousness is occurring in... I mean, feeling is occurring in consciousness. Consciousness precedes the feeling; it can't be bigger. So there's nothing we actually can't say yes to and experience and feel, and that requires a certain warriorship of feeling, actually.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We need to be like... not need to be; we can choose to be willing to allow so much of our experience that we feel even the feelings we rejected, even the fears we rejected. It takes a lot of humility; it takes a lot of bravery.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It takes a lot of bravery to actually say, "You know what? I feel like a small little child," or "I feel like I was never loved, and I feel meaningless." Okay, okay, feel it. Go look; go look. The light of your awareness—when you go into that dark closet, you're bringing the light of your awareness into it, and that is how you process it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That is how you heal it. It's about not saying no anymore. Like, one thing I would lift up here is that life itself is not our enemy. Like, the physical reality even is not our enemy. The whole physical experience is not our adversary; it's actually here for us, and it wants us to succeed.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Spirit wants us to succeed. You see, so when we genuinely actually choose to face our crap like for real, we are helped; we are supported, and it may require more bravery than we've ever yielded up until this now moment, but that's okay, and that is a process that is done through feeling, through being a feeling to feel and allowing feeling.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Challenges in Emotional Healing" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Challenges_in_Emotional_Healing"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Challenges in Emotional Healing</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the interviewer and Christian discuss the challenges of emotional healing, particularly how the ego can identify with toxic patterns and behaviors." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_interviewer_and_Christian_discuss_the_challenges_of_emotional_healing,_particularly_how_the_ego_can_identify_with_toxic_patterns_and_behaviors."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the interviewer and Christian discuss the challenges of emotional healing, particularly how the ego can identify with toxic patterns and behaviors.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Back to today's podcast: Feel it to heal it. When we say yes to certain feelings, the ego then quickly latches into then identify. Like, let's just say there's a toxic pattern or behavior, and you say yes to it to feel it, to allow it. How do you navigate the ego then identifying with said toxic pattern or behavior such that that becomes like a coalesced part of your identity rather than once again something that moves through it, actually heals?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: That's a fantastic question because that is the main challenge—call that stickiness. You know, we get really sticky into our ego patterns because of the fear. Okay, here's the thing though; this is really important: You don't have to be able to identify the root fear because you can't.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, when you start down this journey, you can't even tell where you have a misperception. It's buried under 782 layers of crap, like seriously, okay? But there is one active ingredient which you always, always have, and that is: How do you respond to this moment?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Do you say yes to this moment, and do you say yes to the feelings that are arising in this moment? You don't have to understand how they're connected to everything else yet. You don't have to. Are you willing to listen now?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's why quality of intention is so important. You see, because you can't trick your intent. If your intent is to do this to avoid, then that's your intent, and your ego will gladly do that. But if you genuinely want to heal and you genuinely want to own your crap and you genuinely want to be willing to feel and work with your life, work with the universe, work with yourself, and identify where you've blocked yourself—like, if you're genuinely willing to do that, then you just do that with what has arisen in this moment, whatever it is, even if it's hard.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Deeper Self-Connection" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Deeper_Self-Connection"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Deeper Self-Connection</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the text discusses how consistent present moment awareness and emotional acceptance can lead to a deeper connection with oneself." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_text_discusses_how_consistent_present_moment_awareness_and_emotional_acceptance_can_lead_to_a_deeper_connection_with_oneself."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the text discusses how consistent present moment awareness and emotional acceptance can lead to a deeper connection with oneself.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's okay, and as we do that, the deeper parts of us bit by bit say, "Oh, okay, you're working with me here." It's actually one being. The human personality is not separate; it's still you, but at the human level, when you say yes and you're feeling this moment, you're feeling, "Wow, I feel anxiety in my body. I'm just going to feel that. I'm going to feel that and allow that," and you do that in saying yes.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The deeper part of you says, "Okay, I see you're listening," okay, and then another thing may be lifted up to you, and then maybe another thing may be lifted up to you, and because we are basically built to integrate all that and heal all that, we're built to heal.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's like a simple way to put it: Like, your psyche knows more than even if you... this what we call unconscious, you know, I have all this unconscious stuff buried under there.

We just feel what we feel; we know who we are; we feel the fear that we feel, and it's very humbling, but if we're willing to do it, it's also so empowering because if you process that and allow the yes and say yes in this moment, what can affect you?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What can thwart you?

Everything we just said. It means actually choosing love and peace and freedom and joy in your life and actually facing fear and overcoming it and processing it, actually recognizing your own ego patterns and being okay with learning and growing, actually serving the person next to you instead of yourself.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know what I mean? Like that because that... because what is so the fundamental substrate is consciousness, and but what is the fundamental action? Intent, choice-making. So that's why I love the Tom Campbell term "quality of intent."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If you can choose a quality of intention that is more loving under duress, then that's like exercising a spiritual muscle, and now you can exercise that same intention under different circumstances. In fact, in the... okay, so let's make that a little more tangible.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So like, here on Earth, we can't do very much physically. We're pretty limited in the thought-responsive realms. One thought is a thing; it's an action. Intention equals an action. You want to move a tree; you move the tree, and it moves. It's not hard, okay?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But if you can wield an intention that is powerful and pure, then you metaphorically are like a god compared to other beings in that system who have not had to do it under the same level of limitation that you have. So it's like if you can throw a 100-pound weight on Earth, then if you go to a system and someone hands you one pound, it's nothing. It's not hard.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so to the other beings, they see you throw that one pound 100 feet, and they're like, "Oh my gosh, how did you do that?" It's not hard, man. I've been on the weight bench where there was a thousand pounds. That's hard. You see, and so that's what we're doing here with the limitations and with the fear that has arisen from them.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Can we process that? Can we meet this limitation with love and joy and freedom? And note, by the way, that doing that does not require a certain physical outcome. It's a quality of intention, not a scope.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, you don't have to build 10 companies and reach 10 billion people. You know, and there aren't even 10 billion people. I'm just being a bit facetious. I'm just saying that you don't have to think about physical scope. This is about quality of intention. Quality. It's just the quality.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Near-Death Experiences and Unconditional Love" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Near-Death_Experiences_and_Unconditional_Love"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Near-Death Experiences and Unconditional Love</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where a near-death experience is recounted to illustrate the power of unconditional love and the spiritual significance of small acts of kindness." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_a_near-death_experience_is_recounted_to_illustrate_the_power_of_unconditional_love_and_the_spiritual_significance_of_small_acts_of_kindness."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where a near-death experience is recounted to illustrate the power of unconditional love and the spiritual significance of small acts of kindness.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: And I'm reminded of a near-death experience. Every time I quote this, I forget the person's name, and I apologize once again, but this one NDE this person had where they had a life review, and they saw that the most... one of the most celebrated moments of their life was when they were a kid, and their parents stopped at a rest area, and there was a dry tree out of the way next to the car, and they went down to this river, and they were filling up a bucket for their family, and they went out of their way and put water on that dry tree.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Was that a huge scope—watering a tree one time? While in the physical sense, we would say probably not, but spiritually, that was the moment because they did it out of completely unconditional love. They just wanted to serve the tree even though the bucket was heavy. They went over there, and they dumped a little bit of the water out.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You see, the physical is a simulation anyway, but what's not a simulation is consciousness itself and the quality of intent that it refines, and we get to keep that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: The natural question is: how do we improve the quality of our intent? But before I ask that question, I wanted to just highlight the jest that we're under in some ways because they did this study. If I can take a moment just to share, the parable of the Good Samaritan was shared with two groups of people, and then they tracked them. They were actually meant to like someone needed help on the side of the road, and they were tracking to see whether someone hearing the parable of the Good Samaritan, where someone stops to help somebody, impacted if there was a like interactive awareness—whether they actually stopped to help somebody that needed help on the side of the road or whether they just continued on their way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The interesting findings of the study were that hearing the parable or not hearing the parable actually made negligible difference. But actually, what made the biggest difference was the sense of urgency that you had—how much of a rush you were in. If you had the time, you'd actually slow down and help, but because you're busy, you don't. You're just like, "Oh, someone else will get it," you know?  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Improving Quality of Intent" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Improving_Quality_of_Intent"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Improving Quality of Intent</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the interviewer asks about improving the quality of intent, leading to a discussion on the nature of intent and its importance in spiritual growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_interviewer_asks_about_improving_the_quality_of_intent,_leading_to_a_discussion_on_the_nature_of_intent_and_its_importance_in_spiritual_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the interviewer asks about improving the quality of intent, leading to a discussion on the nature of intent and its importance in spiritual growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: And I just wanted to sort of bring that into light because the kind of conditions of 21st-century living—level of constraint, yeah, that's like a level of constraint. Now you're under a time crunch. Do you help them anyway, even under a time crunch? There's a difference between helping when you're under a time crunch and when you're not. One's easier in general, and one's harder in general.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I also want to lift up one subtle point here: the quality of intention is not necessarily behavior. It does mean behavior—quality of intention will mean action. Intention means action; it means it. So if you intend to open your hand, you will open your hand. If you intend to help the person next to you, you will help them. Okay? But we're not actually talking about behavior, just technically speaking. We're talking about the real why—the real quality of why you're doing what you're doing. That's what's important. It's a subtle distinction there, but it's meaningful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Can you elaborate on that a little bit further?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: So, we tend to think in the physical that the output is what matters. We measure things—is it measurable? If we can't measure it in the physical, it's like it didn't happen. Quality of intention precedes physical. It works through physical; it works through thoughts; it works through beliefs; it works through physical actions. But it doesn't necessarily mean the action itself. So what I mean is, two people might take the same action—let's say giving $1,000 to a charity. The first person may be doing it so that they can brag about it or so they want to get a tax break or something. The second person might do it without telling anybody, and they really want to help. The second one is an example of pure—I mean, I'm not trying to judge because these things are hard to judge from here—but a pure quality of intention because it's done out of the true desire to help. You know, it's not done if the person is giving away $1,000 in order to brag. Then that's their intention—to seek self-aggrandizement. So it's not the product; it's not the behavior itself. It's the quality—the why—that's what matters.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: But then even my question that I asked before was like, how do I upgrade the quality of my intention? Isn't that intention somewhat rooted in grade to want to have better qualities of intention as well?  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Ego and Self-Worth" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Ego_and_Self-Worth"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Ego and Self-Worth</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian discusses the ego's role in self-worth and the importance of recognizing one's value as a part of a greater whole." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_discusses_the_ego's_role_in_self-worth_and_the_importance_of_recognizing_one's_value_as_a_part_of_a_greater_whole."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian discusses the ego's role in self-worth and the importance of recognizing one's value as a part of a greater whole.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Okay, so this is a good question, and it's an important question. But I want to just lift up one thing that's kind of dangerous to make the following statement because the ego will get right a hold of this. Okay, so big warning—flashing red letters—ego is going to love this candy. Okay, here we are: you are what is. You are a part of God. Okay? So now I'm lifting that up because you are the thing that is valuable. So wanting to work back towards love and peace and joy and freedom, or to seek greater expression of that, is not necessarily selfish. It's just we are love and peace and freedom, and so wanting to go back towards that is very natural.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, I'm saying that with a huge disclaimer at the front because guess what? The ego will take great hold of that. You're like, "Yeah, see, I'm doing this because I deserve it." Look, the other—this is really key too—because at the same breath, we have to say the following: the other is a part of you. Like, you are them; they are you. So serving the other—it's not just like fluffy altruistic nice—it's logical. It makes sense because they are you. You are serving yourself by serving the other, even if you can't see it at the physical level underneath the veiled experience of separation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: That's really helpful. That's really, really helpful. Singing back when underneath here, there's a thread that was left unpicked at, which was there's nothing to forgive. And I think I just want to draw that back into this space. I think now it can really be just cleared further. I think that's beyond profound.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Freedom and Responsibility" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Freedom_and_Responsibility"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Freedom and Responsibility</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the concept of freedom is discussed, emphasizing the responsibility that comes with it and the importance of making choices from a place of love." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_concept_of_freedom_is_discussed,_emphasizing_the_responsibility_that_comes_with_it_and_the_importance_of_making_choices_from_a_place_of_love."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the concept of freedom is discussed, emphasizing the responsibility that comes with it and the importance of making choices from a place of love.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Yeah, okay, so this is one of those statements again—the ego can pretty quickly get a hold of that because now you're free to do anything you want. And you are—you are actually free to do anything you want. Okay? But here's the thing: there's nothing to forgive because we entered into a state of limitation that we're not. We entered into duress, you could say.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is understood that we have, and in fact, it's respected that we have. It's celebrated that we have. And it seemed that we might make choices that are not optimal. We might make choices out of fear. That is the nature of entering a limitation set. You see, it's the nature of it. So it's all so there's nothing to forgive. If you know that they entered that and then they messed up—well, they entered it knowing they messed up. It'd be like somebody—this is the metaphor—like if someone goes to Mount Everest and they don't make it to the summit because it was too cold and there's no air, do we blame them when they come back down and say, "Man, you screwed up. You really screwed up"? No, no, no. We have so much respect that they did it. We have so much respect that they tried. That's how it is with the human experience or any physical experience, actually. The amount of respect that exists because of the limitations we've taken on is profound.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when we come back, we self-judge. We don't get it. It's not like the judgment is not like Source saying, "You screwed up." No, the life review is us seeing everything that we actually were. And we can just see what we were because guess what? We then experience how we affected everybody else. We experience it firsthand because they are us. So we experience, "How did I actually affect others when I was under these sets of limitations?" And then we judge, "Oh man." And that's why near-death experiencers say when they're in a life review, it's the guides giving love and support to them. You see, it's not judgment from them to us. It's love and support from them to us because they know we're going to go, "Oh my gosh, I messed up." They know we're going to look at our lives and go, "Oh, I can't believe I did that and I hurt this person in a certain way." But there's nothing to forgive. You see, we're so brave that we came into the set of limitation that we could make that choice.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to be loving. No, this is about choosing love. This is not an excuse for the ego to go trump off because you can't escape who you are. If you make egoic choices, then you will face it. You will see that that's who you are. Like in this life, I'm here facing a fear that in a past experience bested me. It crushed me. I've experienced a lot of trauma in this life—a lot of pain. It's not punishment. It's that I have needed to work through it. And I've needed it. It's almost like we don't understand it till we see it firsthand, and then we get to work through it. Yeah, that's an applauded process. It's not a judged process.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: And even the reciprocal for what it invites you into—in terms of, you know, often times we harbor judgment against others, and we're seeking an exchange of forgiveness either way, one way or the other. But to transcend that sort of love—to just understand—so harboring judgment for another is a very—I'm sorry to interrupt—harboring judgment for another is a very common ego action because we think we gain some power in judging that person.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: No, like what I mean is judging them just makes you feel better for some reason. That's ego. That's not what I'm talking about. That's not true justice. True justice is that all are loved and all are healed—100% healed. Only ego would want less than that for someone else.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Your dialogue on justice kind of blew my mind, to be honest. Can you expand about justice because, yeah, I've never really—  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: True justice is that love wins, and love is the truth. Amen. The end. And the reason I say it like that is because all—now, I'm not saying there aren't times when we may need a result from an action. Okay? So like if you walk up and punch someone in the face, they might punch you back in the face because that's their choice, and that's just cause—that's cause and effect. And then you learn because now you got some pain. So I'm not saying that we don't learn and that we shouldn't learn. No, we should learn. But what I'm saying is that the Divine—okay, Source—is extremely wise and intelligent. It's not stupid. It's got ridiculously huge amounts of wisdom, knowledge, love for universes and universes worth. So the laws that are set into place are super, super efficient.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so what I mean is, in the long run—because love is very patient—in the long run, we tend to get the experiences we need to grow past our own limitation and to grow back towards love. And the ultimate justice is that we do. We always return to love. We always return to wholeness and fullness. We are loved. That is the justice. We may temporarily take sojourns into limitations that we can experience how insane love is or fear is so that we don't choose fear anymore. You know, we might have to face it firsthand and suffer, but that's our own unevolvedness. You see, it's not a requirement or something, and it's definitely not a judgment.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Christian, the relationship of the ego—the role of it is—because every spiritual path has its own way of navigating the ego.

Some people use that interchangeably. I don't use those interchangeably because the personality portion of the self doesn't necessarily have to have ego. You can experience being a separate human without an egoic response. You know, you can be love; you can be here; you can be peaceful; you can be free. But ego is just what I describe as the quick part of us that responds in rejection and fear and rises up to grab onto something to make us feel better no matter what it is. It doesn't care. Ego does not care. It just wants to fix the problem.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So now that we feel separate and we feel powerless, here you want—now look, how about this?

See, don't you feel better? That's all ego. It's just the portion of us that is trying to either avoid or disprove the fundamentally negative—like the root negative self-perceptions at the bottom. But they're not even rooted in truth. You see, and the ego's actions don't work ultimately. They may work for a lifetime or even a hundred years or a thousand. They may work for five seconds and then go away. That's because fear is challenging—practically speaking, fear is challenging to work through. We could say very simply, fear is the only hard thing. There's no other hard thing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the ego is just the part of us that's really trying to fix the problem of fear until we really go in there, look at it, and process it. And then the ego evaporates. It doesn't—we don't need that anymore. Like for instance, if you know that you're a super powerful being, and someone flicks you off on the road, you don't need to feel angry. It doesn't make sense because you're not powerless. You see?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, it's interesting. It's almost like a trigger pin cushion in some way—the part of us gets triggered. It's really interesting.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I had a question about senses. I'm not sure where it fit into today's dialogue, but I want to ask—  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Go ahead and ask it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Which was because our five senses seem to be—we've talked a lot about emotions and feelings and intention as well, which kind of lives pre-senses, but yeah, we've got our five senses. Do you see them as something that are like conduits which sort of relay information?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: No, see, are they like actually anchoring us to Maya?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, like yeah.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Senses and Physical Reality" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Senses_and_Physical_Reality"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Senses and Physical Reality</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the interviewer and Christian discuss the role of senses in anchoring individuals to physical reality and the nature of sense data." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_interviewer_and_Christian_discuss_the_role_of_senses_in_anchoring_individuals_to_physical_reality_and_the_nature_of_sense_data."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the interviewer and Christian discuss the role of senses in anchoring individuals to physical reality and the nature of sense data.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Well, they are anchoring us to Maya in the sense that we pay attention to them. So senses just mean sense data. So I'm lifting that up because it's not actually like you—I know this sounds crazy—but you don't actually have eyeballs. You're having the experience of having eyeballs. There's a difference.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so what I mean is—and no, let's even take a step further because it's not even technically the experience of having eyeballs. It's the experience of the idea of having eyes and the experience of the visual image of a face and the experience of light coming through those eyes depending on their health and status of health and then having a visual form experience happening on and in consciousness on and in your awareness. That's what senses are. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And they root us to the physical and to the Maya because we pay so close attention to them. It's like the movie metaphor again—we're staring at the movie screen. We're staring at the senses. There's a great Seth quote from the Seth Speaks books where he says something like, "Physical reality is like a bright point of light that you just never look away from, but you can." I've experienced that when you first start down the path of meditation, you can't—I mean, practically speaking, you generally can't locate that right away. But eventually, as you go down that path and really investigate your consciousness beneath thoughts and beneath sense data, there is a beautiful unfolding that can take place in which you realize, "Oh my gosh, I am not the sense data. I am the spacious awareness that the sense data is arising within."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Christian, you wrote a book—"A Walk in the Physical." How is it—you've actually made it available for people to just come check out. They don't have to pay for it. Can you tell us a little bit about the book and even just why—like what prompted you to write it, how it felt writing it, and where people can access it?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Sure. So the book is called "A Walk in the Physical," and my website is awalkinthephysical.com. The book is available to be read online for free at the third link down on my book page. It's not about money. I just want to share the information. You know, I want us to remind each other of who we really are so we can use this experience to its fullest.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And really, the book arrived to me intuitively in chunks over six years. And it's a reality model, really. It really speaks to what is the human experience—what are we doing here, and why is love so important, and how can we know our true nature so that we can face fear and process it. That's really what the book is. It's nonlinear, kind of references itself throughout, but I felt called that that was the way it needed to be presented. And yeah, it's been very well received. I mean, it's in print, Kindle, and audiobook, and yeah, it's been very widely received. I'm really humbled by that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: And I wanted to ask—so 30 years ago—sorry, when you were 30 years old—years ago, I'm dating you pretty hard there—no problem. But when you were 30 years old, you were practicing meditation. We were just talking about meditation—you're talking about the exploration of the interiors and what's possible there and staring at that point of white light. But can you describe a little bit around—yeah, just your relationship—not just your relationship with meditation, but is it a specific technique that you feel really robust for you in terms of approaching meditation for those that are tuning in and interested in going inwards?  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Christian's Book and Meditation" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Christian's_Book_and_Meditation"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Christian's Book and Meditation</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian discusses his book &quot;A Walk in the Physical&quot; and the importance of meditation in spiritual growth and self-discovery." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_discusses_his_book_&quot;A_Walk_in_the_Physical&quot;_and_the_importance_of_meditation_in_spiritual_growth_and_self-discovery."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian discusses his book "A Walk in the Physical" and the importance of meditation in spiritual growth and self-discovery.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: Sure. Well, first of all, I very highly recommend meditation as a practice. It is extremely full of treasure, even if it does not immediately appear obvious. I very much recommend it. I do recommend an exercise in part four of my book that worked for me. The closest term I think to what it would be called would be Transcendental Meditation, but I'm not sensitive to the type or term because meditation is not really an action process. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It starts as that. It's really a shift in intention. It's a shift in focus, and that may happen through form, through a mantra, through thoughts, through a process, and that's okay. But it actually transcends that. It's actually more about what are you as consciousness doing? Can you take the time in the midst of your busy day and put down everything and just focus on something neutral for 40 minutes as an example? Can you do that? See, that's a choice. That's an intention to do that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when you use your intention in such a way, it actually changes the momentum of how the form arrives to you. You don't know you're doing that. You're not trying to do that. In fact, you're not trying to do anything except very alertly investigate what you are beneath thought. You're just experiencing with full alertness. You're not trying to do anything, but as you do that, the momentum of thoughts that may arrive to you slows, and clarity arises. It may even arise later after you're not meditating. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All of a sudden, you may just have this moment of like, "Wow, clarity or peace may just rise up," and it's so beautiful. And it's the peace that you've always been seeking, and you didn't even know why. And it's so tasty that the ego is immediately like, "Oh my gosh, I got to get that back. How do I grab that? Grab, grab, grab. What was the process? What I got to do that again?" That's what the ego does.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's because, wow, it's what we're looking for is that peace. But that peace is so valuable, and it empowers us to then go into our physical lives and make choices that are more from that place. We're more empowered. You see, we're not lost so much in the small stories anymore. We're much more our full selves experiencing the stories, experiencing the body, and that's okay. That's good. That's very empowering. It's freeing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yeah, thank you for clarifying. And yeah, just the—I guess just to wrap up the question, which is—it's hard not to be in awe when I'm following, tuning in to the reality models, the work that you're sharing, just the probabilities, you know, because everything is probabilistic, you know, and just the fact that you know we get to share in a conversation like this, let alone being incarnate, let alone just all the infinite possibilities, and you sort of collapse possibility into probability, and then probability—but like probabilistically, this is just so off the charts, and then you're having the experience, and you're like, "Wow, you know, it's just hard not to be in awe of everything you're sharing." I just wanted to get a moment from you on just the probability stacked on the probability to the nth degree and like just what life—  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Meditation Techniques" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Meditation_Techniques"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Meditation Techniques</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian shares his approach to meditation, emphasizing the importance of intention and alertness in the practice." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_shares_his_approach_to_meditation,_emphasizing_the_importance_of_intention_and_alertness_in_the_practice."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian shares his approach to meditation, emphasizing the importance of intention and alertness in the practice.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian Sundberg</strong>: No, it's miraculous. Yeah, it's miraculous that we arrive to this moment, that we've done this crazy of a thing—this physical thing—all the way to this moment after thousands of years of choice-making and evolution. We're at this moment. It's pretty amazing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when we say that, it feels amazing. Of course, it's not me or you. What we're saying is we tap in a little bit to the truth. We feel a little bit of the grandeur, the love. When we tap into that intuitively, we go, "Oh my gosh, I recognize that," and then we're reminded, "I'm not actually the human. Holy crap." And that is what's so important about this kind of conversation—is lifting up that we are multi-dimensional beings of love and peace and freedom and joy. And what cooler thing is there to do than to do that here with each other and to remind each other even in the crazy dense physical of who we really are and to know that we can use this however we wish and that we have absolutely nothing to fear. What is more amazing than that?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So that's why I have so much respect for your work. I appreciate all that you've done. Thank you so much for having me on today, brother Christian. Thank you so much for sharing yourself so abundantly here with us today. I know I've taken up just so many questions that you've just had the great—and I think back to the point that you described—it's so hard to point the finger and explain and put words even into like everything we've discussed, and yet you do an amazing, incredible job of putting it so eloquently. It is such a blessing to receive. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I want to thank you for your time and energy here today, of course, and yeah, also you know so many of your own challenges and everything that you've navigated—like your own incarnation in the fears and just speaking to that from such a deep place of authenticity, just sharing that with us. Like, thank you for writing the book, giving it away freely. Just had really, really so much love and respect for the way you share yourself to the world. Thank you.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I've appreciated the energy of what you offer. Like I said, I mean, we focus a lot on the physical while we're here, but the real arena of change is consciousness. It's through the mind. You see, so freeing people through the mind is the most powerful, important service we could do, and it precedes all the physical stuff. Like today's the election unit—that's but all is consciousness. We will change the systems. We will change the voting. We will do that once we ourselves change. So I'm just lifting that up because yeah, that's important.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Inspired soul, you made it through to the end of another incredible episode of Inspired Evolution. Yes, for our life, but then also transcending lifetime, space, dimensions—goodness, such an incredibly rich conversation with Christian.

Also, near-death experiencers themselves sharing their stories—they're going to be on screen now. Take your pick, and yeah, I'll see you in one of those really incredible, insightful conversations as well.

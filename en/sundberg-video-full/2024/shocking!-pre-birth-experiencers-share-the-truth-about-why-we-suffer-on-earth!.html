One was that I was point-blank told that free will is extremely important and that that's like a core part of our existence. But that being said, one thing I saw pretty clearly in my pre-life memories is that we make all sorts of agreements before we come here. Once we agree to some of this stuff, we're obliged to fulfill those agreements. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One example I wanted to share was that I didn't just see some of my own agreements being made but also other people. One particular agreement stands out where this person was looking for a certain benefit of the life that they were about to lead, and they made some arrangements to benefit them. As a consequence or as an agreement, that agreement spanned two lifetimes. It wasn't just for this next lifetime but also one after that, and they're going to be obliged to fulfill that agreement that they've already made.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't see that as a violation of their free will to be compelled to follow through with something they've previously agreed to. So the way I take it is that probably these people who feel like they're being forced or pushed back during their near-death experience, they don't want to come back. I can certainly understand that, but they're compelled to come back because they need to fulfill something that they've already agreed to. So that's my take on it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If we ever were forced to do something, which I don't think is how it works, but hey, maybe then it would be for our benefit. It's nothing too far or anything. It's just something that would benefit us, kind of like when you make a kid go to school. Maybe they don't want to go to school, but you make them go anyway. But I don't think that's the case. I think free will is paramount, and that we're just being compelled to follow through with agreements we previously made.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ary: May I comment on that?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Oh yeah, go ahead.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ary: Thanks. So the agreement is also made with free will. So I agree very much because it's still the same you that's deciding. One thing I'd point out is the levels of the self become difficult to understand from the human perspective because it's like a subset of the whole, but it's still you. It's still the same soul making the choices. So if you, with a broader perspective, agreed to something, it's possible that you at the lower level, so to speak, who may not have full awareness of the whole, is following through on something that you chose. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It may seem to the local portion of the self, the personality portion, that it's not being given a choice when really there's always ultimately choice at the soul level. There is always ultimately choice because, at the soul level, we are a part of source, God, and so the sovereignty is yours already. There's no greater authority, so to speak. So ultimately, at the deepest level, it is always choice. It's always free will. It's just that now we have to shine that free will through choice-making in the context of the personality, whether that be an earthly context or a local reality system that's still close to Earth vibrationally. But we may have different constraints, but it might still be the personality portion of the self. It doesn't really matter so much. We still are making choices and wielding our free will intention from and through that lower level of the self.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Agreeing on Feelings and Influences**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Agreeing_on_Feelings_and_Influences**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Agreeing on Feelings and Influences</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the discussion revolves around the feelings and influences that individuals experience before coming to Earth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_discussion_revolves_around_the_feelings_and_influences_that_individuals_experience_before_coming_to_Earth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the discussion revolves around the feelings and influences that individuals experience before coming to Earth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I just want to say I agree with that. Through the studies of NDEs, I recently did an interview on my channel as well with Wes, and he had like a void-type NDE experience. His experience was about being very hesitant to return to Earth and everything, and how the guide, the guides that they have, are there to answer any questions, to remind them of the commitments and the promises. Sometimes they're not allowed to remember exactly some of those things as they come back. So it's like you're missing a piece of the puzzle, and you're thinking, why did I say yes, even though I was hesitant? Maybe it's because that part has been removed from coming back and what they remember about it because then that would be like probably giving away too much or change their growth experience while they're down here again.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So it makes sense that there's actually like a lot of feelings that remain with these individuals that they didn't want to come back, they didn't want to go back, they felt forced, it felt like they were being heavily influenced and talked into it. Yet there could be things that may have been removed so that's something to consider, that they might not have an active memory over some of those things that they promised or whatnot.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I want to give Melissa and Ary a chance to comment, but I just want to say one thing. One of the main values of the physical is that we are enabled to commit ourselves into a constraint set in which it seems like our power has been removed. It seems like we can't, like once you get into the roller coaster, you can't get out. That is precisely where the value lies because now we're forced to make decisions under constraint so that we can face our own fear and grow. So it's not that that's a bad thing. It's actually kind of built into the design of the simulation, you could say.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Even in my pre-birth experience, I remember this guide coming to me over and over, asking, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" That was not meant as force. It was more like reminding me of my own intention, my own commitment, my own journey. It was more like, "Oh, just reminding you, this is the journey." It's like, "Oh yes," because it's such a huge and vast opportunity that the physical is offering. Sometimes we just need to be kind of nudged back into that. At the personality level, that might seem like there's no choice, but actually, there is.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ary: I just must say I'm so happy and enjoying everything, just hearing different perspectives. I totally agree, and I feel right now my mind being expanded. But when it comes to free will and people feeling forced to reincarnate on Earth, I feel sorry for that. I feel sorry that they perceive things this way, and it is something that bothers them. However, personally, from my own pre-birth experience, I haven't witnessed anybody being forced. Obviously, I can't speak on their behalf, but from what I believe and what I've seen and what I feel, there are things we don't know and we will never know. There are parts that we've forgotten for a reason, and there are parts we will never know for a reason as well.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It helps for people that feel pushed to be here. Maybe if you change your perspective on that and look at that memory as something that reminds you of your free will and to explore what free will is, to experiment in this lifetime with your free will now, maybe that would change the experience on Earth without getting attached to that memory of being forced. Because all you have is now in this life. Even though maybe you were forced, maybe you were not forced, you will never find out. You may find out, you may never find out in this lifetime, but what you can focus on and shift your perspective in this solution and live this life in this life and experience and fully experiment with your free will because we have free will to say no, say yes, your truth, passions, and that free will creates your destiny to move forward. The destiny still has free will, so keep on going.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I would say obviously I do feel and understand where people are coming from with the feeling of being forced and not wanting to reincarnate on Earth. However, when you are on the other side, you don't feel the same way you feel on Earth. So everything you're feeling about that free will, the question you have, is coming from your human self, which Christian has mentioned before. It is because everything has been filtered through the earthly sensation and earthly experiences. That's why you feel some sort of resentment or a negative perception on things because you are coming from this place from the human mind. However, I would say have faith that there is more that you don't know and just keep a question. That would be my take.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I love everything that you guys shared so much, and I'll just briefly say that I have a pre-memory of fully choosing my life and being very excited about it and thinking, "How could anything go wrong? I'm just going to go in and get everything right, and this is going to be fantastic." Then I also had a spontaneous out-of-body experience at the age of 18 after living several difficult years here, not trauma to the extent that some people experience, but I was very depressed and suicidal and faced some challenges. I did not want to come back from that experience. I wanted to stay. Had I been given the choice, I probably wouldn't have returned.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So it kind of highlights what you guys are saying, which is that there could be two different levels to this where a higher part of our soul is choosing an experience for whatever reason, for our growth or for contributing to the expansion of the universe or just to have the experience of love in physical form. But the so-called lower, although I don't like that word, part of maybe our personality or our identification, the character that we're playing here on Earth, may not have that full higher perspective or memory of what we chose once we're experiencing the effects of the veil here.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There's also questions to be asked about what free will is and how far it extends in certain scenarios. For instance, here on Earth, we could argue that we all have free will, but there can be a certain extent where there may be limitations on free will once you've chosen a certain path. There's certain things that we don't understand or we can't fully see here, and we might want our team or our guides or higher power, who is not in a limited physical form like we are here, to step in and kind of guide us and help us make the right choices.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The physical is very dense, and so that just means it gives us the opportunity to face our rejection. Rejection meaning we have fear. So if you think of it like in the context back to the original point we were discussing, it's about having the opportunity to process fear, which is synonymous with the growth of love, what we really are, which is love. Because when we integrate fear and process it, it no longer is the expansion of what's real, which is love. So the denseness of the physical, which includes all the limitations, all the context, all the veiling, all the physical constraints, all the laws of physics, all the laws of our society that we've created for ourselves, like taking tests to go to do surgery, that's all part of the context through which we get to make choices.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So free will means we get to make choices that we can identify. We have to be able to identify it as a choice, and then it has to be permissible within the rules, within the rule set of the simulation, you could say. But within that, we're completely free to choose anything we like, and our choice-making arises from a quality of intention that is either more in alignment with love or true nature or fear, which is association with a non-native negative self-perception and the rejection of it at its root.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So it all ties together because when we talk about, "Oh no, I'm not happy. I don't want to go back," or "I'm not making light of it. I'm not making light of the rigors that are available here. I'm really not." But when we reject that, it's because we yet have fear, and we've come precisely, well, I mean, I'm speaking for myself too, because I came to face fear, but that's part of the name of the game here, is the opportunity to accept something that we once rejected.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So like, how can we have the opportunity to accept it if we're not sometimes nudged either by ourselves or by a friend helping us to have the opportunity to face it? You know, like the reason it's rejected is because it seems bigger than us right now, the circumstance, the illness, the pain, whatever seems bigger than what we can handle right now until we finally turn and face it in a new way and accept it and really process it. So sometimes it benefits us to be nudged to do that, and we always have the choice. It's always free will, like Aaron said. Free will is like the name of the game. What choices are you going to make? That's the bread and butter of what we're doing here is making choices, and it's beautiful, the opportunities even in the rigor.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you so much. We've heard from near-death experiencers that Earth is the hardest planet to incarnate into because of the contrast. What benefit does experiencing this contrast offer to the rest of the universe? In other words, how does our experience in the physical affect the greater web of life beyond our species?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Connection Between Souls and the Universe**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Connection_Between_Souls_and_the_Universe**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Connection Between Souls and the Universe</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Where the broader cosmic context of human life is explored." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_broader_cosmic_context_of_human_life_is_explored."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the broader cosmic context of human life is explored.</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: So I'm getting a feeling that it's great that we're here, that we're getting this opportunity, but also this Earth experience has involved so many other groups and what we think are extraterrestrial groups and things like that, especially with its history and everything. I know personally that I've lived lives in these different groups, and now I'm experiencing a human life, and therefore, it's what's termed as a star seed or whatnot. So I can see this interaction. I can almost see myself multi-dimensionally in that I'm living this human life doing what I'm doing, but I'm also remembering these other lives and the interactions of myself.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I know this is mind-blowing, but like myself as an Arcturian, I feel that connection to that multi-dimensional other life self or what have you, and I feel the guidance from that side as well and the learning that they're experiencing by helping during this time on Earth. So it's very mind-blowing sometimes because I feel like it's all these different people or these different beings, and you're understanding the interaction and how all of it is involved and how it all brings everything closer together in this sort of like almost play or act.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's like even from that side of things where they're maybe serving as a guide or something like that, it's still like a part in a play. So it's very like, yeah, I mean, it's just source, and then all these little characters, you know, and it's like how can we not be affecting other parts of the universe and everything just from like the whole phrase, "As above, so below." And then even like within ourselves, we have our own universe even down to our atom particle. So we have a universe within our own bodies as well, and it's just like you see this mirroring happen, and it's a beautiful progression or whole and seeing how all of it just kind of creates this universal dance together, really.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Aaron: Yeah, I think as we progress spiritually, we begin to realize that we're part of something bigger and that all humanity is connected together. But if we take it to the next level, it should be kind of not too hard to accept that it's not just all of humanity but all of the life on Earth. We're all connected. We're all part of God's plan. And then if you take it to the next level, which I think it's not too hard, it's not just the life on this Earth but the whole universe. All of us are connected together as a part of God, and what we do, how we act, how we think, it affects the people around us, and it actually affects everyone on the planet.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Not just all the people but also all the animals, and then I think on a deeper level, it's not just our planet but the whole universe and all of God. What we think, what we say, what we do, it all affects more than just us. So when we're able to bring those positive Godly traits into the world, love and kindness, that sort of thing, then we can make things better for everybody. And if we bring something negative in, then we're making it more challenging for everyone.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The analogy I think of is if you throw a rock into a pond, the ripple goes out and it ends up affecting every drop of water in that entire pond, and then ultimately it comes back to that rock, and it gets the end result of its own actions. So that's kind of my two cents on it.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Illusion of Separation and the Unity of All Beings**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Illusion_of_Separation_and_the_Unity_of_All_Beings**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Illusion of Separation and the Unity of All Beings</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Where the concept of separation is examined as an illusion." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_concept_of_separation_is_examined_as_an_illusion."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the concept of separation is examined as an illusion.</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Yeah, in summary, it's one thing. There is no separation really. It's one thing, the one source, the one all that is expressing itself and affecting itself in a multitudinous fractal expression of manifest creation. So it's all one thing. The whole idea of separation is kind of non-native. So we assume separation, and then we ask how these separate things affect each other, but we're already coming from an incorrect assumption that there's separation. I mean, it seems to be on the surface, of course, or I mean, we're really going all out into the experience of separation here. We really feel separate from each other. That's what Earth's all about.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But truly, our true nature, consciousness itself, is always connected. It's like metaphorically, it's like one big ocean. And I love your metaphor, Aaron, about the rock in the water sending out ripples, and it affects all the water. It has no choice because it's one pond. So if all that is is like the ocean, you're connected to the whole ocean. So everything you choose, every intention, every thought, every action, of course, whether it be locally through physical interaction or in thought-responsive systems, the interaction of your thoughts with other thought forms, whatever the layer of interaction, it's all connected and affecting each other.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Even the experience of distance is an illusion, right? We tend to think like, "Oh, I'm on Earth, and then there's this really far away place called this world where there's another civilization." No, no, no. There's consciousness having an experience of this place and that place, and that consciousness is one thing. It's all connected. So there's not actually a distance that we need to span to affect each other. That's not a really local non-native level that we built. It's like a simulation, you know.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you for hearing your perspectives. I truly appreciate it, and I'm enjoying listening to all of you. In terms of how hard it is on Earth, from my own experience, when I had an out-of-body experience and I woke up on the other side, I was shown my life up till the moment then. I think I was 23 or 24. I was shown my life, a literal mini life review, and I was given lessons and other people's lessons I have been part of.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the bigger contrast, I was shown that there is always a balance, no matter how hard it is for you or for others. There is always a balance that balances everything out. The suffering, the heaviness of Earth, everything is balanced out. It was shown that we are not about going to Earth. It's about coming out of Earth that is helping the universe expand. It is about coming out of this. You now don't remember who you were before for a reason. You are getting a completely new personality, new soul, new experience, and you come out of Earth. That expands and helps the balance to be there.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There is a giant balance of web. It's there, and it helps. It keeps growing. Let's say your life is hard. That hardness, that suffering, is going to help other souls to balance, to find the balance that it's possible to manipulate the energy on Earth. Earth is dense compared because I've had multiple out-of-body experiences, and manifesting on other realms is so much easier than on Earth. But it is not impossible. It is a bit slower on Earth, but once you manipulate the energy you are giving your thoughts, it is actually easy. It is easy to live in peace. You just don't label life as easy or hard. You just take it as it comes, and you balance. You focus on your energy where you are putting it in. That's when you know how to play the game of Earth, and that helps other souls that are coming. Your experience will help them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But it's the thing about it is I can talk about it, but when all of us are out of this, we will see it for ourselves. We've just forgotten it for now, but we'll see the benefits and how it's serving in a bigger picture. Yeah, I can just say in one sentence, it's all about the balance that we are creating and expansion, and it's all about coming out of this place and growing because we are loving beings. Love means growth. We are creators. We love to create. We love when you love something, it grows. You keep on creating, whether it's art or music. You keep on expanding that thing. It keeps living on. It is all about living on and expanding. So you love this planet, so you come here to help expand the whole picture.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That was awesome. Oh my gosh. I'd like to echo something that you said there when you were talking about it's not about coming to Earth. It's about coming out of Earth, and that's sort of where my thoughts have been on this also. So there's this Sanskrit term, Sat Chit Ananda, which you guys are probably familiar with, which means being, consciousness, bliss. It's this idea of the one being aware, becoming aware. It's hard to talk about it without using time language, but it's this idea that God or source is being what God is and also becoming aware and experiencing that, and that experience of God self is bliss.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So if we think about this entire physical experience and all the universes and multiverses that have been created as part of that experience of source knowing and experiencing the bliss of itself, then what I've gathered from near-death experiencers and pre-birth experiencers who I've asked this question to is that something about going down into the depths of the contrast and experiencing the opposite of that bliss for the purpose of being able to come up out of that, remember who you are, and which allows us to experience more light, more bliss, and higher levels of consciousness.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Uncertainty in Answering Existential Questions**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Uncertainty_in_Answering_Existential_Questions**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Uncertainty in Answering Existential Questions</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the uncertainty in answering profound questions about existence and purpose is discussed." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_uncertainty_in_answering_profound_questions_about_existence_and_purpose_is_discussed."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the uncertainty in answering profound questions about existence and purpose is discussed.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So it's all part of the one thing knowing and experiencing more and more and more of the bliss of existence, the bliss of what it is. Another aspect of it is since we are all part of the one thing, as all of you so eloquently said, when one of us has that experience, we make that blueprint available to every other consciousness in existence. It's like giving them the pathway. Here's what this experience is like. On some level, we have access to that now, and so that's how it benefits the rest of creation. Whether it's world, we've now made more bliss, higher levels of bliss, and deeper levels of existence available to the rest of the universe.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh man, beautifully said. Yeah, and I just get this visual of people almost searching a library on the other side and able to dive into your life and your experience and even see almost like a movie or maybe like an actual, you feel the emotions with it going along with it and able to learn from that perspective because, I think, don't they talk about some souls and how they haven't taken Earth lives? Not all souls have, so perhaps they use that as a preparedness or a studying or something like that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I've always had a memory of an experience like I could be in another soul's presence, and you could almost just expand yourself and kind of let them in and experience what you went through, maybe on Earth or in a different whatever, and it's almost like you could swap or exchange information. I don't know. I just have a memory of that. I miss that so much. I know it was so easy because you didn't have to explain anything. You just had to be like, "Here," and then the next, it's all telepathic. It's instant, and the being is like, "I understand, I understand," like yeah, you know, and they're able to witness that growth or the change or I don't know. There's just so much to share with other beings when we get back, and there's not the confusion or the misunderstanding here. You know, it's just right, perfect communication where you can communicate thoughts and ideas and the whole thing at once. Here, take the whole.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't know. I keep like this is my little prop. It's just rose quartz, but it's so smooth. It's so polished. You know, Earth life is aggravating. You put a stone, something rudimentary or just rough or whatever, and you agitate it a little bit. Earth life, you know, and you come out brighter and shinier and maybe a little bit more polished. You know, it's the same kind of thing. Nobody wants to like nobody really wants to go through that because it's not pleasant, but it's the outcome, right?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I love that. Until my kid's life is like a giant rock tumbler, and all these souls are in there, and as they rub against each other, they polish each other. You know, when a rock pops out, let's say it's not smooth enough, you know, you don't just throw away the rock. You put it back in the rock tumbler. It goes again, and you just keep putting it back until it's sufficiently polished, and then you can put it on the shelf and enjoy the beauty. There you go. That's a great metaphor.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, Melissa, there was one thing you said earlier about the addition to what is. I couldn't say it as eloquently as you just said it, but I just wanted to make a brief comment. In one of my experiences, I was aware that if in a lifetime you could even experience one novel thing, like even just have one novel thought or experience life in one unique way, then your whole life would have been worth it because you've added to what's available and to what is. And that's a wonderful service. It's like performing a gift, a service, just being able to do that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that requires, not requires, but in this case, it means that we have adopted a set of constraints that permit us to potentially do that. You know, and then Rebecca, to your comment about seeing another soul's experience, absolutely. Metaphorically, it's like taking movies off of the shelf, and you can watch the movie firsthand, and it's not like the free will version because you're just watching the recording, you know, in this metaphor. But there's a lot of learning available there, you know, and a lot of us tap into that without knowing what we're doing actually too, like in what we call the Akashic records, just the databases of all the information of all the experience that's actualized in many paths that have not actualized, and it's all there for review and learning, and it's all valuable.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Challenge of Forgetting and Mastering Life**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Challenge_of_Forgetting_and_Mastering_Life**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Challenge of Forgetting and Mastering Life</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Where the difficulties of human incarnation are examined, including why souls forget their purpose after birth and how they can navigate life to fulfill their spiritual objectives." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_difficulties_of_human_incarnation_are_examined,_including_why_souls_forget_their_purpose_after_birth_and_how_they_can_navigate_life_to_fulfill_their_spiritual_objectives."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the difficulties of human incarnation are examined, including why souls forget their purpose after birth and how they can navigate life to fulfill their spiritual objectives.</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Question number three: We've heard that souls line up for an opportunity at physical life, but once we get here, it is so hard, and we forget what we're supposed to be doing. How can we ensure we get this life right? In other words, is there a way to master this experience?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: I like Ary's face as a response, the facial expression she just made. Well, if your question had one correct answer, then it wouldn't be the entire universe of billions of years of experience to integrate it all. Good point. It has a lot of depth. I mean, I think the most simple, it's a huge personal question, and each soul is so unique, but like the simplest most concise way I feel to put that is love, love rather than fear. Because love can mean so many things. It's just one word, and we're just lacking on words. We've got like one word, and it's love, you know, but it means so many things, so many qualities of intention, kindness, and compassion, and strength, and expression, and creativity, and celebration, and all these things, you know, that it means like that all of that is what we're here to actualize, grow, know firsthand, expand.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so like the other side of that coin is like I mentioned before, like processing fear, which just means the parts of us that like we've rejected this life. So we've got these high constraints, so I feel like a significant portion of what you asked about is where have we rejected life? Like where are we where are we miserable, and then we go and we take ownership for that, and we actually seek to actually go into the dark closet and face it and feel it and process it because really our consciousness is deeper than all that deepest crap, and so it can be integrated. Like we really can use this huge contrast for an incredible amount of expansion and integration of experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that's a very personal process for everybody. It means different things for different circumstances, different types of vibrations we're here to process. I mean, it's a very rich question, of course, but I think simply to choose love rather than fear, whatever that means in our lives, and to try to integrate the experience of being here exactly where we are, like not like some big crazy thing, like where are you in your life right now, like right today on a Friday night, you know, like what are you experiencing today? That's what we're here to process and experience and know and see if we can like choose love even here, choose peace like today, even a little bit in the mirror looking while you're brushing your teeth kind of thing, you know, that's where you know, that's how we do it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Aaron: Yeah, I don't view it necessarily as a right way to live life. I don't view it in terms of right or wrong. I view it more as the easiest way for you and others. You know, how can you make this journey that we're going to be going through exactly as easy as possible? Exactly. And like Christian said, love, you know, love God and love other people, and that if you make an attempt to live like that, you're going to make your journey a little bit easier. And what does that really look like in detail? And I saw something recently that really connected with me. You know, how do you love God? Well, God is love. God is kindness. God is compassion. And when you love kindness or compassion or honesty or respect, you're actually loving God. Like that's just how it works because that literally is what God is.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, how do we love others? Well, we through acts of service, empathy, respect, forgiveness, kindness, compassion, and when we exercise all of those things, we are getting it closer to what I think people view as right, which to me means you're taking the easier path, and you're not going to have to go through quite as much difficulty to learn a lesson if you willingly accept that, "Hey, I should be a good, kind person and do the things that I know are right." And I think that's what getting life right looks like when you basically try to live those loving characteristics in action.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And you know, I think we're all here. We're all on this planet. We're all making mistakes. That's just part of what it is to be on this Earth. And not even mistake, but taking the more difficult path. That's really what I how I view it. And you know, if we want to take an easier path, just live those loving traits as well as we can.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: That was a great comment, Aaron. Like love makes sense. It's sane, and fear is insane. Like you could, it's not like, like you said, I agree 100%, it's not like the right way or the wrong way. It's like do you want to do it painfully or less or not, you know, like exactly. It's yourself. Like the other person is yourself too, so do you want to hurt them or not? No, it doesn't make sense to hurt them. It makes sense to love them.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Mastery and Personal Growth**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Mastery_and_Personal_Growth**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Mastery and Personal Growth</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the focus is on addressing the concept of mastery and its role in personal growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_focus_is_on_addressing_the_concept_of_mastery_and_its_role_in_personal_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the focus is on addressing the concept of mastery and its role in personal growth.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Rebecca: Yeah, I kind of wanted to address the mastery part of the question. So I think that's just made kind of like on a soul level before coming down, if that soul wants to master a certain specific whatever it is when in their life, and you can easily kind of tell that in some people's lives when they come down, and they're you know, a virtuoso at like the piano or an instrument or some kind of skill or maybe mastering and going through human emotions or learning about healing by living a life of chronic pain or disease or something like that. Maybe they're learning something like that that's helping them master a certain specific area that their soul wants to explore.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But then I also see other lives that are just like, "I'm just going to come here and be a support to this person," and you know, kind of just enjoy Earth life. You know, I'm not taking this one so seriously that I have to do this whole to-do list of things that I need to learn or whatever. I've seen these different themes per person, and you can just tell by the people that you've met in your life. They seem just, you know, the way that their lives have gone, and the lessons that have been brought to them and everything. There's also the kind of life that's like, "Okay, I'm on the diving board. I've never dove before. Let's just do it," and they belly flop, and it hurts. You know, they're like, "I'm just going to jump into this Earth life, and whatever happens, happens." You know, and they learned just from that experience, but there was no mastery involved in that. Right? That was just like, "Let's do it. Let's jump into it." You know, but it's still valuable.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And you know, I again, I just want to reiterate like I think it really comes down to what that soul wants to experience mastery-wise before they come down here. And again, that is all part of that free choice. Maybe they just really want to explore that option because it's a direction they feel like they want to go. Maybe they feel that that rounds out a part of their soul purpose or something. So yeah, that's a great question.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ary: It is a funny question in terms of mastering the life. Help you master the life and take this life lightly because you will never master this life. This life is so short. It will take your lifetimes to master whatever you want to master here. And just do your best because we are all doing our best and teaching each other. The second thing I would say is treat everybody you meet as your teachers. You meet everybody in this life, and you are their teacher. They are your teacher. Always respect them and have compassion. Compassion is something I would say that will take you through this life lightly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And love everybody. And I know this love word, as Christian mentioned, has such a big meaning that we just have this whole letter, love, and it doesn't fully explain loving somebody means you accept them, you forgive them, you support them, you cherish them, you appreciate them, you respect them. You don't manipulate, you don't hurt them, you don't betray, you don't control, you don't manipulate. These things aren't love. The opposite of it is love. So once you give love to yourself, you'll be able to love other people and also learn from them openly with an open heart and open mind.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When it comes to forgetting things, you never forget. You never forget who you are. You never forget anything when you incarnate. The way you are living this life is you remembering actually. So you are living and remembering everything you've gathered up till this moment now. Every wisdom and insight is you remembering through different life experiences. So you never forget. It's always in your heart. It always guides you. You've always got the support from your spirit guides, the universe, and from people that are here on Earth as your teachers. And if you feel lost, you can always ask questions, and answers will be revealed. You can always ask because everybody's a teacher.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You can go ask Melissa, "What do you think about this?" and she'll tell me something that will help me, that will give me a different perspective. I can just like that. You can go to different people and see that you are one. We are always learning together. I would say, and just time who you want to be in every moment. Wake up and ask yourself who you want to be, how do you want to talk, how do you want to act, what kinds of beliefs you want to have, how you want to treat others, and how you want to be treated. And it's a continuous lesson of becoming who you want to be in this world, in this lifetime.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I would say give up the mastery and live as a beginner because this life is our learning to be honest. I'm learning to drive. I'm a beginner in everything. I'm learning to cook, and all of those things. Treat this life as a beginner. You're creating a completely different perspective, and you are serving in a big collective purpose on a giant level. But don't focus too much on that. Just focus on what you can do right now and who you are right now and what you can do that will help you a lot to quite fully.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I've heard someone say angels can fly because they take everything lightly. They don't carry baggage. So don't get attached to anything and accept life as it is. Life has a rhythm. It has ups and downs and twists and circles and everything zigzags because life is life. Life is for living. Life is not for mastering. And whatever you take out of this life, that is it. That's what you take out of this life. But don't worry about it much. This end, the learning, focus on what you can do and who you want to be. That's what I would say.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All of you made such profound points to me, and each of them slightly different but in like bringing a different perspective of the same thing that I think everybody is saying. And I would also add that the great masters, like the great Hindu masters, the great mystics, different traditions have talked about how the way to become self-realized or really to awaken from the dream is to become very, very present. And like each of you are saying with your own words, it's about not trying to master the experience. Ary, that was such a great point. It's not that there is one right or wrong way to do this and that there is or there is one specific purpose that we're all here to do.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like Rebecca, like you were saying, there's so many different reasons that people could have chosen different experiences, but it's about actually just being present in the experience, which comes back to Christian's point, which is love. And I think that's what we're all saying because love is accepting what is. It's one of my favorite spiritual teachers, Adyashanti, says enlightenment is just having a loving relationship with everything, and that includes yourself, your thoughts, your emotions, the thoughts and emotions of others, not judging it as a right or wrong or a good or bad experience but just being present with it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I think that if there's one way to master the experience, then that would probably be it, is to just be present in the experience without having any attachment or judgment to it and without having any attachment or judgment to whether or not we want to be here or come back, which is another thing that comes up.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Does anyone have anything else to say about that topic, or should we move on?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: I'll add a quote by Rumi: "Wherever you are, whatever you do, just be in love. Be fully in love with everything in the crazy."</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Why Do We Experience Extreme Suffering?**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Why_Do_We_Experience_Extreme_Suffering?**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Why Do We Experience Extreme Suffering?</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Where the necessity of suffering is questioned, and the speakers discuss whether extreme hardships are truly required for spiritual growth." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_necessity_of_suffering_is_questioned,_and_the_speakers_discuss_whether_extreme_hardships_are_truly_required_for_spiritual_growth."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the necessity of suffering is questioned, and the speakers discuss whether extreme hardships are truly required for spiritual growth.</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All right, question number four: Many people understand the necessity of contrast for growth and yet question the degree of suffering that we endure here. So in your experience or opinion, why do we have to suffer to the extreme degree that we do on Earth?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: I feel it's never a "have to." You know, a lot of times when this question is asked, it's why do we have to be put through so much misery? So like, you know, like fear is misery is a simple way that you could put that. Like when we reject life and when we associate with ego and when we like become the thing that we're not, which is this little small person who's powerless but is really striving to grab some fake power however we can by judging the person next to us or getting some identity or some money or whatever else, that's suffering.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, when we associate with thinking, thinking itself, the small "I," the small "I am just this person who has to do this thing," that is like a form of suffering. And our universe gives us the opportunity to fall really deeply into that because it's so dense. It has the ability to prompt the opportunity to prompt potentially very negative self-perceptions. So what I mean is like I feel powerless, or I feel unworthy of love, or I feel not free. Those are some of the really big ones on Earth, the themes that are really deep in us. Those are not true.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so like when we but when we believe that and then when we act in fear as a response to that, that causes all sorts of shenanigans, all sorts of suffering. So I'm pointing that as suffering versus pain. You know, physical pain itself will happen within the human experience. It's part of the context. But even great physical pain, I know this sounds contentious, the ego may not like this, but even great physical pain is actually neutral when it arrives. It's not actually charged yet. It's just a sensation. We apply the meaning. You see, we apply the suffering when we buy into the fear-based interpretation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So it's not that it has to be that. It's that where we have fear, we may get wrapped up in something that we're not really deeply, and that can hurt like hell. So really, I find I feel that question is synonymous with why do we have such an opportunity to have such a deep experience of potential expansion? You see, like but but ultimately, like I think it's really, really, really important to point out though, like the fundamental substrate of existence, the thing that always remains is love and peace and joy. Like that's what we're made of. Even when the contrast may seem ridiculously extreme, the substrate of all that experience is still what it is. It never actually can be truly changed or challenged. It only can apparently be deeply challenged, and what we're doing here is pushing the boundaries for how far we can create a simulation that challenges us in that way.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But are we ever truly in danger? No.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Aaron: Yeah, I see it. Why is life so difficult? Well, because that's what's needed for us to grow quickly. You know, if life was real easy and it never challenged us, well, then our growth would be pretty small. But by undergoing all these challenges of this earthly existence, we're able to speed up our growth, our spiritual growth so much that we ourselves deemed it worthwhile. Yes, it's kind of like ripping off a Band-Aid. You know, you just kind of get it over with quick, and that's kind of what coming to Earth is like. It's difficult. I'm not one to minimize anybody's pain and suffering because I know it can be very difficult, but the corresponding growth that we get from that difficulty, which we don't even realize, is significant. And so significant that we ourselves thought it was worthwhile.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I think that's the reason why Earth is so difficult is because we can get our training, our education, the experiences that we need to become the kind of souls we're supposed to be. We can get it very quickly and then move on to the happier, more joyful existence that awaits us all. We can just move through this faster and get to the good stuff. And so that's why I view Earth as being as difficult as it is.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Yeah, I just want to comment that I agree 100%, Aaron. And I feel like there's a very simple crude metaphor on Earth might be like why would you lay down on a weight bench and lift 200 lbs? Why would you do that? Well, you know, because you get stronger faster. Like it's not that the 200 pounds is even native to you, but it provides one heck of an opportunity if you can push it up. It might crush your chest for a bit till you push it up, but like it's an opportunity. It's not like, "Oh, we're doomed to this ultimate suffering here we are." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, no, it's just we agree, we chose, we chose this, man, like to come here because like I remember being so excited by the contrast. And I knew I was biting off a piece of sandwich that was so freaking big that it would probably break me at the personality level. I knew that I was like, "Oh my gosh, let's do it, man. Let's do it. I know I can do it. It's bigger than I've ever like you know, like a bigger piece of sandwich." This is a terrible metaphor, but it's the only thing I can think of. Like you know, the bite of contrast was I knew it would be so challenging that it might crush me, but I knew that that meant a huge potential not only for my own growth but for the whole. I was serving the whole by biting off a big piece of sandwich. So anyway, yeah, I love the way you described that, sir.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Rebecca: Yeah, that's beautiful. The visual I'm getting is like a rubber band, and how deep and that you pull back is going to launch you farther, right? So how far do you want to pull that kind of thing? So part of my pre-birth experience, I remembered kind of like a two-part thing about choosing this life. One, I wanted to be here to help the planet, kind of raise vibration, you know, that whole experience of helping. So I do remember volunteering, and then I do remember going into the planning room where I met with my family soul group, right? And each of them had a specific way they wanted their lives to go and to happen and to change and everything, but somebody had to really take the brunt of it, which translated to me as a traumatic, abusive childhood.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I do remember agreeing to that so that I could help all these beautiful souls with their goals, and I remember just feeling that love so much for them that I was so willing to do that. And trust me when I say there's so many times where I'm in right here who I am now that I'm like, "What was I thinking? Oh my gosh, you know, what did I sign up for? That was a lot harder than I expected," you know, that sort of thing. And but still, that love, that deep remembrance, I think this pre-birth memory came to me, came back to me in knowing because it helped me with healing the abuse and understanding why I had to have such a traumatic childhood.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And you know, there's so many close calls where I almost didn't make it, you know, and staying here, and I was like, "Why would that be designed to be that close, you know, where I would maybe make certain decisions that would end my life here?" You know, it's like it really took it close, but when I see this family generational line, it's like I can see the beauty in the opportunity that it has presented so many souls. And then just also being here and being of service and helping other souls through their traumatic childhoods, right? We mentioned previously giving that blueprint of how to get through it, right? Here's a really steep mountain trail. Nobody's decided to climb it yet. You know, "Oh, I'll do it," like what, you know, don't turn left here like I did, you know, that sort of thing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The word trailblazer comes to mind. I think there's some of us as souls that we are literal trailblazers when it comes to coming down here and being like, "We just want to take off, you know, and maybe it's we've had some soul experience behind us or I don't even know it all. I know is that there's this desire to help and to love, right, and to heal. And by heal, I mean just remembering oneness and love because that's really what it is. Healing is really just peeling off those layers, right, in remembering our oneness.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So yeah, I just want to kind of also let the audience know too, it's like you know, we've some of us have dealt with some really heavy stuff, and you know, where we came from Orthodox beliefs, religion, that kind of thing. We made a moral transition right, and we planned that kind of diversity, you know, that challenge so that it would launch us into being able to be of service. And that at the end of the day is my reminder.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I currently deal with depression on a daily basis. I am treated for depression, and I have mental illness on both sides of my father's side, my mother's side, and that is something that I deal with. And it's like, "How do I keep going, you know, and how do I, what is my purpose for being here?" And this is my remembrance. This is my purpose because there's others like those out there that struggle like this, and they have chosen what they feel like such dark themes in their life or struggles or such heavy, heavy issues and themes. And how can you be spiritual, you know? It almost feels like too much of a contrast, right? Somebody's got to be there to show that, "Hey, I took this little step one by one, and this is how I was able to get through it." We need more examples of that because that's what keeps us going and connected.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Purpose of Suffering and Healing Through Experience**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Purpose_of_Suffering_and_Healing_Through_Experience**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Purpose of Suffering and Healing Through Experience</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Where suffering is redefined as an opportunity for healing and transformation." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_suffering_is_redefined_as_an_opportunity_for_healing_and_transformation."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where suffering is redefined as an opportunity for healing and transformation.</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ary: I don't really like the word suffering. Suffering comes from an attachment to the pain. So when you have pain and you attach to that, you always bring it up as suffering. "I've suffered there, I've suffered there, I've gone through this and this," because you are attached to that pain. You made it a part of your identity. There is a lesson in everything, and I think and I feel like nature has given us the clue to our physical bodies. When you get a wound, when you cut yourself, your body heals on its own, but you also have to play a role by getting it clean, taking care of yourself to speed it up. But everything on Earth, everything here is here to nurture you, help you heal, and help you grow.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And when you don't focus on why it happened but how can you heal yourself, how can you get something out of this experience, and how can you move on, then the answers will come to you, and you will then see the impact of that healing on other people. The healed person of you, the one that has gained the insight from that suffering, from that pain and experience, will be able to help other people. And everybody, you'll be able to provide a safe environment for others to you, and you'll be able to share what helped you as well.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So in short, I would say yes, you will have to go through some things that are in your contract or some things that have been passed on by your parents, by your grandparents, some traumas that have been passed on to you. You are responsible, but you can't blame them. But you are now responsible for working on them, for getting through them, and expanding yourself. I can tell you for sure that the other side of the suffering is so beautiful, and it's so worth it, and it's worth going for. So whatever you suffer, you attach to the pain. Don't just question why it has to be you, but understand that it has to be you because you can go through it. You are able to look and flip to the other beautiful side of it and share that side with everybody. So someone has to go through that, and if you've been chosen, I would say just shift how you see things and see it as a chance for you to expand more.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it's all about on this planet, especially on Earth, it's all about managing your energy. Whatever you want to focus on, the wording you choose, how you want to do things, how you want to perceive things. Sometimes you've suffered through something, but your memories can't change it. It's in the past. You are in the present moment that no longer exists. So everything is actually can be neutral. It's whatever you attach to that experience, into that memory. You can always flip the coin by saying, "Yes, I had this accident where I suffered and I lost this and this, but you can also say, "I have experienced this, and that has changed my life and made me who I am today, and these are the things I've learned." You can always change your wording and how you see things, and you will not see it as suffering but just an experience and part of your journey.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Why do we have to suffer? You can choose to accept life as it is. Life has hardships that they serve, and they are balanced by the other side of it by learning to just take whole life as life is life. It's very divided into suffering, and it has this, and it has a contrast. That contrast actually needs a balance. So that is it for me.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you so much to each of you for sharing. I will admit that this is a question I tend not to speak to too much simply because there are people in the world who have suffered so much more deeply than I have. I know a couple of you here have experienced, you shared with me your interviews, trauma beyond what I had experienced in my childhood, and people around the world are suffering horrific things that I personally couldn't imagine. And I think that the appropriate response to somebody who is suffering is not to try to answer the question of why but simply to be present and hold space for their experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But for those who are genuinely asking this question because they're interested in higher answers, from a human perspective, perhaps there is no good answer, but from a higher perspective, in my experience and the experience of those that I've spoken to, my best attempt to answer this question would be to say that because Earth is specifically designed to experience really deep contrast, and it plays a specific role of allowing us to advance our spiritual evolution in a fast-forward manner, like you mentioned, Aaron, and to deep like higher highs, we're trying to reach the higher highs here, that's why we experience some of the deepest lows here. And that those people who do choose to take on those experiences for the benefit of the rest of us are incredibly brave souls, and I give them my gratitude.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you, Melissa. There was also one other thing I wanted to share. The power that I have learned with my own mind in my own recovery has just blown me away, and managing chronic pain and all of these things that have come up, I have learned so much about neuroplasticity because we can shape and mold our brain. We can constantly keep it growing and learning new things. You know, there's so many things that we're getting into with regard to trauma and recovery that we're just tapping into now, and it's really exciting. And to be able to grow and learn and to be able to test it out, you know, it's it feels very like a guinea pig, but it's also such an exciting period because you can really see, feel like what works for you.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I feel like it's a kind of like almost a never-ending theme in terms of being able to try different things in terms of like with trauma recovery, and I'm very open to the different things that you know come out. Some of them not so great, some of them may work, you know, and it's all part of that healing journey and sharing that with others. But I just wanted to give others hope that there is so much you can do with your own mind, including just education and learning about your energetic body and you know just all of that. There's just put it to use, and you will take charge of your, I guess you would say, suffering, and it won't feel like suffering anymore. It'll feel like another opportunity to be able to work through like pain management, for instance, yeah, and using like the different tricks and tips and things like that that you can learn with changing your neuropathways. It's pretty cool stuff.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Bringing Bliss and Peace Into This World**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Bringing_Bliss_and_Peace_Into_This_World**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Bringing Bliss and Peace Into This World</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Where practical methods for experiencing the deep love and peace felt in pre-birth or near-death experiences are discussed." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_practical_methods_for_experiencing_the_deep_love_and_peace_felt_in_pre-birth_or_near-death_experiences_are_discussed."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where practical methods for experiencing the deep love and peace felt in pre-birth or near-death experiences are discussed.</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So great comment.

I tried ketamine infusions, which did nothing for my depression unfortunately, but the trips themselves brought me to that oneness. Like if you've done cacao ceremony circles or you know, it's just like having like your little mug of chocolate, you know, that's been very like a milder form.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So definitely, there's ways where they actually made me feel absolutely horrible at first but then brought me into like an amazing experience of feeling that oneness. But I don't necessarily have to do that again. I'm able to do that through meditation, you know, and music 100%. Music for me is I could just hit, and I know if I had a piano here, I'd do it. I go straight to my chord, and this chord that I play, it feels like my home resonance. I don't know how to describe it other than like this sounds like the frequency that I am used to hearing whenever I get goosebumps when I listen to certain music or changes, and like that is just immediately feeling like I am there with source and creation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A lot of my dream-like scenarios are also you know that we've that I'm sure a lot of us have had where we either meet with an angel or a guide or even just flying dreams. Those are also like just that much more closer feeling like beyond or human like what seems like our limitations or whatnot. So these are all you know kinds of ways of doing it, but yeah, absolutely like music and binaural beats and meditation, you know, and maybe I guess that monkey mind that we all have, right, kind of put that aside, and then we can be more open to you know these esoteric experiences. Those are some ways that I've kind of explored it, and it's fun. It really is. And sometimes it's just a walk in nature. You don't really need to be extreme, you know.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Aaron: Well, I'll share. You know, there was a couple portions of my experience where it was really amazing, you know, very, very happy. I couldn't describe it. And for me, I don't know of any way to bring that kind of joy and happiness into this level of existence. So I don't really have any good answer for how to do that, only that I wish I could because you know parts of my experience were just amazing, and I look forward to getting back to that when it's my time.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Yeah, so I feel the question is a bit tricky because as humans, we focus on form, things, objects, actions, substances. You know, tell me the way, tell me the action I can take, you know, I'll go do that thing. The bliss of being is what we actually already are. So like Rebecca when she described music or nature or even flying in a dream, as we resonate back closer to the full freedom of our nature or we resonate with an expression of creative like some creative expression, whether it be music or a sunset or the living presence of nature, that resonance vibrationally moves us closer to who we are, maybe a small amount, maybe a large amount, because we are now like returning vibrationally through that perception and that perspective back to like what can be thought of perhaps as a more mechanical process.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But when we actually let go of the forms of the mind and dwell fully in beingness itself, it rises up all on its own back to us. That bliss is what we already are. It never actually left. It never actually went anywhere. So but then we want to say, "Well, how do I do that?" Well, again, that's like it's quite a trick of a question because that implies that some form is going to get you there. And the thing is, spirit itself transcends all form. We may change the form constraints like when we take drugs or have some kind of physical alteration of the biochemical constraint set that we're wearing. That can change the constraints, but meanwhile, we're not the form. The form is arising in us. The experience of the body, the sensory information, the thoughts, the distance, all the things, it's all arising within consciousness.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then when we lose ourselves in the things that we're not, that's the confusion. So the question is a little bit like saying, "How do we be who we really are?" Well, let go of what you're not, or choose something here that is more you, all the way free, like some expression of freedom and joy and love now here today. Like if you put it this way, if you're the real you, you will know bliss. Like if you just in whatever way, if you're the real you, just exactly who you are underneath all the crap, the real you, that is bliss. So then you say, "Well, how do we find that? How do you be you?" So how can we bring that giving of peace and bliss you felt in your pre-birth memory here now?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I will agree with what Christian has said in terms of it's about being present now, practically speaking, because I feel like this question was from somebody who wants a practical answer. Sometimes you tell somebody, "Be who you are, be yourself," and they just like, "What is that?" So practically speaking, being present allows you to be in that place already because that is the foundation. Peace is your foundation. Peace and love is your foundation. That's who you are. Now you've got these layers and layers of limited beliefs and those things that are from this world and from your parents and social beliefs and things that are preventing you from exploring who you truly are.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now there are some practices that will allow you to experience peace and freedom and experiment with them, and those are spiritual practices that Rebecca has told us about, which is art, music, crafting, creating, poetry, writing, gardening. It is all creative practices because you are a creator. You are the creator. You are the universe. That is who you are. You love to create, and when you start creating, that's when you explore your freedom. That's when you expand, and you are fully present. You start appreciating little things about nature, every flower, bird, what they are, their true nature, and that's when you become more and more present without yourself knowing that you are doing those things to be more present. It's just those practices that allow you to strengthen your spiritual element.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We have five elements in nature, and the main element is the spiritual element. That's who you are. That is what activates the other elements. So through those practices, they will help you become more present. And in terms of how to be present, it's all about managing your energy and thoughts and what you give energy to. You can definitely choose your thoughts and what you want to be, who you want to be, what beliefs you want to have. But in order to do that, once again, you have to meditate. Meditation is not going to solve it instantly, but it's a long-term investment. It is something you have to keep on doing, two minutes, five minutes a day. Be still, be silent, and feel the life force energy that is running through you, and you'll be able to feel that energy in everybody.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I would say just know that peace is the foundation, and that is your foundation. Try to work with everything that is not allowing you to be at your peace, in your peace, and mainly meditation is something that will help you to be more present and just engaged with whatever you are doing, wherever you are, with whoever you're speaking. Be engaged.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Importance of Presence, Love, and Surrender**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Importance_of_Presence,_Love,_and_Surrender**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Importance of Presence, Love, and Surrender</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Where the value of being fully present is emphasized as a way to connect with one's true self." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_value_of_being_fully_present_is_emphasized_as_a_way_to_connect_with_one's_true_self."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the value of being fully present is emphasized as a way to connect with one's true self.</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Yeah, thank you, Ary. That was beautiful. I want to reiterate too that meditation is like if we have to pick one activity that's a really that's like the one because we if we as we choose wield and attention as we set aside time to choose to focus well at first on something neutral just so we can control our focus but then just fully on the aliveness that's present here now. And like Ary said, it doesn't have to be super long, three even three or five minutes or 20 minutes or 40 minutes, whatever. Set aside the time, and it like by choosing to take the time and the energy and to focus it away from the form back to the aliveness, that choice of yours to spend that time and to spend that energy to turn back inward, that's powerful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And as we do that like over time, we grow in an experiential knowing of what we really are, which is awareness itself versus what we're not, all the thoughts and all the forms that seem so important. It like untangles us not because we're trying to go get untangled but because we are choosing to focus better back to what we really are, that silence, that spacious awareness, that aliveness, that thriving living beingness that's always there. That's beautiful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then the other thing I was going to just mention real quick is intuition. So you know, I try not to give too specific of answers because people are so unique, but guess what? Everybody has that knowing. Like everybody's intuition is whispering to them who they really are. So I thank you, Ary, for commenting that practically speaking, I yeah, I recognize this. It's difficult because typically when someone's asking, it's helpful if they have something practical. So it's difficult to comment there, but meanwhile, just I'm just pointing towards listen to your intuition. Like listen to the deeper you. Maybe the deeper you is going to say go take a nap. That's okay. And then the ego will say, "No, I have things I have to function. I have to perform." It's okay if you need to sleep. Go sleep. Like whatever it is, I'm just saying like the intuitive part of you knows. Like the big you is really wise. It has a really good vantage point.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So when we're trying to figure out how to get back to the bliss of being, the big you kind of knows, and if you're willing and humble enough because you got to be like I mean because you know you got to be willing to see your own stuff, but if you're willing to actually listen, intuition will always guide us in that direction when we're willing to actually listen.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you so much again. I just love how each of you are sharing a unique perspective that's just kind of building on what the other is saying, and I just love that for myself because I was born with a pre-birth memory. My entire life was about how do I experience this bliss again, and I spent a lot of years trying to seek that experience and trying to figure it out. I did some crazy things, and I never even got close until in my adulthood, in my late 20s, early 30s, I began to understand that I was looking in the wrong place. I was looking outside of me, trying to stimulate something by going to a church service or out in nature, out in some crazy way, whether like if I get myself in the right place at the right time, something's going to happen.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I finally began to understand that, as Christian said, what I'm looking for is what I already am, and I have to look within. And to echo what Ary said though, a lot of people like, "What does that mean practically?" And that's what I also didn't understand for quite a while. And the way that I explain it now is to say that you have to look in the right place and the right time. The right place and the right time is look here, look now, and look within you. And once you can really grasp that and come fully into the present moment right here and experience your own being, that's where you begin to access this bliss.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Practically speaking, things that have worked for me because for me it has been I've needed practices to help me identify like where am I looking, how do I access this, what does it feel like. One of the biggest things for me has been gratitude because it connects me with my true nature. It connects me with that part of me that is seeing God everywhere in everything. Another thing for me has been putting myself in situations where I'm forced to let go of control and just becoming very present. For instance, riding on a roller coaster or going down a scary water slide with my kids forces me into that present moment experience. Then I can identify and say, "Okay, this is the feeling I'm looking for."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another thing for me is walking barefoot on the earth and meditating because the energy of the earth amplifies my own energy and connects me to myself. And another less pleasant thing that helps me is when I'm in really stressful situations in life to intentionally in those situations set out time to meditate and practice surrender. And when I'm under stress, if I can use that letting go muscle and experience what does that feel like to just let go of things I can't control and be at peace now, I found that probably to be the most amplifying practice for me.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now I haven't ever experienced bliss to the level that I did in my out-of-body experiences here, but little by little, I can start to access these timeless states of being and bring that through a little bit.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Thank you, Melissa, for saying that. I feel like if there's a moment when that bliss might arise, it's like one drop, but the one drop is so wonderful because it's like we're in a desert right now. The one drop is like, "Oh my gosh, I remember that," and we're looking for the ocean. We're looking for the full thing, but even the one drop is so full. So anyway, I thank you for making that comment.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And also the surrendering of the resistance comment, I think that's really powerful because we all have stress. Like we all experience stressful moments. Being fully present in your body even like when you're having those stressful moments, just take time. Like I had a very stressful work meeting this week where I had 11 minutes for lunch in the middle of a six-hour meeting where I was being yelled at for like hours. It's okay. So I stepped out, I sat on this bench, and I just felt this incredible density in my body of like, "Oh wow, I feel that," and just totally allowing it, letting go, totally surrendering to the density, releasing any like, "I don't have power. It's fine. I don't need power over this. I just feel it." You know, that and then when you do that, I'm reminded of an Eckhart Tolle quote. I don't remember the exact quote, but it's something like if you surrender into the present moment for like even the duration of one breath, the movement in consciousness because linear time is transcendent anyway, so even if you just totally let go for the duration of one breath and are fully present, it's okay that it's only the short linear time duration because you're tapping into something that amount of time.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I think that we're doing fine on time. Do you guys want to go ahead with a bonus question?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Melissa: Sure.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Witnessing&nbsp;Souls in Misery" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Witnessing&nbsp;Souls_in_Misery"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Witnessing&nbsp;Souls in Misery</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the experience&nbsp;of witnessing souls in a&nbsp;state of misery&nbsp;and their eventual progression&nbsp;to higher levels is discussed." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_experience&nbsp;of_witnessing_souls_in_a&nbsp;state_of_misery&nbsp;and_their_eventual_progression&nbsp;to_higher_levels_is_discussed."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the experience&nbsp;of witnessing souls in a&nbsp;state of misery&nbsp;and their eventual progression&nbsp;to higher levels is discussed.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All right, bonus question: What is the most significant moment of your pre-birth experience, something that has stuck with you throughout your life?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Aaron: I'm glad we got to this because I had something to share about this. You know, something that really stands out for my experience was kind of two things that are linked together. One is that at one point during my experience, I got to witness some souls that were in a state of extreme misery. You know, they were very unhappy. I think we would kind of call it a hellish existence. And you know, I saw that for myself, and so have many other experiencers. And I think that you can't just ignore that because it's kind of inconvenient or uncomfortable that there are souls that are very unhappy.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But the takeaway I want to share about that is that I witnessed souls leave that form of existence. Like nobody was trapped there forever. I was even told that all of these souls, every one of them, would eventually leave and move to something higher. And that kind of rolls into the second big takeaway I had, which was you know, there's a bit of a commonly accepted narrative that I think is imperfect where souls either go to heaven or they go to hell. But what I witnessed and a lot of other people have talked about is that that's not quite right. Really, it's a huge range of what I would call different levels that souls go to, and that every soul is progressing ever upward to a higher, happier level.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that includes these unfortunate souls that were in a difficult place, but it also includes everyone else that you know, whatever level they're at after this life, none of nobody is stuck there. And that just because you're in a happy place doesn't mean everybody's at the same level of happiness. And if we could shift the viewpoint from black or white, one way or the other way, into more of a graduated or a bunch of different levels, I think we'd have a better understanding of how this is really working. And then the other big thing is hey, nobody's stuck. Nobody is trapped forever after this one life or after a life at whatever level they're at. But they'll be given opportunities to continue their upward progression and improve their happiness and their wisdom and raise themselves to higher levels of existence. So that was my takeaway I wanted to share.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Love as the Answer" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Love_as_the_Answer"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Love as the Answer</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the remembrance of love as the answer to everything is discussed, highlighting the challenges of loving in the density of human experience." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_remembrance_of_love_as_the_answer_to_everything_is_discussed,_highlighting_the_challenges_of_loving_in_the_density_of_human_experience."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the remembrance of love as the answer to everything is discussed, highlighting the challenges of loving in the density of human experience.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Melissa: Thank you so much for sharing that, Aaron. I love that unique aspect of your experience where you saw several different realms and got to see people progress out of them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I guess I will go ahead and share that the thing that's stuck with me most from my pre-birth memory, aside from the bliss of course, it's just the very simple and maybe obvious fact that love is the answer to everything. I remember as a young child just really struggling with understanding not only the violence and the pain that we can inflict on each other here but also something that I couldn't put language to until much later, which is just the lack of awareness that we have here compared to over there. And that's just part of the experience here because we're limited beings, but I just always had like this deeper understanding or remembrance that love is the answer.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now as I've gone about my life, I mean on the other side, it seems so simple, but as I've gone about my life, it's definitely more complicated, a lot more complicated than I thought it was going to be to love in the density that we find ourselves here. It's so difficult because you can do your best and have your best intentions, but because we are limited beings, we are still unintentionally hurting people. I can be doing my absolute best effort, and I forget to call my grandpa on his birthday, or you know, I forget something that my husband asked me to do, or you know, it could be anything like it's impossible to get it exactly perfect.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So what does it mean to love? What does it mean that love is the answer? I think that it also means extending love to ourselves, extending love to our own imperfections and limitations and accepting it all as okay, accepting it all as it is. And that's I think that's something that we tend here not to understand or to forget is that love means immersing yourself in the experience and accepting the experience and holding space for the experience, and that's what will ultimately allow us to progress.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Self-compassion was a big missing component and part of my healing journey that when I was working with my pain coach and colleague this year, I realized it was a big puzzle piece. And especially as if the cultural thing as women and self-compassion and towards our bodies and you know all of that and you know expectations and all of that, it was just a skill that I don't think I was ever taught you know growing up and everything and especially within religion. You're kind of well certain religions I would say especially the one that I was raised in, it was like you saw yourself as a sinner and imperfect and unclean and all of that. And so going from that and then learning self-compassion and love for yourself, that is huge.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I have no idea what that looked like, what it felt like. You know, what does that look like for me? What does it feel like for me? And it's and you know it felt so foreign too like when I started to do it you know it just felt so awkward and then you know one small step and I built upon it and built upon it and soon it was just like it started to feel a little bit like I can do this you know I can learn how to be self-compassionate with myself. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it's so crazy too because it's like I have it for others no problem right for your friend or whatever you're there but for yourself when you're you feel like you're such a harsh critic or a judge on yourself and how you're doing and success and blah blah blah and you know as a parent as a mother as you know there's just so many ways you can judge yourself.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so yeah it's definitely been a step that I couldn't skip I had to learn because I didn't have really anybody to teach me about it. And yeah it's just really it's almost like I wish I kind of that's where I needed to start you know it's interesting how you start with other people but that's like in here you know is where you need to start first.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Being Present and Creative" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Being_Present_and_Creative"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Being Present and Creative</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the importance of being present and in the creative flow is discussed, emphasizing that it helps alleviate symptoms and reminds one of their true nature." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_importance_of_being_present_and_in_the_creative_flow_is_discussed,_emphasizing_that_it_helps_alleviate_symptoms_and_reminds_one_of_their_true_nature."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the importance of being present and in the creative flow is discussed, emphasizing that it helps alleviate symptoms and reminds one of their true nature.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Rebecca: I wanted to say, back to the healing and being in the flow and a lot of managing symptoms and things like that, Ary had brought up being in that creative flow. You know, it's like, "Oh, that's what I do. That's where I go." It helps alleviate those symptoms. Being present, like Christian has beautifully stated throughout this whole interview or podcast or whatever you want to call it, he really gets the root of it. It always reminds you, "Oh yes, that's where it is. It's being present and just feeling like you are already that." So beautifully said, you guys. I really appreciated that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then I wanted to also say, with the pre-birth thing, the most part, like that I remember, is just—and Melissa, you have this as part of yours too—as being that little curious orb, feeling of being that childlike innocence. You know, it's so fun that you get to feel that you have that part of yourself. Then you're fearless. You're curious, and you're fearless. That's another root part of being that I never want to forget.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then, during the pre-birth experience, I got to witness the veil and what that felt like. I also got to witness spreading my energy into the energy body, right? How weird that felt and trying to get into all the nooks and crannies of my energy body until it was satisfied. Then I could go down and be into my Earth incarnation. That was such a good part to witness of the whole experience. Wow, this is what you go through before you come down, and this is how you feel as a soul, as a consciousness. I don't know. I'm just going back and forth again, but I just cannot let go of that feeling of innocent, childlike curiousness. You could do no wrong. I love that so much.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ary or Christian, do you have anything you want to share?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Welcomed and Loved" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Welcomed_and_Loved"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Welcomed and Loved</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the message of being welcomed, loved, and supported in all experiences is discussed, emphasizing the importance of remembering this in times of loss and difficulty." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_message_of_being_welcomed,_loved,_and_supported_in_all_experiences_is_discussed,_emphasizing_the_importance_of_remembering_this_in_times_of_loss_and_difficulty."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the message of being welcomed, loved, and supported in all experiences is discussed, emphasizing the importance of remembering this in times of loss and difficulty.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ary: Thank you for the question. My pre-birth memory was, Lord, and the main message of my pre-birth memory was for me to remember that I'm welcomed wherever I go. I'm loved by everybody, and I'm protected and supported in every way and every time and always. What it helped me with is I lost my family pretty early, so my entire life, I thought I needed a family to be whole, to feel loved, and to belong, to be a person, an individual, my blood family.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I started to learn to love other people the way I would like to be loved and welcomed, accepted without judgment, with clarity. I've noticed that I am truly and incredibly blessed to be loved by everybody in my life. Even every stranger I meet, I feel like family. So instead of a family, the blood family I've lost, I've gained the giant family of the entire planet of people. I truly always question and am grateful for how much I'm loved and how much I'm supported by people on Earth.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that was the message that helped me as a child to remember that, okay, maybe I'll be loved one day if I keep on loving myself. I will show love to other people. That had kept me strong, I would say.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: And this was one of the things I learned in one of my out-of-body experiences. The whole journey, Melissa, which Melissa had said that love is the answer. You know what? It's so crazy because we are love, and everything because we come here and we experience pain and hurt and anger and those things. We experience them because we have—we are love, and we are able to experience them because it's filtered through life, Earthly sensations, and Earthly experiences.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The way to go back to being love is just, I mean, healing those negative, whatever you call emotions, by loving it and giving compassion. So that's the answer. Love is the beginning, and love is the end. It is actually everything. So everything in between is just happening on Earth—only the negative and everything, the pain, and the anger, and frustrations, and things like that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I would say one thing that my memories and out-of-body experiences have taught me is how much we complicate life. It is actually pretty simple if you look at it with curiosity, as Rebecca said. If you are enjoying life, and by enjoying, I mean being in joy with everything that comes, and just being curious about it, it helps to see that it's actually quite simple and quite fun to be here. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I would say that you are loved no matter what, not only by your ancestors, spirit guides, and the source but by everybody around you. If people give you pain because they love you, it's because they chose a contract where they wanted to give you pain. To do that, to choose a contract where they give you a painful lesson, is actually a very hard choice too. It's done by someone who loves you so much. That's what I learned, and that kept me going.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Melissa: Thank you for the reminder Ary it's beautiful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: Yeah, so to your question Melissa, the most powerful moment of my pre-birth experience was after I had accepted the veil and incarnated. I was like, "I'm not doing this, this is not happening." So, I rejected the life. I tried to fight my way back out. In this lifetime, I had done that in a previous life and caused a miscarriage. I had a life review for the previous life because I had caused a miscarriage for the body that was to be mine by my rejection. I tried to do that again in this life because of the fear that rose up. I was like, "Not myself anymore. I was not the whole anymore." I was like, "It was so dense, and I was like, no, not doing this."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But this powerful moment happened where I was—this is so beyond language, oh my gosh—like, it's such a personal experience. I've shared it many times now because I think it's so important for people to know who we are because it's not specific to me. It's like what we are. I was expanded back out, and I was shown all the universe. I felt everything within me—all the stars, all the universe, and beyond our universe. Our universe is just like a small piece of the whole, but all the universe. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I felt the sun of Earth churning and alive within me, and it had so much bliss. It was just so full of raging bliss. I don't know how to describe it. I was like, "Oh my gosh, like I am that. I am still that." So, I don't need to fight anymore. God said to me that this is still what you are. You can never not be this, and it's true of all of us. I just—it moves me to tears almost every time I think of it because it's like I miss it so freaking much.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We're very brave to come down here and play this game. We are much more than the limitations that we've come to reject out of fear. So, that's the most powerful moment of my pre-birth experience. The thing that's in mind the most often, I would say actually, is the veil itself. Except like feeling the veil, accepting the veil. I can feel it right now, like a one-way pane of glass. You know, in those cop shows where you can see one way and you can't see the other. I'm inside the interrogation room where you can't see out, and I know they're there watching. I can see the glass, but I can't see through it. I feel that glass, that metaphorical veil, resting on me and in me right now.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that aspect of that veiling and knowing the veil but not rejecting it. Not responding like, "Oh, this is a problem that I can't see all that I am anymore." No, it's a huge offering to me, for me, for all of us. This offering of being given the opportunity to experience this. Look at where we are, guys. Like, we made it. When we first got on today, and I said, "We made it," that's what I mean. Look at this. It's magic. If we can come all the way here and share love with each other and be vulnerable and remind others.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ary, I love what you said about the whole world being your family. I feel like that. It's a blessing and a curse sometimes, feeling like I love every person that walks down the street, but I do. We are all family with each other. We are, man, and so many humans have forgotten it, but that's what we are. That's our true nature. So, thank you all for coming to this moment and sharing and being brave enough to keep some of that. It is not easy to retain a little bit of that down here.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't mean down, you know, but in this place, in this vibrational density. It can be difficult to have some of that awareness because holy cow, the contrast between that bliss and here. Like you said, Melissa, it's like you spend your whole life looking for it again. I've met so many near-death experiencers who are just like, "I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go home." It's nothing wrong, you know. They just—they're like, "What am I doing here?" So, that's like the cost. That's the price to have that little bit of active awareness. You're going to go put your mail in your mailbox today and go to the bathroom and go buy laundry detergent. That's what we're going to do right now, and that's what we're doing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But see, that's holy too because now we get to do that anyway. I so thank you guys very much. I feel rejuvenated. I had a heck of a week myself. It was like probably the most stressful work week I've had in years, and it's so good to be reminded of who we are, to be there for each other. Thank you.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Melissa: Yes, thank each of you for being a part of this. This is literally like I said, this is my favorite thing that I do, doing these fireside chats and getting a bunch of us together and just sharing. And this has been so encouraging and uplifting for me as well. Is there anything else that anyone wants to share before I give everyone a chance to share where the viewers can find you?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ary: I just want to say thank you for organizing this really so it's so lovely to see you again and Christian I already feel like we've I I don't know we've lived together or I've known each other for many lifetimes and it's really nice to meet you Rebecca and Aaron and it was really lovely to hear your perspectives and your stories I truly feel grateful I'm super happy that's all I want to say thanks for what you do and thanks for being you and thanks for not being afraid of sharing your vulnerability I truly believe that vulnerability is authenticity and that's what makes you unique but thanks for that that also teaches me to be more unique and more open thank you.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: I'll reiterate that Melissa you are so powerful in that way and I really appreciate it I think many other people do as well.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Melissa: Thank you so much and the same to each one of you for being willing to put yourselves out there it's not easy it's not easy to put yourself out there for criticism yeah fine but each of your stories is so powerful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All right well Rebecca do you want to start and share where people can find you anything you have going on that you'd like people to know about?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Rebecca: Thank you Melissa I just wanted to say it's been such a pleasure and you've been such an example to me you know and I think I'm I'm starting to move in that direction where I want to support people who have like either a faith transition or a spiritual awakening or something like

It also mentions his professional background and his book.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian Sundberg has a really unique story. He remembers his life pre-birth, his in-between lives, and how he chose to come here and choose the family he was part of and the person and life he was going to live. When Christian was a young child, he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While he forgot that for most of his adult life, it spontaneously returned 13 years ago when he took up a meditation practice. He also began to have out-of-body experiences. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Professionally, he has a really normal job. He's worked for 16 years as a project manager for complex nuclear pump manufacturing projects and also for an insurance company. Christian is the author of the book <em>A Walk in the Physical</em>, which attempts to describe the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey. I met Christian at the IONS conference (International Association for Near-Death Studies). This is a really unique episode with a really unique story.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Hey everyone, I'm really excited to let you know about the Science and Spirituality Salon I'm now hosting. During these intimate events, a scientifically verified psychic medium will give all of you readings, and I will give a talk on the science and evidence that changed my mind about an afterlife. This will also be an amazing opportunity to get to meet some of you in person or virtually and to share more about all the science and data that transformed my worldview and got me through my worst days.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">These can be hosted in your home, in a nearby cafe with a private room, or they can even be virtual. I've hosted a few already, and they were really special, fascinating, emotional, and evidential. So if you're interested in getting a small group together over dinner, brunch, drinks, or coffee to learn more about the science and to get evidential medium readings, send me an email at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:hello@WTFhappen.net" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="mailto:hello@WTFhappen.net" target="_blank">hello@WTFhappen.net</a> and put "Science and Spirituality" in the title.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Welcome to <em>What the F Just Happened</em>. I'm your host, Liz Enton. If you listened to the intro, you know my story. If not, here's a brief summary: I'm a sciency skeptic, and when my dad died, I took a shot in the dark and decided to investigate if there was any possible evidence of an afterlife. I assumed that was as realistic as Santa Claus, but I was desperate. However, I was so blown away by what I discovered that I wrote a book and launched this podcast. In this podcast, I'll be talking to some fairly normal people about some really weird stuff. I speak with everyone from psychic mediums and afterlife researchers to ordinary people who've had some inexplicable experiences. So come listen. There's no need to draw any final conclusions. Keep an open mind and wonder, "What the F just happened?"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Hi, I am speaking now with Christian Sundberg. He is an author, and we met at the IONS conference. He has a really unique story, and I have honestly never heard it before from anyone else, so I am so happy to have him on. So, Christian, introduce yourself, tell us the name of your book, and why a touch about what happened.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, thank you. Thanks for having me on the show. It was wonderful to meet you in DC. My whole family enjoyed it very much. So, in the human context, my name is Christian Sundberg. My body is 43 years old right now. I've worked professionally in the nuclear field for 16 years and now in insurance as a project manager. But I've had some really impactful personal spiritual experiences, non-physical experiences, including pre-birth memory returning to me. I remember choosing this incarnation and why. So, I didn't share that for about eight years. That memory returned around the age of 30.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I didn't share it because it's just the kind of thing you don't talk about, but I did end up publishing a book, not primarily about the experience but more about what the human experience is, what are we doing here on Earth. The book is called <em>A Walk in the Physical</em> because we are just here having a walk, having a journey and experience. The book was spirit-led. I felt chunks of it come to me intuitively over a period of about six years. I never once sat down and said, "Okay, I'm going to write a book now." That was never how it worked. It was just like intuitive guidance and guidance and guidance, and I was like, "I just got to get this down." Even the way it's organized was very spirit-led.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's available for free on my website. It's not about money. I just want to share the message of what we really are, who we are here on Earth. I'm very, very passionate about that because our true nature is one of joy and freedom and love, and there's nothing to fear. We just really need to remind each other of that while we're here so deep in the play. I think we do have a lot of fear here, especially around death. The more evidence we can get that it's not the end, especially for left-brainers like me, that's so helpful.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Exploring Pre-Birth Memories**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Exploring_Pre-Birth_Memories**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Exploring Pre-Birth Memories</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the discussion delves into Christian's memories of his pre-birth and between-lives experiences, clarifying that this is not his first human life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_discussion_delves_into_Christian's_memories_of_his_pre-birth_and_between-lives_experiences,_clarifying_that_this_is_not_his_first_human_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the discussion delves into Christian's memories of his pre-birth and between-lives experiences, clarifying that this is not his first human life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I want to ask you first of all, there's so much to get into about this, but what led to this memory coming up in the first place of your before this life and between lives? Because I know we'll go into this further, but just to clarify, this is not your first human life, correct?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Correct. Yeah, so okay, that's a great question. So, up until the age of 30, I had no memory of this at all. When I was a very small child, I had some of this pre-birth memory, but it quickly left me by the age of like five or six. So, between the ages of five or six and 30, I had no memory of this at all. I saw the world through a very Lutheran Christian lens, but I was always a seeker. I came across the work of the physicist Tom Campbell. He's a consciousness explorer and has had many out-of-body experiences. I began to—can I just ask, is he the one who's the author of <em>My Big TOE</em>?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, <em>My Big TOE</em>, my big theory of everything. That's right.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, yes, okay. I love him as well. Okay, sorry, make sure it's the same Tom Campbell. Go on.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He encourages you to take up a meditation practice and to just very objectively go see what you are beneath thoughts, beneath thinking. So, at first, I just began and continued the meditation because it felt good. It felt relieving to have some relief from thinking. But after a few months, I had my first non-physical experience, and it was so eye-opening and shocking that I was like, "Oh my gosh, I just need to keep going down this path." So, I continued to meditate, and at some point, I'm not sure exactly when, but within the first year, probably a few months after that, the pre-birth memory was just there. It was the most normal thing in the world. It was like somebody had just blown leaves off of the ground, and there was the grass. It was like even more normal than the human experience that I was having. It was just much more personal and close to me than the human experience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, yeah, it sounds like this great revelation, and sure, the content is very rich and deep and personal, but not strange, very natural. So, you said before this memory came up of your pre-birth experiences, you had a non-physical experience that you thought was shocking. What was that? What happened?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so in brief, I was having a dream, a normal dream, and then in this dream, this wave was going to come over and crush me. I told myself, "Okay, you're going to die now. Let go of the body." But then I woke up, even though my body didn't wake up. I woke up in this state of incredibly strong vibrations and sounds. It sounded like someone had parked a jet engine on either side of my head, and it was so freaking loud. It was louder than anything I'd ever heard on Earth. The vibrations were so strong; it felt like I was being shaken, like I was strapped to an engine. It was just so strong, and I was stuck there for maybe 15 or 20 long seconds, terrified. Then, when it finally ended, I jumped out of bed, sweating, and I was freaked out. I was like, "What the heck was that?" It was not subtle. It was scary, intense, but it was just like the first taste. It was like I had begun to touch other layers of being, other reality data streams, as Tom Campbell would put it. That can be experienced like strong static at first. But anyway, at the time, I didn't understand. I just knew, "Oh my gosh, that was really real. I have to keep going and investigating." So, I just kept going down the path, and since then, I've had a number of out-of-body experiences. It's very, very real, even more real than this Earth, very normal too.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's so interesting you talk about the vibrations and the sounds because there's so much consistency in that. First of all, the vibrations—I've had people who've had NDEs talk about that. Their episodes will be out at some point, and people have talked about that. A lot of meditators, and I had an experience—if you read my book, you know I had this weird experience just early starting this where I felt all these waves, and then that sound you talked about, that's similar to what a lot of people hear when they have out-of-body experiences right before they go out of body, correct? Am I right in that?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's very common actually. I didn't know it at the time. It just scared the crap out of me at the time.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, it scared you. You didn't love it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, I didn't love it at that first moment. It didn't matter. My curiosity was greater than any fear it might have provoked because it was so real. So, I didn't keep meditating in order to have more experiences. That's not really how it worked for me. I just realized that by deeply coming to know what I really am, my consciousness itself, there were larger parts of me that just naturally would arrive. That's just the easiest way I can put it.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Normality of Spiritual Experiences**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Normality_of_Spiritual_Experiences**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Normality of Spiritual Experiences</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the conversation explores how Christian perceives his spiritual experiences as normal, despite their extraordinary nature." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_conversation_explores_how_Christian_perceives_his_spiritual_experiences_as_normal,_despite_their_extraordinary_nature."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the conversation explores how Christian perceives his spiritual experiences as normal, despite their extraordinary nature.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm going to ask you, and then I'm going to ask you about your experience of your pre-birth, in-between lives memory, but first, I'm going to ask you—you kept saying all this was actually really normal. What do you mean by that? Because if people hearing this for the first time might not say it's normal. I know it doesn't sound normal. I'm a normal guy, I promise, though I know it sounds really strange. What I mean is that—oh, this is difficult to speak to, and I want to just disclaim before we get into these topics that language is just incredibly insufficient. There's just no way to use earthly language to speak to our higher natures or for the higher realms from which we come because our language is based in our local world. It's based in form and symbol and all the assumptions of Earth that we just take for granted, like linear time, the discreet location. We really believe in those things. Our language is based on them and in them, but our higher nature precedes all of that context. So, it's almost impossible to speak about these things using language.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that being said, I can at least say that as we very simply—but not simply—but it's more difficult than it might seem on the human level, underneath all the levels of what we're not, underneath all the human story, our consciousness itself is already something. You could say that the you that feels like you to you is the most natural thing for you, and then that you has become wrapped up within the story of form, the story of the human condition, the human life. That's not really what you are. It's actually just kind of like a big virtual reality that you're deeply, deeply engaged in. So, that's what I mean like it's more normal because when you actually let go of all that, you're not letting go of the thinking, letting go of the judgments and the conditioning and the story, and you just dwell fully in the aliveness that you are, then what arises within that is very natural, very normal. And it can actually be seen that the experience of being separate, apparently separate, which is what the human experience is like—we experience separation rather deeply here, extremely deeply here. That's like the name of the game is to feel separate from each other. That is the actually the alien state of being by comparison.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm going to have more questions about that after, but first, what happened when you remembered this between lives experience? Or actually, you remembered before your very first life on Earth, am I correct? And then you also remember between lives. So, what did you remember? I guess we'll start linearly, even though apparently linear time isn't real, but we'll start with your first memory pre-birth life as a human.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I've shared this a number of times, so I won't go into the full detail. It's a story that I've shared on a number of podcasts, but I'll just say that before I had ever incarnated, I came across a being who had incarnated. Okay, so this is like really difficult to speak to because then people want to know, "Okay, where were you? What was the environment? What did everything look like?" I'm happy to try to speak to some of that, but I'll just at least summarize very simply and say that I was in a different reality system at the time that looked like an environment of living light. I was and am that light too, and so is everybody else. I'm connecting with them, and when you engage with another being in that context, it's like a telepathic exchange. It's not words because separation is not a thing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I could feel from this being the intense quality of his nature. He was full of so much power and joy and peace and freedom, and his evolution was just off the charts. I don't know how to describe this, and I was just very, very deeply inspired by who he was, what he was. I asked him, "How did you do this? How are you this?" And I asked, "Do you feel as much freedom and power as I feel that you feel?" And he shared, "Yes," and he allowed me to feel through and into him. And I asked, "How did you do that?" And one of the things he showed me was that he had lived a physical life where he had suffered a long-term health condition. He had suffered pain and ailment, and the way that he chose to meet that experience, process that experience, the way that his spirit met it and utilized it, allowed this incredible refinement of his being. And I was like, "Oh my gosh, I want to do that. I want to do that. I'm going to do that." And at first, he communicated something like, "Yeah, that's what they all say," not in a negative way, but kind of like, "You just don't understand how hard this can be." And I was like, "No, I mean it. I want to do it."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that was before I was ever had a physical incarnation, and since then, I've had many experiences. I ended up finding this being later and sharing with him that I was on the path. So, I don't know if that speaks to your initial question, but that's just a quick summary.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, I have some more from it. So, when you ran into this being again, did you ever run into him on Earth?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I have no idea. I'm still like super veiled. I'm still a veiled being right now while I'm in the human condition. So, I mean, it's possible, but keep in mind, I don't want to get too far out in the woo weeds here, but keep in mind that Earth is not the only incarnation opportunity. So, you know, I know that he was physical, but it's a very big universe, and there's more than one universe even. It's a very huge multi-dimensional context. So, I have no idea if I've ever encountered the being here on Earth. I don't know. I mean, it makes sense. There's plenty of other planets. Even NASA, traditional science, is finding other Goldilocks planets, and we already know this galaxy, let alone the whole universe, is filled with them. And you said multiverse—you think there's other universes?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, I do.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, everyone isn't completely lost. What do you mean by veiled?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so what I mean by veiled—this is a really important concept. Your consciousness precedes the human experience. So, that consciousness, its native state, is to be connected to all things and to know that connection and feel that connection all the time. So, if you imagine an ocean of water, you're like a drop in the ocean. So, your native state is to be one with the ocean, and you're still you. You're still a drop. You're individuated, but you're also one with the ocean, and that oneness is known and felt. What I mean is, in this state, you have access to all knowing, all data. You're capable of so much more than what we perceive here on Earth. So, in order to have the very specific and limited and dense experience of being human, you have to accept what we call very simply the veil, which just means a set of constraints in consciousness space that go along with having the incarnation experience.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Veil of Forgetfulness**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Veil_of_Forgetfulness**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Veil of Forgetfulness</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian discusses the experience of the veil of forgetfulness being placed on him and the significance of this event." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_discusses_the_experience_of_the_veil_of_forgetfulness_being_placed_on_him_and_the_significance_of_this_event."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian discusses the experience of the veil of forgetfulness being placed on him and the significance of this event.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Do you remember the experience of how that veil was put on you? Is that something you're okay to share?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so accepting the veil was like surrendering to a plummet in vibration. This is really hard to describe, but imagine your body—but not your physical body—your body of awareness, the body that feels like your physical body, but it's really your consciousness connected to everything and existing in an extremely high vibration state. And then having a cloak of veil put upon you that you surrender to, surrender into, and accept. And then through doing that, there's this plummet and vibration down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, more lower, more lower, all the way down into this extremely dense state of being. And in that process, all knowing is erased, cut off—not actually erased, but you feel like it's erased. All of your connectedness, all of your remembrance, all that active knowing is veiled, is cut off. And that is precisely the value of the physical experiences that we come into. We have that experience of being just the human from the limited point of view with no memory, no memory of anything else.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, when does this veil go on? Is this when you're a baby or so?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so we're never actually a baby. I know that sounds okay, so the physical—think of the physical like a simulation that's running on its own, and then we interject into it and assume the role of a given perspective, a given body. So, in my case, I accepted the veil before this body was born, so while it was still in the womb of my mother. So, surrendering to the veil occurred, and then there was this plummet, and then I was in the womb. And then I almost rejected the experience actually because I was like, "I am not doing this. This vibration is so low. I'm not doing this." But I ended up sticking with it because the spirit came to me and encouraged me, showed me again who I really am. So, that occurred. I don't know when in the pregnancy, but I can at least say that after that happened, it felt like I was in the womb for a long time before a physical birth actually happened. And then I do remember—I have some short, brief, shocking memories of the day I was born physically in this life.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Right, and I know some of those memories were verified, but first, which you have to explain, but first, I do want to ask you—you said the veil blocks all memories, but it didn't for you, and it doesn't in some of the cases that, say, Dr. Jim Tucker has researched on cases of kids with past life memories and some in-between lives memories. So, why does it not?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so I'm not special first of all. So, I remember though, in my pre-birth experience, asking, "Can I have like a tiny bit of memory this time? I don't want to forget everything. I want to just have a little tiny bit of memory." And they said, "I, the guides, said I could do that." But I knew that that would make this life more challenging, more difficult because then the contrast is even greater. If there's any recollection of home, there's like this homesickness that gets introduced that's extreme, very extreme.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so the veil is very effective. It's super effective. It works, but on the other hand, the short answer to your question is the soul—each one of our souls is so huge and vast and complex and powerful. I mean, basically, to put it very in crude terms, you are a piece of God. Okay, so what can truly veil God? Well, only God's surrendering God's self can veil God. That's why we have to surrender ourselves into the veil. There's no way for you to be veiled any other way. Even though we surrender ourselves, we are still on the other side right now. So, it's not that there's like unfairness or something. It's more like each soul is so unique, and each veil is unique and organic and specific to that soul. Each life is unique, each body is unique, each context is unique, the history of every soul is unique. So, with all that uniqueness and all that richness, it's natural that some are there's going to be some breaks in the simulation. The veracity is maintained as best as possible, but you're going to have, especially as we awaken, which means especially as we increase the vibration of our consciousness towards what we really are, that it would become more and more because the vibrational distance is decreasing slowly. And as that distance decreases, it becomes more readily available to have some snippets of memory or awareness of who we really are.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I don't think they've done this, but I'm so curious, and I wish they would—that you've never had your brain scanned, and people who have more pre-birth memories, there isn't some difference in your brains that have been discovered there?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, you haven't participated in that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, and I'm going to ask a quick question. You use the word God, and I just—I'm curious what you mean by that because the only God I understood was like the biblical one, which is why I just never believed in anything like a god. So, when you say God, I'm assuming you don't mean the single sort of ding consciousness that tells—okay, so it's just a word, and I know that it's a loaded word. I personally don't mind that term, but I recognize it has a lot of baggage too. So, okay, so the word—oh my gosh, it points to something that is so far beyond language. I can't even possibly begin to speak to it. You could say metaphorically God is the source of all that is, the one ocean—ocean with a capital O—the great I Am presence of all things, the one true knower of which you are a part. So, that's not a dude. That's not a dude in the sky. It's being itself but also the most personal, loving wholeness of being. It's like, for each of us, it's like our dearest friend and our most poignant love and our parent. Yeah, it's like the truest relation. It's a relationship that's the closest to all of us actually.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, that's really interesting and probably something we can't fully understand as humans, correct?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Memories of Birth and Life Choices**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Memories_of_Birth_and_Life_Choices**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Memories of Birth and Life Choices</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian shares his memories of his birth and the choices he made regarding his life and family." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_shares_his_memories_of_his_birth_and_the_choices_he_made_regarding_his_life_and_family."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian shares his memories of his birth and the choices he made regarding his life and family.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And you said you had memory of your birth, and it was—I know that you also mentioned that was verified in your book. You mentioned that. I'm also just going to say because you said you've gone into a lot more details other places—Christian's book, he goes into a lot more of these details, so get his book. It's really good. It's also audiobooks. You can listen, you can read it. So, I just wanted to give you a little plug because I love your book. So, of course, but yeah, so tell us about your memory of your birth. The only verification I think that you're mentioning is later in my life, I drew the birth room for my mother, and she verified that that was where the objects in the room were located. Like, I remember where the bed was, where the heating grate was, the window, where the doctor was standing. It's just one image memory, and in this image, I was like up away from the bed. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I know they say babies can't see, so I don't really understand how I've seen this, but I remember seeing it. I remember the color of the paint on the heating grate. So, I mean, so that's, you know, is that formal verification? No, you know, it's subjective. It's close to home. I don't feel a need to prove it, but I've had other forms of verification though with experiential verification. Sometimes, if I have a non-physical experience with someone, I will really do my best when I'm interacting with them non-physically to try to confirm it and prove it that we've interacted that once, you know, we're here once we're doing the physical awake thing. And I've had probably half a dozen successes. I've had at least as many failures where the individual doesn't remember the interaction, but I've had some confirmations that were definitely good enough for me at least. And at least one while I was awake where I mentioned this briefly before we began recording, but I was interacting with a woman who I know that I know non-physically. I've never met her personally, and I had an interaction with her that I was able to confirm at least to my own satisfaction.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And what would you say is the most mind-blowing verified experience you've had that maybe someone who's very skeptical, especially someone who's in a lot of grief or maybe facing their own mortality, they might really love?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, I can at least share the example that I was just mentioning, and I will in a moment, but let me just point out that okay, so I am all for verification. I'm all for skepticism. We need to remain both open-minded but also skeptical and investigate with as much objectivity as possible. The truth stands up to all scrutiny. So, that's good. But I also want to point out, however, that the truest verification is your own personal experience of it. The truest evidence won't be an external like someone showed me a new object or told me a new story. It will be a knowing and experience yourself. Like, when I've been out of body and seen the color of the sky in a certain environment that is more colorful than anything on Earth—with that much lucidity and feeling my connectedness to it, it's so self-evidently real. It's off the charts. Like, it doesn't need you to come back to this comparatively black and white movie on Earth and say, "Oh, is that real?" No, no, no. You know it. You really know it. And that personal knowing, that personal experience, that's the real evidence.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, is one quick comment to that—so I really lift up meditation as a practice, not so that you can have these amazing experiences. No, that's not the goal. Rather, I encourage that you go just very objectively investigate what your own consciousness is beneath thought. So, don't make anything up, no new stories, no new ideas. I know your thinking mind is going to go into overdrive. I want to give you some new ideas, and what are the new ideas I can think about? No, no, just put all that aside and actually go experientially with full alertness. Go investigate every day for 30 or 40 minutes, set every day for months. Don't judge it even for three or four months. Investigate experientially what is my awareness, what is my consciousness beneath thought. And I recommend an exercise in part four of my book to get started with that process if anyone is interested.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so that was a long tangent, but I think that's important because as soon as we talk about verification, we tend to think in our local thinking minds context, "Show me the evidence." Well, I'll at least share this brief story. So, this woman that I had interacted with online, I just sensed intuitively that her and I were like soul family. Like, I just knew her really well. So, I went for a walk at work one day out up a road, and I had this interaction with her higher—I know this sounds crazy, this is getting into the woo field, but this is what happened. I had this interaction with her, and I felt her send this like energy down my back, and it was very healing. And I remember her communicating, "This is a gift," and I said, "Thank you very much." It's really interesting. Wow. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then I remember her nudging, "You see that piece of moss on the ground in front of you? Pick that up, take it back to your desk, and go tell my human—the me, you know, me that's playing the human—that you found this piece of moss in the context of you receiving this energetic gift from me." I'm like, "Okay, this is crazy. Okay, I'll be the crazy guy." So, I took the moss back to my desk at work, messaged this woman on Facebook, and I said, "I explain what happened," and she said, "I kid you not, last night I said to my husband, 'The perfect example of a gift that someone could give me would be a piece of moss.'" So, that kind of thing to me is verification. That's verification to me. Does anybody else have anybody else? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, they didn't see that. It's not on paper. It's not like a thousand scientists can go study that or something. There are many studies out there of similar research, but for me, that's the kind of thing that now it no longer is strange. You know, when I have a verified confirmed interaction, that's not strange at all to me. I've become very familiar with feeling because I'm a very left-brain person too. You know, I'm a project manager of 20 years. I worked in the nuclear industry for 16 years, and that's just how my mind has historically worked. However, the deeper parts of ourselves, the intuitive portions, they actually know a lot more. When you're willing to be humble enough to put aside the intellect and actually go see what's actually down there, through that, I have felt the living connection I've had with others in ways that have been confirmed, and it's really beautiful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm going to just tell a slightly verification-ish story, and I—for me, things get verification when you talk, you hear more and more stories again and again similar to what Christian shared, and you meet people like you, you know, Christian, who are really normal people, and it just happens more and more. And I think the body of evidence comes together to give us so much—I mean, more than just hope. But it was funny, I was watching Christian's talk during the IONS conference, and I was like, "Oh, I completely know him," like without a doubt, just the way you know you see someone you haven't seen in like six years that you worked with or 10 years ago from—I don't know how old anyone is, but you know, 10 years ago or school or whatever, and you're like, "I would see a person forever." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I'm watching him talk, I was like, "Oh yeah, he did this talk for a forever family webinar, and I help on the behind the scenes." So, I was like, "I know Christian." Then I said to him, "We both, you know, I went up and introduced myself and said that I have this podcast, <em>What the F Just Happened</em>, and would like him to come on." And he's like, "Oh yeah, I know you." And I said, "Yeah, you did the webinar for forever family." No, he didn't. So, I was like, "Oh, we, but I like, I know him. I've seen this talk. I've met him at parties, and I saw him on the afterparty one night at the IONS conference." And I said, "Oh, you must know this friend of mine. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Did we do a podcast together with him?" No, I, you know, he had to go. His whole family is there. He has fairly young children. I'm looking through, I think I found your LinkedIn or Facebook or something, but I was like, "Oh, you know what, I've got to figure this out because it was really bothering me, like no doubt I knew him." And he said, "No doubt he knew me." I was like, "Maybe did he used to work in the photography or videographer? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Maybe we knew each other when I used to work in fashion during a fashion week event, and you know, we photo shoot." No logical reason we've ever met each other, and Christian said he absolutely knew me, and I was like, "Okay, this is so weird. What if I like knew him between lives? Let me play with the evidence of this." And I brought that up before we start recording, Christian was like, "Oh yeah, yeah, no." So, that was—I mean, I sensed it before, you know, when you came up to—we were so, um, for the listeners, we went to the IONS party that one night in Washington, DC, met all sorts of amazing people, and you know, you and I got to have a conversation, and I just knew. I was really in the zone, the meditative state, and I was like, "Oh yeah, I definitely know you. I mean, you're like, yeah, from something." I'm like, "No, no, before this, obviously. Like, I mean, to me, it's obvious that there was, you know, there's relationship there." See, but that's how like so many of us—a lot of us have relationships, and we just don't remember it, or we come across each other, and we just feel some connection. It's deeper than that. I don't know what the specifics are. I'm not quick to jump on them. You know, I'm like, I remain skeptical too. It's important to keep that skepticism, but I also know, you know, my intuitive—I know, you know, when I know somebody. And so, yeah, it's not strange to me.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so, um, yeah, so that was very an interesting experience. So, I'm going to actually—I want to know that or see what you have to say about this. What is life like on the other side? Sometimes it sounds like it'd be really boring. Just, oh, you're just in a sea of love. Not that love's not great, but like, it sounds like being at a spa, which is great for three days, but being in a spa for 10 years, I'd want to—I'd be so miserable. So, it sounds very boring. Is there purpose or friendship? Okay, what is it like?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I love this question. Okay, so the question is a little bit like let's say you and I are playing Minecraft together or playing a video game together, and we play Minecraft for years, and then you say to me in Minecraft one day, "Well, what's it like outside of Minecraft? It sounds so boring. There is so much to do on Earth outside of Minecraft. How could you possibly describe that to someone in Minecraft?" Similarly, the limitations that we experience while we're human are off the charts. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They're so high. So, when you take away those limitations, the native nature of spirit, of consciousness, is so creative and so powerful and so free that the possibilities for experience are unfathomably vast, way more than we can even imagine within the human mind. So, the other side is not just one place. It's not like one loading screen, and that's it, and then this is the real place. No, this is actually like the not real place, and there are many, many different reality systems that all have their own rules and their own purposes. And I only have awareness of some, and there's some that I felt guided not to share too much about, which is fine. I just can say at least that there is a multi-dimensional scope that is beyond imagining, and it's not boring.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It may be true that I will say at least though that when we exist in that very free state, there is a certain something that the limitation set of being physical provides that we don't get anywhere else. Like, a certain challenge that seems to be missing. So, you might say, like as a metaphor, let's say you work out every day, and you go to the gym, and you're in great shape, and then you stop working out for a couple of weeks. You just might crave going back to the gym. Now, in this case, it's not like the gym has something to offer that we don't already natively have. You know, we already are everything we need. We don't need anything. We don't need to do anything. Being is already whole. Yet, evolution occurs. Evolution is happening. Evolution meaning the expansion of love and joy. So, we may choose to re-engage this physical experience, or we may choose a great many other experiences.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I can also say very generally speaking that most other reality systems are thought-responsive. So, that is our intention and our thoughts immediately have an effect. That actually happens here on Earth too, but it's a lot slower. It's like ridiculously slow. So, there are a lot of different options, and you, I guess, universes, dimensions with different laws. The way here we have laws—I can't jump a thousand feet in the air. It takes X amount of hours to get from point A to point B. Every space in this reality—yeah, you can't go directly somewhere. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Right, right. And if I want a certain object, somebody has to physically make it. You can't just think it, and it will appear. So, those are the laws. That's right. Yeah, just like video games might have different rules. You know, you can play one video game, and you might play another one, and that has completely different rules, different story, different context, different character. Maybe there's no character. You know, maybe it's Pong. Whatever. There are reality systems of experience that are very different, but they all have their own rules of some kind, and ours just happen to be at the very far end of the high limitation spectrum. So, you can think of our reality at the far end.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Transcending Duality**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Transcending_Duality**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Transcending Duality</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"> Where the discussion explores the concept of transcending duality and the nature of reality and consciousness.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so we transcend all duality. So, I'm not trying to make it sound like duality is fundamentally true or real. It's not, but experientially within the realms of what is duality—duality meaning the experience of this and not that, up and not down, hot and not cold, dark and not light, you know, this shape and not that shape, this is an apple and not a pear. Very meaning that we think here and then the other side, and there's one this up, this experience, and then the other, and those are the only two in all of consciousness. But that's—there's limitless types and states of—I don't know if it's limitless, but it's extremely huge at least. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But yes, right, yes. Um, it is yes. So, we perceive reality from within the lens of duality that we learned. You know, so like we learn discreet location. That's a really big one to us. You're over there; I'm over here. And that's just—and then if I want to go somewhere else, I got to move my body between every intermittent space to get there. That is specific to our reality. Like, it's so obvious to us, and it's so like assumed. So, usually when we ask about the other side, we're like, "Okay, tell me about the places. Tell me about the environments. Tell me about the objects. What does it look like? I want to tell me the visual because I understand that." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And there are those things in higher systems. In fact, they're even more real. The sensory experience is even more rich and real there. However, spirit is not primarily made of form. That any of these shapes or symbols or experiences—spirit transcends all form. Um, and we just engage it and utilize it for the growth of being. It's like a huge play or a game that we utilize form, and this reality just happens to be super, super limiting and super dense. And it's kind of like going into outer space in an astronaut's space suit or going to Mount Everest maybe or something like that. It's extreme.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, are we the most dense, or are there denser or more difficult planets or realms?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so to my experience, this reality, this universe, is the most dense, limiting type of universe. But also, keep in mind that really what ends up becoming dense is the vibration of consciousness itself when it associates into something like the physical universe. It's not okay. It's we veil into a very defined, extreme set of limitations. That's the physical universe. But then when we're here, we apply the meaning. And so, when the meaning that we apply is converse to our true nature, that ends up being an extreme negative, hellish type low vibration experience. Hellish, low vibration type experiences can happen here. They can also happen in thought-responsive reality systems if we're really deep into fear and actualizing fear. Fear is—you could just say fear is hell, whether it's here or in another environment. Whereas our true nature is total love and peace and joy, and there's nothing to fear in it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I went kind of around in a circle there, but yes, this is the most limiting type of experience that I'm aware of. And I was aware of that in my pre-birth experience that this was like, "Wow, off the charts."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And are there other planets and solar systems and galaxies in this reality?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, and they each have their own vibration. You know, they each have their own context. You could say the human collective consciousness has its own color or its own sound or its own temperature. You could say, and so the human collective consciousness is one pond within a much larger ocean. It's a very exciting pond, super, super interesting, super tantalizing opportunity. Wow, get your hands dirty. You know, play in the mud, kindergarten or junior high type experience. You know, that's Earth by comparison to some of the other systems, but very unique, very precious. In fact, being given the opportunity to play a human during the awakening at all—the awakening meaning this period of time we're going through right now—is such an honor. It's like so unique and such a precious opportunity.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And are there humans on other planets?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't think so. I don't know. I would imagine not, but maybe other carbon-based DNA life forms. I don't know. I know there are other intelligent civilizations. I remember knowing that I had lived at least once in a different intelligent civilization in the physical with a very different vibrational experience. I don't know about humans or, you know, I don't know. That sounds strange to my logical brain.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And what about way back in history? I'm talking way, way back, like pre-Big Bang, and then post-Big Crunch. Are there other like—what I mean, let's even break it down. Let's start instead of before—okay, yeah, let's go through different ones first. Let's just start with this solar system. Okay, like, were there other material human or carbon-based complex consciousness in this dimension before this solar system developed?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I don't know when in the 15 billion years of this universe I don't know when whatever given form of life appeared where. I have no access to that kind of information. I do know that life is developed throughout the universe at varying rates. So, that is because the whole universe is like a simulation occurring with spirit within consciousness, and consciousness is synonymous with the word life. Okay, so life is creating and utilizing this context. It's not like the context is first, and then life happens second. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Life happens first, and life utilizes the context and then shines through it in the form of various physical life forms or even forms that we might not consider conscious. Like, for instance, I was aware in my pre-birth experience—as long as we're going in this direction—that the sun itself had a living consciousness. It was like awareness. It's really hard to describe. So, I don't know when, but I, you know, in the context of the 15 billion years, but I can at least say that oh yes, we definitely precede the entire linear time sequence of the physical. It'd be like you asking after we played Minecraft for a few years, "Did we exist before Minecraft?" Uh, yes, yes, there's that's for sure. Just because you turn on a Minecraft server doesn't really affect the larger world that much. You know, it's kind of how it is here where our consciousness does precede the physical universe and its timeline.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Even before the Big Bang, and you think it will continue after the Big Crunch?</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Big Crunch and Consciousness**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Big_Crunch_and_Consciousness**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Big Crunch and Consciousness</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"> Where the conversation touches on the idea of a Big Crunch and the role of consciousness in the universe.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, if there's a Big Crunch, for sure. The whole year time sequence is a creation. It's an illusion. It's created within us. So, certainly, we precede the Big Bang. The Big Bang is just the beginning of the simulation. Someone hits the run button, and then it goes, and you know, now billions of years are unfolding, and that's fine. Do we precede that? Oh, yeah, yeah, we're not physical. We just lose ourselves in the physical experience at given points, and that's valuable. But the spirit certainly precedes the physical. In fact, there are these—it's hard to describe—these waves of creation where the like, like an out-breathing of universe and then an in-breathing, and then like waves within waves. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You could say, and then there's this expansion of being that accompanies each wave, and we utilize that. We participate in that, and we precede that whole process. I say we because I don't want to differentiate you and I, the little characters that we feel like we are, with the whole because as we are individuated as souls, but we are also one with the whole. Like, I said, so this is something that we and the whole are participating in together. It's very difficult to describe. And so, we are the creator. I'm just pointing out that we are creators. We are part of the creative process, not just lost within this loop or something.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, how do animals play into all of this? Do we have the same—could we go be animals? Are animals doing the same thing along with us, and we're all kind of the same type of telepathically communicating souls on the other side? I mean, although I feel like I communicate really well with animals here.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Consciousness has animals, or consciousness has humans. Like, consciousness has human experiences, or consciousness has animal experiences. The differences might be significant in the local sense. You know, an animal has a very different cognitive potential than a human, for instance. But it doesn't matter. Consciousness precedes that limitation set and then uses it and shines through it. And in some ways, like take a dog for instance, you know, they might not be able to think the same way we do, but they're actually way more present in certain ways. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They're always present, just kind of shining with that light of being, and we love that. You know, we thrive on that. They actually serve us just by being with us because they don't have that burden of the cognitive hell that sometimes we wear in the form of all these thoughts that we get associated with that dogs don't have. But yeah, both are consciousness. I have one memory of being a non-human animal. I know that sounds really wild, but I remember being a migrating bird actually, and it was a very spiritual but very physically rigorous experience. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Very physically rigorous but very spiritual feeling. So, it was physically rigorous because life in the wild for animals is tough. Yeah, I don't really know why. I just remember it being really vigorous, and I remember just as an example—I know this is getting out there, but I'm just just for fun—I mean, this is what I remember. The it wasn't intellectual. Like, there was no ideas, you know, no like logical thoughts at all, but there was this knowing. This you could even say like a feeling that if I was separated from my flock, my pack, I would die. Like, it was terrifying to be without the flock. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That would be really, really bad, and then there was this compulsion to stay with that group. I know this sounds wild because from my human point of view, it's really alien reflecting back on that and feeling it is very alien feeling. It doesn't feel like me, the human conditioning that I'm used to that I'm wearing right now. It's very different, but still feels like me. You see, that's the thing. It's still me.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, you said it's still you. Do you think we always stay ourselves when we're on the other side? Can we feel safe our loved ones are still themselves after they pass?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, yeah, yeah. You're you. You're not the human. So, when the human—it's like the question is a little bit—and I mean this playfully—the question is a little bit like saying, "Are you still you when you take off your shirt?" Yeah, of course. In fact, you're less constrained. Stepping out of a body is like that. You're actually more like you. You actually feel more like yourself because now you're not all these limitations that you thought were you, like the age, you know, the health issues, the psychological conditioning that wasn't you. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, you kind of drop all that, and the real you isn't that thought set. It isn't that thought pattern. That was just something you wore, something you saw through. The real you is free and wonderful and alive. And yes, that individuated you is always preserved. It's precious. It's preserved, and that's true of all of our loved ones, even though they may have played other characters too. It's like if you have a high school play, you know, and you play these characters on a stage, and then later you go out for coffee, you don't have to be your character in the coffee shop anymore because you know that you're not that character. But you could really like reflect, reminisce, enjoy your relationship. In fact, you expanded your relationship through the play that you just acted on stage together.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, and you mentioned, you know, as the bird being terrified being separated from your flock because you would die, and we're all really scared of death. It's why are we scared of it if we've done it multiple times, and we are going somewhere where we're so much safer than here? Why do we have this like existential bleakness?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's the main fear, yeah, because we've lost our identity, our ourselves, our sense of selves into an illusion. We've bought into the form. "I am the body. I am the story. I am the linear time. I am the job. I am the thing." And then guess what? Then the body dies. So, now what happens is when we learn that the body dies or we see a body die for someone that we love, what immediately happens so quick is we so quick we don't even catch it is we buy into a perception, "I can be destroyed." That's not true, but as soon as you buy into a perception that's not in alignment with the truth, fear arises mightily, and that great fear of death arises from the great misperception that I can be eradicated, I can be destroyed. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">God can't be destroyed. It's the thing that is. It exists forever. It's the main thing that is. So, but when the main thing that is really buys into a perception that it can stop existing or that it can lose its freedom or that it can be powerless or that all the great negative perceptions we encounter on Earth—on Earth that provokes fear because it's not in alignment with the truth. See, but that's precisely the opportunity of Earth is we really get to come in and actually have the experience of perceiving like, "Wow, I'm going to die now. What do you do with that?" You know, and then when you step past it at the end, you look back, "Oh my gosh, there's never anything to fear," but you had the experience of being in that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm reminded of a Seth quote. I don't remember it exactly. Seth was a guide channeled by Jane Roberts back in the '70s, and Seth said something like, "Every one of my physical lives, I thought I was going to die and be destroyed, and it would be oblivion. Every one of them." And he said something like, "If only one I could have known that truly I lived on, then even death could have been a great adventure." And I wish to share that message with people because I know it's not easy. I know this is super convincing, and we don't remember anything else, but really, there's nothing to fear. There is no death. Death is a big illusion.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I know you made the comparison of a school play, but there's still certain characteristics that you play as a character in a play that don't carry over. So, they're characteristics of ourselves, our loved ones, that we just adore. Like, both my dad and my mentor, who sadly passed also, just had the best sense of humor and were so funny, and I love that about both of them. And I hope that is still aspects of them in the non-physical. Do some of our best qualities and personal traits carry over?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The soul has qualities. This is really difficult to speak to because the soul also transcends all form, but anyway, the soul has qualities, and we each have our own nature. You could say, and that nature is felt and known by each other. Like, in the non-physical, when someone shows up, you don't go, "Oh, hey, so-and-so name." No, you don't need to because you feel their vibration. You feel exactly who they are. Like, that's who they are is their being, their feeling, their vibration. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All the qualities that make them them, those qualities then shine through the human character and through the human limitation here. We do wear non-native limitations. Like, the biology might have limitations. Like, maybe you have a neurochemical issue because your body doesn't process a certain nutrient correctly or something. You know, now you are seeing the universe through a lens of a biology that doesn't work in a certain way. You know, so now you have to do what you can. You have to make choices from within that neurochemical context. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You're not actually the neurochemistry. When the body dies, and the neurochemistry is dropped, you actually feel more like yourself. But your native qualities can still shine through it. And what's really important also is of course our native qualities and who we are affect the body very much. They can help the body heal, or they can guide the body. The body is kind of like a living record, a living soundboard so that we can explore who we really are. And the true qualities of who we are, we absolutely do take with us.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Identity and Purpose**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Identity_and_Purpose**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Identity and Purpose</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the focus is on Christian's identity and the purpose he was meant to fulfill in his life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_focus_is_on_Christian's_identity_and_the_purpose_he_was_meant_to_fulfill_in_his_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the focus is on Christian's identity and the purpose he was meant to fulfill in his life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I want to ask you a little bit about being Christian. What made you decide to be Christian—Christian the human, not Christian the religion.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Right, Christian the—oh yeah, Christian the human, Christian Sundberg. Yeah, I know that sounds crazy. I'm not actually Christian Sundberg. This is just a—there is no Christian Sundberg. I know you're seeing an image and hearing a voice. What I am is my awareness. I am the I. You are the you. You are the knower of your experience. But anyway, so why did I choose to engage this context? In my case, I wanted to process a very old fear that had bested me in a previous experience because I knew that there was a profound opportunity for expansion—the expansion of being and the evolution of consciousness, my consciousness, and all that is through this experience. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, the guides brought me this life as Christian as an opportunity that was a pretty good match for my intention. It actually wasn't as good of a match as a previous life that I had previously—not accidentally, but I had—I don't go too far down this path, but I had aborted this previous incarnation because I was so fearful in the womb. That previous life was actually a much better energetic match to my intention of facing this fear. This life was like pretty good, was good enough. So, that's like the main thing. And so, then when they brought it to me, I reviewed what it would be like to be Christian. You know, like millions and millions of possibilities before I was even incarnated. I reviewed like what it would be like to feel like to be me, to be here this long, you know, this like length of time that would feel so long, and to feel the body, and to feel what it would be like to actually be in certain circumstances that were more or less like depending on all the free will choice making that would unfold from me and from everybody else.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, the person you were supposed to be—was that with different parents?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I would say supposed to be same. That was no, that was just a previous opportunity that did not pan out. That was different parents. I don't know anything about that life. I just know it was more appropriate than this one would have been, but this is still good. It's good enough. Does the job. I'm glad I got to meet you, a cool person. I'm glad Christian Sundberg exists as you.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, interesting. What do you know what number life, at least approximately?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I know that I've lived hundreds of times, but I don't have—I don't know about a number. I once meditated, and afterwards, I saw all these spheres that were my lives, and there were hundreds of them, and I was like, "Oh my gosh, I am all these people." Like, maybe that's a bad way to put it. I have experienced all these things. That's a better way to put it. So, I know that it's in the hundreds, but I have no idea.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, when we cross over, you said there's kind of different dimensions, just like here we could live in a village in Thailand, a big city in China, we could live in a small town in America. I mean, there's just so many completely different physical experiences we could have. Most likely, we can live on other Goldilocks planets. Are there all different communities and styles you could live on?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I can't speak in great depth about it because I'm still quite veiled, but there are for sure other communities that we can engage. I'm reminded of the book <em>Autobiography of a Yogi</em> that my wife and I are reading right now, and in this book, the author, Yogananda, his master comes back to him after death and shares his experience in what he calls the astral worlds and then the higher set of realities he calls the causal plane, and then he gives quite a bit of specific context to what those universes are like, those realms are like. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I won't attempt to be that specific, but I can at least say that yes, we tend to go—to put it very generally—we go where we resonate. We go where we vibrate. So, you could say the quality of your being and also your karma, which just means the cause and effect of all the choices you've made and whether you've been loving or fearful, tend to help guide you into future experiences that will be beneficial for you and for others in the long run.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And now, what about bad people? Because it sounds like—no offense, I don't think this about you as Christian Sundberg—I'm only repeating what you said. You were a person who was very, very unkind in previous lives. Once you said, "I had one previous life when I was so—"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The thing is that okay, we tend to think, "Oh, good people and bad people." There's duality talking again. So, the thing is though, the nature of spirit itself is love. Your true nature is love, no matter how many layers of crap have been piled on you in this life. Your true nature is love, and spirit knows that, and spirit sees that. Okay, but what there is though is a difference in levels of evolution. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You say we are each at a different stage in our evolution, and that makes it sound like duality, but for a second, let me just point out though that evolution doesn't necessarily mean it's not like a scale A to B. It'd be like saying, you know, I use this metaphor before, but I kind of like this metaphor. Like, if one person is like a grapevine, and the other person is like an oak tree, which one is more evolved? Which one's better? Well, you can't really compare them. One might be able to bear sweet fruit; the other one might be strong and have a thick trunk. They're just different. So, I'm just pointing that out because what we really have is difference in evolution.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And okay, so then though, what's the main thing that we're processing? And the simple word that I use is fear. Fear just means yet unevolved. It just means a part of us has rejected reality, and then when we do that, when we have fear, then this crazy fast thing happens here on Earth all over the place. We're living in a world that currently has—at least historically has been—and that is ego arises. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And ego is just the portion of the self that's really trying to do its best to fix the problem because now there's this big missing thing. "I don't feel connected to the whole anymore. I don't feel powerful. I don't feel loved." So, we just grab onto anything we can to try to get that power back or to try to get that love back or to try to prove to ourselves, "Look, I have value now because look, I got a 4.0 in college," or "I have value because I have money," or "I have power because look, I can harm the person next to me and be mean right now, and my ego makes me feel better for two seconds." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, our world—so I'm just saying we express through ego fear that we have. So, to your question, all I'm saying is this fear that I came to process in this life—in a previous life, it overtook me, and I became an egoic monster because I was so afraid. So, ego and bad—the bad person you could say—it just means they have fear, and that's okay. I'm not saying it's okay to cause damage. I just mean that it's okay to recognize, "No, no, no, it's okay if you have fear. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We can actually love and accept one another anyway." In fact, love is the answer to all that fear. And when we really process our fear, we grow in love, and then the ego doesn't have to be there anymore. It doesn't have to have an us versus them thinking anymore. It doesn't have to do that because the love, peace, joy, and freedom is our true nature. It just automatically rises up and shines as we process all the crap, as we process all the fear.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Philosophical Reflections**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Philosophical_Reflections**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Philosophical Reflections</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where philosophical questions are raised about fear and the nature of existence." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_philosophical_questions_are_raised_about_fear_and_the_nature_of_existence."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where philosophical questions are raised about fear and the nature of existence.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, this applies because some of the people you're talking about just sound like mean jerks, which is different than serial killers or dictators. Does it do the same thing?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't draw a big distinction, really. Okay, actually, because my fear is the same as Hitler's fear. The only difference is a difference in scope or actualized effect. Now, I'm not saying that the actualized effect isn't important. Oh, it's important. We should not hurt each other. We should do our best to be compassionate and love each other. And there are different degrees of fear, and there are different degrees of power that fear wields. But fear is always insane. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's just the bottom line. It doesn't matter if it's a small fear or a large fear. Fear is always insane, and where ego is operating, it's insane. It's going to cause damage or hurt others in some degree. It's just that some of those individuals reach points of power, and then we have methodically wielded ego through many of our societal institutions actually because we've institutionalized us versus them thinking. We've institutionalized certain predatory economic patterns. You know, like, we really are deep in this ego game. That's just where we've come from. It's just because we have so much fear because the limitations are so extreme. So, we have to like worry about all that so much. It's just if we can go into ourselves and find and process our own fear, that actually helps the whole world to move forward and heal.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, this is getting maybe a little philosophical, but can't fear be good at times? Like, let's say there's a deadly pandemic, and you're scared, so you decide to stay home, and you save your life and vulnerable people's lives. I'm scared to drive 100 miles an hour on the highway, and that's probably a good thing because not only is that protecting myself, I'm protecting other people. Are there not fears that are good in those senses?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The way that I use fear is somewhat philosophical in the sense that I'm using it in the context of that which is the only apparent opposite of love. There's no actual opposite of love, but it's the only apparent real thing that we're dealing with here, and that is yet unevolvedness or rejection. The examples that you listed can all be undertaken without fear. You can be prudent and wise without fear. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You can recognize and decide not to drive 100 miles an hour, and you don't need fear to be the thing that tells you not to do that. No, you know, like one of the simple examples is in our society, we have a relatively crude justice system. It works, but it's not perfect, of course, and good people end up being hurt. So, the question is, do you need laws to prevent you from murdering someone? If you do, we should have some laws, and we are at the point as a species where many people do need laws. We do need the structures because we have the fear. But if there was no fear, if there was no ego, we wouldn't even need that. You see, because love is our true nature. I know that seems like a super far way away from where we are now, but I think it's important that we remind ourselves in that direction because that loving nature of spirit is the truth of what we are.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That reminds me of an interesting quote. I feel so bad I don't remember who said it because it was really great, but it was someone in response to a religious fundamentalist—and I'm not knocking religion, anyway, I'm knocking a very fundamentalist version—but a religious fundamentalist had written, "Without a belief in God, what stops you from raping and killing all you want?" And the person responded, "I am raping and killing all I want. I don't want to rape or kill anyone. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The amount I want to do that is zero, and the amount I've done that is zero." And I was like, "That makes so much sense because yeah, I don't, you know, as of now, I don't—I can't say I don't want to murder in the sense I don't want that on me, but if I had a chance to murder someone who was maybe like a serial killer and I could save a lot of lives, that would probably be the right thing to do. I don't know if I could do it presented with that. I don't know, but in that case, I would probably say if I knew this person was going to go murder like 20 children or just people, innocent people, it probably is the right thing to do, but it's absolutely—and I would probably be tortured with that being the one presented with that choice, but it probably would be the ethical thing."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is a complex ethical point, of course, but I'll just at least make this one comment. I don't want to try to speak to that in breadth, but the person who might go cause harm to others is a part of you. They're your brother or sister. They're one with the ocean just as you are, and the people that they might go hurt are one with the ocean. And so, you can very lovingly acknowledge and with great compassion, "Oh, this person is acting unconsciously. I need to intervene," even if that intervention means physical violence. That might be required. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, here's the thing though, the ego will get a hold of that idea real quick because it wants excuses to play out its own us versus them thinking, its own seeking of power. I'm simply saying that we can act the way that is best for love even without that egoic fear. We can intervene against the person who might do something terrible even with love in our hearts, even though it makes us sad to do so, even if we know that they're our brother and sister. We can stand up and do the right thing, and we don't actually ever need to lose our peace. See, that's the thing. Anytime you feel like your peace is being lost, there's some association, some fear, some ego pattern that is being triggered.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, now we're going on an hour. Do you have time for a couple more questions?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sure, wonderful. Yeah, I've just never had anyone on who's talked about the type of experiences you've had.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, now, NDEers—near-death experiencers—will often say they experience their near-death experience as realer than real. When you—has it been realer than real for you?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, wow, yes, 100%. So, both the out-of-body experiences I've had and the pre-birth experience were a thousand times more real, more lucid than this. I mean, I don't know, I can't put a number on it. A thousand is—I can't even put a number on it. It's just a different—it's like going to an IMAX movie theater and then going back and watching black and white television, and somebody says, "How do you know there's something outside of black and white television?" </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because guess what, I've seen it. It's so real there. Like I said, there is sensory experience on the other side that's so full and rich—sights and sounds and feelings and colors that don't even exist on Earth. And my pre-birth experience is so deep and so personal and so multifaceted. It's not like an earthly memory. It's very—oh, it's so holy and so close to me and so complete. I don't know how to describe it because it's not like one discrete thing. It's like connected to everything, and the realness of that is—it's far more real than even this.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And can I ask you what you mean by that? Like, do you have stronger physiological sensations? Do you feel more alive? I guess I've had very real dreams, very real, but they don't feel as real. I have yet to have any experience feel as real as here.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, yes to both questions. So, we define reality on Earth. We tend to define reality as sensory experience and thoughts and feelings. I saw that you went to this place where there was this object which had this shape and this color and blah, blah, you know, on and on. So, we're very interested in that, and like I said, those do exist in higher systems and even in more rich and real ways. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As an example, one time I was out of body, and I was looking at the grass. Like, this reality—I don't know, I don't know how to describe it or label it, but I was in this place that had this beautiful sky and this beautiful grass, and this grass was so green and so lush and so alive. The color itself was living. The color was alive, and it was a part of me, and I was a part of it, but I also was me. I was also individuated. And I remember staring at this grass and being like, "Oh my gosh, the green of this grass is so beautiful and so green and so rich. I feel like I could stare at it all day and I would be completely filled with bliss just from staring at the green of this grass." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, I was, and then I started thinking, "What makes this so green?" As soon as I started kind of analyzing, in this case, I actually returned to the human awareness because I started using more—I started focusing into my human object set. But anyway, I'm just saying that that sensory experience was off the charts real. The aliveness is off the charts real. This experience is the more dead state. You know, it's funny because we talk about when people die, "Oh, you know, they're dead," and then when we portray in our movies the other side, we tend to portray these gray, drab environments as if life on Earth is the real thing, and that no, no, this is the more dead state right now. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is the much more limiting state. This is the dream, but like in a fractal pattern, like all things arise here in this dream. We might fall asleep at night and have other dreams that are less real. That's like a fractal down a step down, whereas when we awake from this physical life, we are in a higher fractal pattern up, and it's more real, like waking up from a dream. It's like when you wake up from a dream in the morning, you don't have to say to yourself, "Oh, am I in my bed? Is this real?" You just know. You just know this is the real world, and the dream was just a dream. That's just normal. So normal, you get up and you go about and you have your breakfast. It's no big deal. It's like that after we die too. It's like, "Oh, that was just a dream," and that's the more normal, the more real, and it's just obvious.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Nature of the Other Side**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Nature_of_the_Other_Side**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Nature of the Other Side</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"> Where the discussion explores the concept of the "other side" and its limitations, questioning the belief in a limited number of material lives.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And now, you described the other side, which after talking to you sounds so limited because it sounds like multiple other sides, just like calling you know whatever city you live in here the city or the town. Yeah, but is there a risk that it's so vast we can't find some of our loved ones who've also crossed?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, okay, so the question arises out of the belief in distance and separation, whereas distance and separation aren't real. I know they appear very real. The one ocean of consciousness is one thing. It's always connected. It's always connected to every other part of the whole. So, you are connected to your loved ones right now, where not necessarily out in the virtual world of physical discrete world where things look like they're separate, but in the thing that's already one with everything else, and that is your aliveness itself, your consciousness itself, your beingness. Now, here on Earth, that beingness, that aliveness feels subtle. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When we first go start going towards it, it feels like the gross external world is super real. The internal world is very subtle. Okay, but if you go deep enough towards that aliveness itself—I don't want to stimulate the ego too much because this can be a stimulating idea—but there is a point when there's this incredible blissful inversion that can happen where it's like kind of being turned inside out, and the wholeness of your being can be known and felt as everywhere and connected to all things, and in that everywhereness is everyone else too. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, the only thing that you ever need to do to connect with someone who's passed is an intention, a thought. If you have a pure intention—intention is the primary power that we wield as consciousness, not actually physical action, not actually thought. Those things are subsequent to intent. Intent is the real power. It's the movement of consciousness. When you intend to reach out and connect to someone you love, that's automatically a bridge with them. I heard it described by Silver Birch—he's another channeled source, the guide Silver Birch. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I heard him once communicate that from their perspective on the other side, this is just a metaphor, but if someone on Earth has a loving thought or a loving intention, they perceive it like a chime on the wind that they can then follow back to us, and that's beautiful. You know, so then I was just—I just comment though that practically speaking, there's this huge vibrational distance between the Earth realm and that side. What I mean is there's like a Grand Canyon of vibrational difference. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, if we want to actually meet and interact with them, it's often impractical because we are deeply veiled, and we're so focused into these low vibration thoughts and patterns. If we let go of all that and kind of like let ourselves rise up in vibration, and they can sometimes come down, and we can kind of meet in the middle, maybe we have a dream together or a nudge of some kind. Anyway, just a comment about that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Do we even live a limited amount of material lives? Do you ever hit a point where you're just like, "I am beyond a material dimension. I will never be a material level again"?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, yeah. So, the material world is discrete and limited by nature. Like, there's only so many stars, there's only so many houses, there's only so much space, there's only so much time. That's just the very nature of our physical universe. So, to that effect, similarly, then yes, metaphorically, you could say like the soul—like, you're only going to go to college so many days. You don't go to class forever. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You might go a few thousand times, you know, but eventually, it's just not going to be useful or beneficial or meaningful to pursue that anymore. So, it's similar with a physical incarnation cycle. You know, you may have many experiences, but eventually, there's not value in the continuation of it, so you're not going to continue. In fact, the physical is such an alien state. It's like, you know, it's quite a cost to come here because now we have to actually really experience these difficult themes that can be very rigorous and potentially challenging. So, you know, would we want to do that forever? No, no, not really.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and when someone has gotten to this really high state, is there a limitless level of high state, or do you then just go and try to start accomplishing other things and continuing to grow to higher levels?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The simplest answer I feel is that evolution never stops. We ever refine towards greater and greater levels of being. So, there isn't an end. The linearity of it is a creation itself. There's no linear end. You could say that love and joy have no limit. So, because they have no limit, evolution—we will participate in evolution without end, without limit, and that's a beautiful thing, not a curse. You know, some people think, "Oh, I don't want to do this forever." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, that's because anytime we think that, it's because we are incorrectly believing that existence sucks. Like, we're believing that association with form is negative, so life must be negative, and I don't want to do that forever. In fact, just a quick comment, when we notice that we're doing that, it means there's something in ourselves that we haven't yet integrated yet. There's some opportunity for expansion that we haven't quite allowed yet. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And yes, I know that when we look at this rich world with all of its difficulties, it's easy for the mighty ego to rise up in righteousness and say, "No way, I reject this. There's no way I'm going to be okay with this." But the thing is, love is not about rejection. It's about acceptance and embracing and compassion and full feeling and full being. When we can really do that here, then that is like—you could, I'm using this word very loosely, but that is like graduation. When we fully come to accept all of the physical, all the feelings, all the limitations, all the responsibility, all the love, that's like—then it's ironic because then it's okay if you come back, but now you don't need to anymore.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, people like that have come back here. Who would they be on our planet?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I mean, I'm only surmising, but I feel like Jesus would be a great example, perhaps the Buddha. There are many saints throughout time. You know, like I said, I'm reading <em>Autobiography of a Yogi</em> right now with my wife, and there are a number of amazing individuals who are very spiritually aware listed in that book. It's not particular to a specific religion or country or time period. It's that—see, this is the thing. This is really important. Really evolved, loving beings recognize the value and power of service. Love wants to serve. It wants to give. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, beings who are very loving and evolved—loving and evolvedness are synonymous. You see, so very evolved beings want to come back and serve. I'm reminded of this one book—I forget what it was—I think it was a Bob Monroe book where he was interacting with a guide who is very evolved, and he asked her to show him like where she resided, where she was, and he saw this really downtrodden slum, and it was this very difficult, you know, poor place with lots of difficulty, and he said, "Why? What? You're so loving and wise. Why would you be there?" </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And she said, "This is where I am needed." You see, that's the nature of love is to come back for those who yet have fear to help others grow in love and to heal and to return to the formlessness that we are, to basically work through and integrate all this so that we can step past it and realize the form never had what we're seeking. The love and the joy of being—it already preceded all the form. It already transcended the form. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, we could say we come back for those who might be lost in the illusion of form still to help until we return to that love and that freedom of our being rather than to being, quote-unquote, lost, trapped, or enslaved within association to form. We're not actually ever lost or trapped or enslaved. Never. I'm just saying we experientially become trapped because of our association with thought and with the form and with the stimulating of all the sense data of the Earth and all the rest.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, just after we've done all the physical, either we come—there's still always more to do. So, sometimes we'll come back here and be the higher level. Sometimes we'll be doing stuff in dimensions you or I—or at least I can't understand. You do understand deep down though. I'm not special. It's we all know, even though this might not intellectually make a lot of sense. And I encourage the big question mark underneath. Your being knows and intuits the freedom that I'm referring to.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Where can our listeners find you, follow you, stay up to date?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so right now, I just have a website, <em>A Walk in the Physical</em>.

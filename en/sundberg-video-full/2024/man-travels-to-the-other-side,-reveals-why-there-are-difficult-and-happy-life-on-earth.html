My name is Christian Sundberg. My body is 44 years old right now. So, 14 years ago, I went through a personal Awakening process. I began to have out-of-body experiences, and I had pre-birth memory returned to me. I remember the process of choosing this life and why. I remember the Incarnation process, and it has been very life-changing for me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Up until the age of 30, I did not remember it, though as a very young child, I did have some pre-birth memory awareness up until the age of five or six. So, between five and 30 approximately, I had no memory of this. But now, I'm very passionate about sharing who we really are outside the Earth play because who we really are is so wonderful. Our true nature is so much love, peace, and joy. So, I'm just so passionate about sharing that with each other while we're here playing these human characters that we play.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Essence of Being and the Choice to Incarnate**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Essence_of_Being_and_the_Choice_to_Incarnate**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Essence of Being and the Choice to Incarnate</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian delves deeper into his pre-birth experiences, describing encounters with other beings and the telepathic understanding of their essence.

He explains how he was inspired to incarnate into a physical life to experience growth and refinement, despite the challenges it would bring.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'll share about my pre-birth experience again. I have to just say once more that language can't speak to this. Okay, so I remember a long ago, before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical and feeling telepathically from him the quality of his Essence, his nature. Because in those Realms, we can feel from each other our nature, our quality. I could sense from this being this incredible depth of freedom, power, and love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I asked him, "Oh my gosh, like how do you, what did you do to become this? Do you feel as much Freedom as I feel that you feel?" And he shared with me, yes. He shared with me this great depth of being that he knew. I asked, "How did you do that?" And he said, "Well, okay, so he'd share a number of things, but a chief among them, he had lived physical lives, and one of them, in particular, was a very difficult physical life where he suffered from a physical health condition that stayed with him for a long time. The way that he chose to meet that health condition allowed a refinement of his being. He grew, you could say he evolved. It's poor language, but he deepened, maybe refined who he was to such a degree that, oh my gosh, it was just so beautiful."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I said, "I want to do that. I want to do that." Like, I was so inspired. And he said something, well, first, it was something along the lines of, "Well, that's what they all say. Like, you just don't know how hard it is, how hard it can be." Because I was just ignorant to how challenging a physical life could potentially be because I hadn't been physical before in this way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I persisted. I said, "No, really, like to do this. I mean, this is amazing." And he said, "Well, go talk to your guides." So, I don't have right after that, but I did live many times, and I went and found this being later, and he was encouraging.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But the majority of my pre-birth memory is of a Time somewhat immediately preceding this life. So, I had lived, and after I had passed, I took a long break in between lives. I remember this guide coming back to me over and over, "Are you ready to go back yet? Are you ready to go back yet?" And just like gently putting him off, like, "No, I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready yet." And finally saying, "Okay, yes, I'm ready now."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then reviewing with this guide my state, like who I am, what I had known, what I had been. It was very obvious the thing I needed to work on. I don't like the words "work on" because it's not a task, but I could see and feel what would be best for me to do. It was this very specific fear that had bested me in a previous experience, and I could see that if I could integrate that fear, heal that fear, that would be an amazing expansion for myself and for the whole through the integration of that fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, they brought me a life that was very appropriate to meet and process that fear. It wasn't this life; it was an immediately preceding life. I reviewed that life in great detail, and I accepted that life. Then, I remember accepting the veil. The veil is just the word we use for the limitations in Consciousness that we wear in order to have the physical experience, and it includes forgetting. That's like one of the chief things: we forget everything else that we are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I experienced it as a plummet in vibration, down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more lower, more like the vibration in my being going from being connected to everything and in total Bliss and love all the way down, down, down, down, down, lower, so low, and then lower more, and then lower more into this very, very dense, empty feeling but dense experience of being physical and having all my knowing cut off and all my memory disappear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm not doing this. There's no way." Like, I could feel that emptiness and that denseness, and I felt disconnected from everything. So, I responded in Fear, and I summoned my might, and I fought my way out. I pushed past the veil. I broke past the veil, and I was successful in doing that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I had a Life review because I could see that I'd killed the body. I'd killed the fetus that was to be mine, and in my life review, I could see how my fear impacted the poor mother because I had heaped grief upon her. Not only the mother, but hundreds of other people, like in ripples away from the mother, because the mother's Journey was more difficult. I had made hundreds of other people's Journeys more difficult because of my fear and my rejection of that life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I could just see very objectively, like, "Oh man, I got to do something about this." Like, from that state of being, you know, it's okay. Like, nothing's wrong; it's just like a big play. You can't actually fail. But I also could just see very objectively, like, "Wow, I have a lot of fear. I need to do something about that."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I still had this intention to meet this fear and to process this fear. So, then I spent some time in what I would call a veil acceptance simulator. I know this sounds crazy, but it was like a room where you go and practice surrendering your control to a veil, like being dunked underwater in a pool over and over, but you can cry Uncle. You know, you can say, "Let me out," and I'll let you out because that was just practice.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I could tell you, the real Veil is more difficult than the simulator. So, okay, but then later, I remember them bringing me this life as Christian, and this life was very appropriate, but it wasn't as good as the first one would have been. It was a good match, but it wasn't as perfect.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember reviewing this life in incredible detail, reviewing millions and millions of possibilities of how this life might unfold. It was like reviewing a flowchart of possibilities, like if someone took a tree and laid the tree on its side, and you started at the trunk, the thick part, and you worked your way out to the branches. It was like that, where the branches were all the possibilities that might unfold in the life depending on my choices and the choices of every other player in the game, every other person.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I could see events, but it wasn't primarily about events. It was primarily about what would it be like to be me, like what would I feel, what would I experience. That was really what the review was primarily about.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember making certain requests for this life. For instance, I asked to be intelligent again. I knew that I had been intelligent in recent lives, and they said, "Yes, you can do that." And I knew that it would be important that I be male in this life, just because of a certain energy. Like, male and female just have different energies, and there was a certain obtuse Edge, you could say, to being male that would help me to meet the fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I could see that my parents were very important. Like, my father would instill confidence in me, and then that confidence would be important for me to have a rock to stand on when the fear hit later in life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, after reviewing it in detail, I remember there having to be a moment to say yes. And I don't remember that moment, but I remember being in a waiting area, and this guide coming to me and being like, "Go now, like right now," really grabbing my attention.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then being in this room that I can only describe as a technician's chamber or like a tinkerer's shop, where there were these beings who are very technical in nature, and they are Veil application technicians, something like that. I know this sounds really strange, but their very nature is skilled at matching Veil to soul for a given life because each soul is so complex with all its qualities, and each physical life has so much Rich context.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And they do this thing where they make it Jive, they make it fit. So, I could feel them preparing the veil, and I was standing over this shaft with the Earth below me, and they asked me one last time, "Are you sure?" And I knew that once I said yes, I would be in for the ride, like a roller coaster. Once you get on, you can't get off until it comes to a stop.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I said yes. And then once again, I remember this plummet in vibration, down, down, down, down, down, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, more lower, still low, low, low, even more, then lower more, then lower more. It was ridiculous. It was such a drop, and having all of my knowing cut off and all of my connectedness disappear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then being in this very dense, empty, cold, by comparison, not cold temperature, cold energetically, state of being in the womb, feeling like just totally crammed into a tiny, dense object, and also feeling separated from everybody else and everything else.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And sending one message back to the technicians, "Did it take? Did the veil take?" Because I knew that if I had not rejected the veil like I had done the first time, then it would be a successful start to a journey.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And they sent one message back, "Yes." And so, then I actually felt accomplished because I knew that even making it to the physical is a big accomplishment because the vibration here is so low that even just making it to this place is an amazing step. It's an amazing journey.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so then I was there for a while, and eventually, I said, "I'm not doing this. There's no way. This is so dark. This is so empty. I can't feel my connectedness. This is so low vibration. I am not going to tolerate this for a whole lifetime."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, once again, I began to summon my strength to fight my way out, and as I did that, the most holy moment of my whole life happened. This is so hard to describe. The Great I Am presence of all things, what we call God, came to me and expanded me back out.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I felt all the universe within me. I felt all the stars, all the galaxies, and I felt our son, the son of Earth, within me like it was a part of my body. And it was churning with bliss. It was like this raging ball of bliss, just amazing and conscious and alive, and all of it was alive, and it was all within me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And God said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this." And that calmed me because I was like, "Oh, I didn't lose all that I am. I see." So, I stopped fighting, and I turned to just being in the womb.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Birth and Early Childhood Memories**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Birth_and_Early_Childhood_Memories**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Birth and Early Childhood Memories</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian recounts his memories of being born and his early childhood, including his ability to recall pre-birth memories and predict future events.

I remember the shock of being born, the temperature, the sound, the touching, the lights. I remember being very curious.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And yeah, and then as I grew, I remember looking back at the pre-birth memory, the flowchart memory in particular, and trying to see what I could predict about what was going to happen based on what I had seen before I had incarnated. Just small things, like as a child, "Is someone going to come to the house tomorrow?" or "Where are we going to go as a family?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I would just try to pull the information out of the flowchart just for fun, and that ability diminished as I aged. You know, until probably about the age of four or five, I couldn't do that anymore. And then about the age of five or six, I couldn't remember it at all.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, that's a quick summary of the pre-birth experience. I've shared it a number of times now. I'm happy to share it, but I don't think it's the most important thing. I think what's far more important is the reminder of who we really are, each of us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">My experience is just my experience, but what's more important is your experience. You know, what are you really? What are we really? We are really multi-dimensional beings of love, peace, joy, and freedom. That is our true nature, and we have come deeply into this veiled experience of Separation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, like we are very deeply experiencing this perspective, but it doesn't change what we really are. And if we know what we really are, we recognize there's nothing to fear. There is absolutely nothing to be afraid of. Like, all of the fear can only arise when we buy into self-perceptions that are ultimately not true.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I think it's so important that we share with each other and remind each other, even while we're veiled here, who we really are and the great power that is available to us and the great love that is there for us. Oh my gosh, it's so important. It's so powerful.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Shift in Collective Consciousness**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Shift_in_Collective_Consciousness**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Shift in Collective Consciousness</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian discusses the increasing vibration of collective consciousness, despite the apparent conflicts and challenges on Earth.

That is happening even though there's a lot of friction on the surface. You know, a lot of apparent conflict and apparent disharmony, but in energy space, the energy is definitely increasing. The vibration of the human race is moving in the direction towards love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, even what I sense now versus 10 years ago is very noticeably different. So, I can't make a prediction about exactly where the human race will end up. I think it's likely that we will succeed in Awakening and really heal, but we have a lot of choices to make.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The odds are probably in our favor. We have a lot of help, a lot of help from the other side that's assisting us and guiding us day-to-day as we make these choices, hopefully more out of love rather than fear. That's what all this is about. This whole thing is about, can we make choices that are based in love and everything love means rather than fear and everything fear means, the ego, and everything else?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Can we make those love-based choices? That small space decisioning that each of us is doing is where we're changing and growing, and it actually does help the whole, the larger framework that we see around us. You know, the governments, the companies, the monetary systems, those are all things we made up as humans. So, as we change, they will change over time.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Navigating Life's Challenges and Embracing Love**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Navigating_Life's_Challenges_and_Embracing_Love**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Navigating Life's Challenges and Embracing Love</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian addresses the difficulties of life on Earth, comparing it to climbing Mount Everest.

He explains how fear arises from unevolved states and encourages individuals to face their fears, heal, and embrace love, peace, and joy in their personal lives.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This life is potentially very hard, yes, because we have incarnated into a place of great limitation. So, it's not actually that this life has to be hard; it's only that we've come to a place of extreme limitation. So, it's like going to Mount Everest is a good metaphor. You know, that tall mountain that everybody climbs when they're really at the Pinnacle of their Mountain peaking career or whatever.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not that Mount Everest has innate qualities. It has certain properties of limitation. It's cold; there's no air. You know, it's kind of like being on Earth. And when it's this dense, this limiting, when we feel this degree of separation, it means it's very possible that when we are yet unevolved, when we have yet Evolution to do, we've growing to do, that we might respond in fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You see, fear is just a symptom of unevolvedness. That's all it is. But fear gives rise to all sorts of pain and suffering on Earth. It gives rise to the ego and to all the beliefs, all the us versus them mentality, all the judgments, all the anger, all the hatred. You know, it comes out of fear, and that fear is just so.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's just that Earth is a very high limitation environment that has the potential to prompt fear in us. As we prepare to move into this new time in Consciousness, I think it's important to focus on our own place, and what I mean is our own State of Consciousness first.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Don't worry so much about everyone else. Don't worry about what's on the news so much. It's important that we remain cognizant of it. We want to know what's going on, but what I mean is your primary place of work is your own Consciousness, your own self, your own life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Basically, can you move towards your own personal love, peace, freedom, and joy in whatever way in your own life, even if it's a small way? And can you work past your fear? Can you heal your own fear? Can you look at your own fear and really process it?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Those two edges of the coin, you know, choosing love, growing towards love, and yet also not being afraid of the dark, facing the pain, facing the fear, owning it, processing it, healing it. Those are both synonymous. They're both a move back towards the truth, which is love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, if we do that in our own lives, in our own minds, and our own Hearts, oh, that is the real work. And a change in you is a change for the whole Collective consciousness. So, if you shift that in yourself, you are doing far more than enough. Like, that's you're doing a lot if you do that in yourself.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then, as you do that in yourself, of course, we will be there for each other. We will reach out and both physically try to impact the world and help those around us, but also, we then automatically energetically do that. We help each other, but it does start with where you are in your own life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, basically, you're free to choose love, peace, freedom, and joy, and you're free to own and face your fears, your deepest fears, the deepest rejection, whatever you're rejecting in this life. Like, that's another way to put it. Like, we can participate in the Awakening by finding our own rejection.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Maybe we even reject the negative states of the world, and then we lose our peace. Do you need to lose your peace? No, no, you can actually like, basically, rejection of reality is what fear does. It is, in a sense, the primary problem that everybody is rejecting what is Arisen and fighting and pushing.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, can you accept yourself? Can you accept your life? Can you accept this reality? Can you accept so deeply that you then own your piece of it and shine in love and joy right where you are, knowing the freedom that you have, that there's nothing that you really have to do too?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, can you sense that true nature that you are where you are, that is doing enough for the whole planet and The Awakening on the planet? This life can be extremely difficult. I'm not underplaying or understating the level of rigor and pain that is possible here. It can be extreme.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, it's like wearing a thousand pounds on you, being human, and when there's pain or disease or when you're in a society that is particularly dysfunctional or you're under economic duress or whatever else. I mean, each one of those things changes the constraints. It can make it easier or harder, but the thing is, no matter what has arisen in the physical, there's a great quote I love from Bashar: "Circumstances don't matter; only state of being matters."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so that may sound a little cheesy until you really investigate it because what's happening is form is arising within Consciousness. So, Consciousness always retains the power. So, when you feel powerless, when you feel that you've become deeply wrapped up in the form and in the stories, take pause and investigate your own Consciousness.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Meditate is a way to say that. I love there's a phrase from Asia, I don't know which country, but something to the effect of, "Meditate for an hour a day unless you don't have time, and then meditate for two." I find that that's appropriate when our lives get very hectic and when we get overwhelmed by the content because the more we look at it, the more we rehearse those chaos stories in our mind, the more difficult it can be to see clearly and feel clearly.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, it's important that we take pause and evaluate very objectively in our own Consciousness, "What am I in the midst of this?" Seek the eye very objectively with great alertness. Go investigate the eye, and that will allow us to get a foothold to stand on in Consciousness so that we can better see the thoughts for what they are and see the forms for what they are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so that's one thing. And then another thing is recognize that we are placing all the meaning on what has arisen, even if it's hard. Like, nothing arrives already charged, even pain. It's not already bad when it arrives. It's just a sensation. It's just alarming to the body, but it's not bad.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, we always assign meaning to our lives. So, we can locate, "Okay, where have I named this rigorous context as terrible? Where have I done that?" Now, that takes a lot of humility, bravery, a lot of willingness to feel because it means owning our place in the story, but there's a lot of power in that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are Consciousness first. We can own the meaning that we have put on our story. Okay, and then the third thing I would say, meanwhile, don't be discouraged because this entire play is happening in a much, much, much deeper context that is made of love, peace, joy, and we are watched over always. All is always well, even if the world is crashing down around us.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I'm not making light of the rigor and density that crashing down can evoke, but in the meantime, the first two about Finding who we really are in Consciousness and recognizing the meaning that we're playing, those empowering steps, those the side, even if we haven't done that yet or can't do that yet, at least in our intellectual space, we can know, just remind ourselves intellectually, "Oh, I really am a multi-dimensional being. I may not be able to see it very clearly right now, but there is nothing to fear."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Know that. Remind yourself of it, and then check, like, as I say that, like, you may, if you really check into yourself deeply, intuitively, how does it feel if someone says, "You are a multi-dimensional being of love. You have nothing to fear. Like, you are powerful. You are worthy. You are so loved, like so ridiculously loved, you personally."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Surely, you can feel deep down that we resonate with that because the part of us that is deep down knows the truth. It always knows the truth. So, even if we're in the midst of this very challenging circumstance set, we can listen to that deep down voice. It's always lifting up the real encouragement, the real hope, and the knowing that there is nothing to fear and that you will get through this. It will be okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Start there. So, I think probably backwards order, so maybe 32. Once, start with knowing it. Second, identify the meaning you've put on the circumstance. And then three, go find out tangibly what your own Consciousness is. Just three ideas to speak to your question about what we can do if the life has become so physically challenging, so difficult.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Soul's Purpose and Choosing Life's Challenges**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Soul's_Purpose_and_Choosing_Life's_Challenges**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Soul's Purpose and Choosing Life's Challenges</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian explains that souls choose their lives, often with the guidance of wise beings, to experience growth and expansion.

He discusses how difficult lives can offer valuable lessons and contrasts that lead to deeper understanding and spiritual evolution.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We do choose our lives, yes. We choose our lives, usually with the help of guides who are very wise beings who help us to evaluate the opportunities of lives. Every soul is different. We all have our own Journeys, our own walks.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In my case, I had a very specific goal. Goal is a bad word, a very specific energetic aim, and they brought me lives that were appropriate. Like, they went and reviewed the databases, you could say, and they're very wise, and they could find a good match, you know, a life that had a fruitful match.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, I know that to the human who is suffering, it may be very hard to understand why we would choose a life that has so much pain in it or so much limitation. You know, like, "Oh, why didn't I choose to be rich or to have an easy life?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, but the thing is, the soul is not after a small experience of wealth, physical wealth. The soul is after deep, Eternal, true expansion of being and growth, which is the deepening of love and joy. See, that's what it's after.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, through contrast, contrast is a tool that has been offered to us, and so we may choose lives of high contrast, especially in a certain area, if we want to learn, not intellectually learn, but learn at the being level, learning by being something.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If we want to learn some perspective, some virtue, some quality, some experience, some angle of experience, you know, that is what the contrast offers. Yes, we do sign up for lives so that we can experience something, grow in a certain direction that is Meaningful to us at the higher level.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And by the way, when I say the soul and the higher level, I don't mean some other being. I mean you. Like, sometimes we think, "Oh, my soul signed me up for this. Now I'm pissed." You know, but no, you are your soul. You see, you are the bigger you having the experience of being a smaller you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You are you. You're always you, and so you, at the deeper level, had some reason, some meaning. And also, the other thing I'll say is sometimes we come primarily out of service. You know, like, sometimes there might be someone that we know or love, and they're coming to experience something, and you know, we know we could help them and be there for them.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, maybe we would sign up for a whole physical life just to have one conversation with somebody at one moment that they really need it. You know, there's so many reasons. It's difficult to nail it down because the soul is very rich and complex, so its intentions are also rich and complex and unique, very unique.  </p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">

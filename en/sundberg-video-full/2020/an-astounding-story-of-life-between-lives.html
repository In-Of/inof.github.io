Everybody's joining. Hello, hello, welcome! Got a few more coming in.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Hi there! Hey Shelly, hey Bettina. Shelley, we miss you. You need to move back. I don't like you living so far away. I'm not a fan. Michael and Sandy, great to see you guys. Wendy, hello with your groovy background. And there's Lourdes. Hello, everybody's coming in.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are going to have such a fun time tonight. I'm really looking forward to this. Let's just make sure everybody can join. Here comes Edie. Hello, Edie. There, I just admit, admit. There we go. We're going to have a pretty big group tonight, so I want to make sure everybody has a chance to join in.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Let's see here. There's Peter. Hey, Peter, good to see you. And Carla. Hey, Amy, how are you? Do you know I think about your dream all the time, Amy? That's been like one of my little data points. It's like right in there. And Donna. Hello, Bruce. Hi, how are you? Hey, Edie. And Bettina, Mary, Jennifer, Vicki. Hello, Susan.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All right, everybody's coming in. Jamie, I know there's a lot of people who are going to be watching this on the replay as well because our timing is a little late for some. So for those of you who are catching this on the replay, we welcome you as well. I'm going to be monitoring the chat tonight, so as we go, if you guys have questions for Christian, just let me know, and I will let him know.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Let me just make sure we have everybody grouped here together. All right, so I believe all of you know about Wisdom Soup, but just in case you are less familiar with Wisdom Soup, we are a spiritual community that has been meeting now for over three years. We started here in the Seattle area back when meetups were held in person, and then we started remote broadcasting the meetings, and that grew to a wider group. Now we're online, so we literally are all over the world, which is super fun.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As you guys know who are part of this group, we're a group of friends. Pretty much everybody that's drawn to this group, we're just a bunch of super, super "woo" light workers, and we go full "woo" with our topics. We talk about everything from dream interpretation to past life regression to every type of anything in between, dowsing. It really is like whatever sounds interesting and fun, that's what we talk about.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's about that we always are continuously learning. One of the best things we can do is we are all learners, we are all teachers, so we have so much to learn from being with each other, right? From each other and from our experience. So anyway, that's what I find. This process and being part of this group has been a big part of my own spiritual growth. It's been super important, not only in terms of just the subjects that we cover but also in community.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, we all know that as you raise your vibration, you fall out of resonance with maybe the friends that you grew up with or the people that have been in your life previously, and we need our community. We need our people, and that's why we have groups like Wisdom Soup.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We do meet every month, the second Thursday of every month, but for next month, we are going to meet two days early because many of you guys know I have channeled some information about events that may unfold on 11/11. If you don't know about that, please go to my YouTube channel. I'm not going to go into that because that's a whole subject I'm not going to go into tonight, but that's on my YouTube channel, which you can search my name and Tucker on YouTube and hear all of the channelings on that event and what's coming.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But we may not be able to have our usual timing of that next month's meetup. It might be an unfortunate timing, so we're going to move it up a couple of days. I'll make sure I post that a few days early so that we all have a chance to join in and get together again.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All right, so for tonight, we have a speaker I'm very, very excited about, Christian Sundberg. He has a very modest himself, and he thinks that what he knows is not that interesting, and I think it's incredibly fascinating, and I think you guys will agree with me and not with him.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He is one of the few people that I've ever met who has an incredibly clear memory of experiences that he had on the other side. I'm super excited for him to share those memories and stories with us tonight. There's still a few more people joining us, but let me go ahead and get you any.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Introducing Christian Sundberg**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Introducing_Christian_Sundberg**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Introducing Christian Sundberg</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian Sundberg is introduced as the guest speaker, and he shares his background, including his work in the nuclear industry and his journey of recalling pre-birth memories.

He explains how his early childhood memories of the "other side" faded but returned in his 30s through meditation.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian, you are already all set. Your video is on, so Christian, I'd like to introduce you. If you would introduce yourself.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Christian:</strong> Sure. Before I introduce myself and get started, I'd like to be really cool with this group with all the energy I feel here. If we could just take 30 seconds to do a very, very brief meditation with each other and just set our intention together as a group because there's, like you said, a lot of light workers here. Oh, my goodness. The connectedness, the connection of this group is very powerful. So if we could just take 30 seconds, I think that would be really, really cool.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is an amazing group. So yeah, I'll introduce myself briefly. On the human side of things, I've worked for 15 years in the nuclear industry, managing projects of nuclear valve and pump manufacturing projects. I don't totally identify with my human work, but I guess that's how we're supposed to introduce ourselves in our society.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I think it's more important to speak to who we really are, which is something far greater than the human. So in my case, I live in Pennsylvania. I lived in China for a while. Just kind of a normal guy. But recently, in the last couple of years, I felt called to share some pre-birth memory that had returned to me in my early 30s. I'm 40 now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When I was a young child, before the age of five or six, I had clear memory of my time before I was physical, before I was this human character, and I thought everybody did, and nobody talked about it, so I didn't talk about it. But I used to draw upon that memory very commonly as a small child.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I kind of cheated a little bit because I had kind of seen ahead of time what my life would be like, so I was kind of always peeking around the curtain to get an idea of what to expect. But that memory left me at about the age of six or so, six or seven for sure. So I had no memory of that at all for most of my adult life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I just grew up with kind of a standard environment, and I learned what I was taught and all the rest of that. Then in my 20s, I went through a traumatic experience, which I had signed up for before I had come. So I went through that experience, and I did a lot of healing from that traumatic experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Then at the age of 30, I began a long-term meditation practice, and much to my surprise, I began to have non-physical experiences, out-of-body experiences, and I also began to have this memory returned to me of choosing to come and my time immediately preceding this life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When those memories returned, it was like, "Oh, my gosh, like this is the most natural thing in the world. How did I ever forget this? It's like right there." But I'd forgotten because I'd been so physically focused, so tied into all the labels and all the identity and all the rest.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I felt actually for some number of years that I shouldn't speak about it. I felt like the timing just was not right. But a couple of years ago, I felt okay, the time is right. There's enough people ready now that we can talk about this.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I did share. I shared with Mira Kelly, who is a wonderful woman, and I shared in a couple of other places, and it's gone an amazing response. I've met amazing people like almost every day. I'm meeting new people, and it's just been an amazing process.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I'll share, and please, anybody, please do interrupt. Any thoughts or questions or ideas, this conversation is fluid. Everyone here is a master in their own right, so we're all in dialogue with one another. So I'm just going to recount my experience, and then anybody who wishes to interject, please do so.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Nature of Non-Physical Existence**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Nature_of_Non-Physical_Existence**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Nature of Non-Physical Existence</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian discusses the challenges of describing non-physical experiences and the limitations of language.

We are consciousness itself, non-physical, and within the non-physical arises the world of form, arises things, objects, experiences, and words.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Words then can't speak to that higher nature because they are formed themselves. They're symbols. There's no words I can just say that could possibly even remotely touch the other side or these experiences. I just have to make that really big disclaimer to start.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so that being said, I remember a very long time ago. Again, these experiences all have a sequence, but they also are kind of happening all at once. Even now, I feel like these memories are happening now. They're not so much in the past, and yet they're simultaneously now. I don't know how to describe that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So my earliest memory is before I had ever been physical, coming across a being who had been physical, a very powerful, beautiful being, and I was completely overwhelmed by the quality of his nature, by who he was. He was just so beautiful and full of joy and power, so much potential and amazingness.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was amazed by the quality of his nature, his essence, and I asked him, and again, this is telepathic because there's something on the other side. "Oh, my goodness, how did you do this? Look at what you are." And he shared with me that he had been physical, and he shared with me specifically one life that he had where he had suffered with a very difficult physical ailment.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't know what it was, but some kind of pain or long-term suffering, and the way that he met that experience was incredibly powerful. He expanded in an incredible way because of this experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I asked him, "Were you healed all the way?" Like, as I saw how damaged he had been, and he shared with me, "Yes." And I kind of sensed the depth of like this damage of being physical that he'd experienced and how he'd healed all of it and this amazing expansion that had taken place within him.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I said, "I want to do that. I want to do that. I'm going to do that." I was so fired up. I was totally committed, and he didn't quite brush me off, but it was a little bit of like, "Yeah, that's what they all say."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I was like, "No, I'm serious. I want to do that. I want to go do that. I want to have that experience. I want to be physical." And he said, "Go talk to your guides." So I did.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that was a long time ago because since then, I had many physical lives, and I went back and found him later and showed him, not to show him, but how to converse with him and kind of share with him, "Okay, see, I'm on the path. I said I was going to do this, and here I'm doing this."  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Decision to Return" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Decision_to_Return"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Decision to Return</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the narrator recalls taking a break from physical existence and the decision to return, prompted by reminders of their intention." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_narrator_recalls_taking_a_break_from_physical_existence_and_the_decision_to_return,_prompted_by_reminders_of_their_intention."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the narrator recalls taking a break from physical existence and the decision to return, prompted by reminders of their intention.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so now I'm going to jump a bit because there's a lot. Okay, so now I'm going to jump to a bit that's somewhat immediately preceding this life where I had taken a long break. I had lived many experiences, and I took a long break. I just decided I was gone for a while. I was not doing a physical thing for a while.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was taking a long break, and I remember this guy coming to me repeatedly over and over, "Are you ready to go back yet?

So I was surprised at how incredibly deep that fear had been for me, how deep that fear was in me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I wanted to re-engage that fear, and as I reviewed this, I knew the incredible amount of expansion that would be possible if I could do this, if I could meet this fear and integrate this certain energy to this degree. I just knew it would be unspeakably beautiful and powerful if I could do that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But even then, I could see the vibrational distance was so extreme that I remember asking the guy, "Is it even possible?

It was like almost as good as they get.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I accepted the life, and I accepted the veil. Okay, so the veil of forgetfulness, this process of incarnating, is what I remember the most out of all this. And that process is very abrupt and shocking.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So in this life, I accepted the veil. The veil came over me, and then I was in the womb.

I fought my way out, and I succeeded in doing that. But I had killed the fetus. I had killed the body that was to be mine, and I feel responsible for that. I feel sadness because when I got to the other side, I had a life review even for that very short life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I reviewed, and I remember seeing the mother and all the hundreds of other people that would be negatively impacted. I could feel how I negatively impacted the mother. I heaped more difficulty on her through the sorrow of her loss, and also hundreds of other people whose lives would be made more difficult because I had made the mother's life more difficult.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I couldn't believe it. I was like, "Well, I mean, it's really hard to describe, but I went in with great intentions. I had all these good intentions. I had this big plan, and then I just, and then my fear was so great that right at the beginning, I caused that."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I not only did not succeed in my intention, but I caused the game to be more difficult for the players that I so loved and respected.

Before I did that, I practiced accepting the veil because I didn't want to have that same thing happen again.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I remember going to this place that can only be described as like a veil acceptance simulator room. It was like a place you go where they practice surrendering to the veil and having your knowing cut off and feeling separate and dark and alone.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And it's kind of like diving into a pool and then seeing how long you can stay underwater, and then you can jump back out if you get too scared, but you practice.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember practicing, and basically, it had to do with my willingness to feel the fear and my willingness to allow and not resist. So after doing that, they brought me this life, and this life was not as optimal as the first one would have been.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was still good. It was quite good, but each life is only so good because the soul, the spirit, is rather complex. And what makes it up, in my case, I just knew I had many qualities and a certain type of my nature, and that nature has to interface with the life somehow, and then that has to work within the context of what you're trying to do, what you want to do.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And this life was pretty good. It wasn't perfect, but it was good. So I remember reviewing this life in great detail and reviewing what I can only describe as a vast flowchart or like a tree of all the things that might or could or would happen in this life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And there were, it started like kind of like if you imagine a tree tipped on its side, like a thicker trunk, and then it went out to branches, and there's all these paths. Some paths were very likely, some paths were a lot less likely, but it wasn't about events.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, I mean, there were definitely events in it, but it wasn't so much about events as how it would feel, how it would be to be that person in these different possible avenues of how this life might unfold.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I went through millions of possibilities all within the blink of an eye. It was easy to do that. I remember reviewing just tons of huge amounts of information all at once.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I knew even then that it was very likely that I would experience a trauma in my 20s that would crush me and that would help facilitate my opportunity to re-experience this fear that I wanted to re-experience and integrate.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I was super excited to do this, to accept this, even though I knew it would be hard. And I knew that the body, this body, had certain limitations that other bodies do not, and that this body would be difficult in certain ways on a day-to-day level that would challenge my ego or something.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It would make it difficult for me in a way that I would be forced to turn inward, and I would have to find strength. And also, I wouldn't be able to go totally down the ego path because it would be too challenging.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So anyway, I reviewed all this, and I remember there having to be a moment to accept, and I don't remember that moment, but I do remember after that waiting for this to start the life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I was in a state where I was still timeless, and it was wonderful. And I remember this light, this powerful light, and then I remember the guy coming to me and being like, "All of a sudden," and not rude, but almost rude, like, "Now, go. Now, you have to go now. Right now."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Getting my attention like, "Super, like now, buddy." So I was like, "Okay, now." So then, alright, the next thing is I was at these beings that I can only describe as tinkerers or technicians. These beings who are like technical in nature, and they helped apply the veil to me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So they do this. I don't know how to describe it. There's this thing like the spirit has certain nature and qualities, and the life is certainly something going on in the body, and they have to do this thing where it like, I don't know, they make everything fit somehow.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So they were doing that, and they asked me one more time, "Are you sure?" And I knew that this was the point of no return. If I said yes here, I was in for the ride. I was strapped in.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember saying, "Yes," and then the veil coming over me again. Okay, so this time, my intention was, "Okay, just don't fight it. Just let go. Don't resist. Just allow."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember, okay, so like this drop in vibration is meaningful to explain, but if you imagine like an amp that produces a pitch, and then you have a vowel, and you turn it down, when it turns down, well, I turn all the way down, and then turn down more and more and more and more and more and keep cranking down.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's how it felt in the vibration of the being coming down into this super dense, super tight, super cut-off, like going to the vacuum of space. I think is a good metaphor. I like to use it. It's like you go to a place where there's just no heat and no air. There's just empty space.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's how it felt, but also super dense, like coming down and being shoved into a tuna can, like a fish can. And it was incredibly jarring, but I just strove not to fight it.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Veil and the Womb Experience**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Veil_and_the_Womb_Experience**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Veil and the Womb Experience</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian describes the intense experience of the veil being applied, the drop in vibration, and his struggle to accept the separation from his higher self.

I said, "I don't want to forget everything. I want to have just a tiny, tiny little amount of memory, just a tiny little bit."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And they said I could do that. They had said that I could do that, but it would make it more challenging. It would make this life more difficult because the contrast would be even greater.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And at the time, I knew that even that contrast was like all contrast, an opportunity for growth. So I accepted. So anyway, as the veil came over me now, I was feeling this, and there was like this little window open that I surmised.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't know for certain, but I think it had to do with that request because I had this little window open that was not available all the way, and I remember holding on for a super long time and being like, "Oh, my gosh, this is crazy," and sending a signal back through the window.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Did it take back to the technicians? And then sending one signal back, "Yes." So I knew that the veil had been successfully applied, and I allowed myself to be in the womb in peace for a while.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So then I was there for a while, okay, and it was all good. And then eventually, I said, "I'm not doing this. This is like the darkness and the cutoffness and the lack of connectedness." And I was like, "Stuff, I'm not doing this again."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So again, I reached this point where I'm like, "This is ridiculous. This is just so ridiculous." So at that moment, I began to summon my energy again so that I could fight my way out again.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But as that happened, I had this very humbling moment, and it's like the most holy, precious memory for me. I remember the spirit of God coming to me and showing me that I was still all that is.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It showed me the stars and the solar system, and I remember feeling the churning of the sun, the joy of that, and knowing that was still me. And the spirit said to me, "This is still what you are. You can never not be this."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Most only thing for me to remember because that's what we really are. That's what all of us really are. And it's very hard to remember that now because I feel deep in the human experience right now. I'm not close to there right now. I'm deep in the weeds.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But at the time, it called me a lot, and it made me relax, and I was like, "Oh, good. Oh, that's good. I'm still that. That's good."

I remember the day I was born. I remember just one visual image of the room after I was out, and I remember seeing the layout of the room.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then when I was older, I drew the room from my mother, and I said, "You were here. The bed was here. Here was the window. Here was the heating grate. Here was the doctor." And she said I was right, which I knew I would be.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But beside the visual memory, that wasn't the most important memory. The most important memory was just like the experience, the shock. There was no context yet. I was just, I had no intellectual context whatsoever. I was like a clean slate.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So it was just sense data and stuff going on. There was cold and shock and light and touching and very intense sense data. And I remember being intensely curious and looking around and being like, "What is this place? Where am I?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And looking at these beings who are taking care of me or doing whatever they're doing and being in awe of them and actually feeling love for them. And actually, it's funny because just last week, I was talking to my father about this memory, and he said, "That's interesting."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He said, "Because the day you were born, your eyes were wide open, and you were looking at everything with such an intense curiosity." And he said he couldn't believe that such a young baby could have such an intense curiosity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember that. I remember being like, "What is this?" So after that, I don't have any memory for years after that first day. I mean, I have some very vague memories of looking up at my crib, looking up at the dangly thing that's supposed to get my attention, and being happy when my mother came to get me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Some brief memories like that, but when I got older, when I was like two or three, I just assumed everybody knew that we weren't really from here.

She was asking about, so when you took on this life, the fact that there was, you said, some ego challenge. Was that complementary to your purpose, or was that part of your purpose?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I think it was complementary, and I think it was both because it complemented the growth, but it was also very much important that I do that because if I wasn't challenged in that way, I don't think I would have the ability to meet the big kahuna fear when it arrived.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, I needed to have a day-to-day challenge to be able to be in a place where I can meet the fear. And like another thing, I know that had to happen is I knew that my father was important because I knew that my father would instill a confidence in me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He would build up my confidence a lot as a child, and that confidence would be really important for me to have a rock to stand on to face this fear.

I mentioned this in the other video, and they said, "What about how females can excel?" Of course, that's not what I'm saying. It's just that the female and the male energy are just different, and there's a certain kind of an edge that I needed to call, even an obtuse edge or something.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I just needed a certain edge to be able to meet the fear in the way that I needed to meet it. And nothing that's nothing to do with male or men or women being better or worse or anything like that.

Donna is asking, "Why is it necessary that we hide from our true selves?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so if you weren't veiled, you would be the unveiled you, and the unveiled you is connected to all that is and is unlimited and is full of power and connectedness, and there is no duality to strive against in that because that's you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You are transcendent of that. So to put it in a mundane way, so like, if you knew that you were the sun—I like to use the sun because that's what I experienced in my womb experience—but if you knew that you were connected to the sun like tangibly, not just as an intellectual idea, but you could feel the sun in your being, and you could feel its bliss, and you knew that you were the stars, and you knew that nothing could, you know, get up in the morning and eat your cereal and drive to work?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, you wouldn't because you'd be the sun. You wouldn't be you. So if you want to be you, if you want to be the separate you, then it's actually a huge opportunity to be veiled because it means that now there's this unique perspective from which you can integrate from, and that perspective is an incredible opportunity for expansion.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Which there's a, okay, this is an important idea. So, and again, I'm drawing a line because in duality, but because we're in duality right now, but this is beyond duality. So you've got source, okay?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So if you imagine that is like a sun or something, a source of light, if you can go like this far away from source or this far or this far vibrationally, and then you can integrate that experience and be fully there, then there's this expansion that takes place.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is so beyond words. That's very, very, very powerful, and that's only possible if you are the human immersed all the way in the human character. It's exactly that immersion. It's exactly that consistency and the denseness of the experience that gives it the edge that permits the expansion that we are looking to.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So is it defining our finding our way back to source from so far a distance is what causes the expansion of spirit? I think that's a natural thing. I think that's going to happen naturally as one does that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not that the goal is simply to find one's way back to source because you're already source. You're already the drop in the ocean is still the ocean. You are still the ocean right now. You're not actually separate.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is a really important point. None of us are actually separate from each other. We are not separate from God or source, whatever we want to use. We're not. Okay, so but though, if we come into this defined experience and we want to integrate this experience, and integrate means we fully experience it, we bring love to it, we bring openness to it, we learn how to be our true loving joyful selves in that experience, whatever it is.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As we do that, the expansion naturally happens, and we naturally end up returning because we were already there in the first place.

Absolutely. Well, I'm still in the process of integrating this fear. It's too big to do all at once, but I've taken very important steps in this life to do that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So when we talk about fears and from the human perspective, we like to say a fear of something, you know, like a fear of spiders or something. It's bigger than that. It's like a vibration. It's a state of being in which one is distant from source in a certain vibrational way.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the way that I could best describe that would be, and this has to do with the negative self-perception, okay? Because fears ultimately arise from a negative either a negative self-perception or a perception that's negative about the world.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So there's always some, we fear is always because we bought into some perception that is not in alignment with the truth. So the truth is we are powerful. When we buy into the perception of powerlessness, we feel fear.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The truth is we are loved. We buy into the idea that we are not loved, we feel fear. Anyway, in my case, this specific fear was a fear of inability to escape agony mixed with being too proud to suffer.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, reject, so being stuck in pain and being too proud to, like, kind of like stuck in pain and not resisting it. So because that was the fear, I have had some very interestingly painful experiences in this life, which is okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's okay because ultimately, there's no experience that I choose to not reject. Any experience that's my goal because there is no need to reject any of the experiences. But in my case, I was in Chengdu, China, and I intended to live in China after I graduated from college.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And in this case, physically, what happened was I had a heat stroke, and I was in a Chinese hospital for four days, and I was given a large amount of potassium—bag after bag after bag after bag of potassium.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It caused some kind of neurological burn in my whole system that was absolutely agonizing, and I was stuck in that for weeks. I also, my body had a whole bunch of other problems, and it was just agony.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I suffered trauma from that. I was in a hotel room in China for a while. I had lived in China in Beijing in the year 2000. This is 2002 that this experience happened, and that experience went on for a while, and I was traumatized from it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I went through years of counseling to face the feelings and the fears and the sensations that I experienced in that moment. See, I'm a really sensitive person, and actually, that goes hand in hand with having some memory of pre-life because I knew that if I wanted to have some memory of pre-life, I'd have to be very sensitive.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, the experience was even more intense. I experienced everything pretty intensely. So the moment that I rejected for many years was a moment I was laying in a hospital bed in China, and I felt like I was going to die, and there was no way to escape this pain.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that was it. It was very, very, very dark, a vibrational moment. So yeah, I don't, I no longer have trouble viewing it now. I have set an incredible amount of things into momentum in my own experience because we set momentum with our intention, with our beliefs.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It creates momentum, and things arrive into our experience from that. And so, there are moments when I have, you know, some serious, you know, significant pain at times, but that's okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't resist. I'm not, reality is not our enemy. So as things arrive to us, we can allow them and feel them and meet them with openness, and I'm striving to do that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I love that. I think that is a message I keep getting over and over again: to allow what comes, yeah, to see what arises and to accept it and to work with it.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Q&amp;A: Pre-Chosen Career Paths" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Q&amp;A:_Pre-Chosen_Career_Paths"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Q&amp;A: Pre-Chosen Career Paths</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian admits he had no pre-birth memory of his career but suggests it may be significant for some, recalling an intuitive childhood vision." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_admits_he_had_no_pre-birth_memory_of_his_career_but_suggests_it_may_be_significant_for_some,_recalling_an_intuitive_childhood_vision."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian admits he had no pre-birth memory of his career but suggests it may be significant for some, recalling an intuitive childhood vision.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another question that came in is, "Did we pre-choose our career path as well, or is it insignificant in this whole journey for our profession?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't know. Not sure. Okay, I can't say categorically. I can say in my case, I had no memory of, well, I just say pre-life. I had no memory of the job I would do, but as a child, I actually, interestingly, had an intuitive moment where I pictured this one room where I would have a business meeting.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then, like, I forgot about that, and a few years ago, I was in this room having this meeting, and I had this moment where I came back, and I'm like, "Holy crap, I saw this like 30 years ago."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, so this, but that's, see, the system, spirit is very good at predicting outcomes because it has all the data.

So she's curious about hierarchy on the other side and what does that look and feel like.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so I won't try to speak to the hierarchy overall on the other side, but I will just say that love is that is the hierarchy. So in my, okay, so like, I think a metaphor would help.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So if you had, like, let's say you took a beautiful maple leaf from a tree, and you put it next to a large flowering grapevine, which one is better?

Each spirit is gorgeous and unique and meaningful. But in this case, in comparison to what I could do at the time, this being was incredibly powerful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Actually, that reminds me of an interesting quote from Bob Monroe. He's an out-of-body explorer. Many people here are probably familiar with Robert Monroe's books.

It's that as we grow in joy and love and as we conquer fear, power is the natural result, especially in other systems that are much less constraining.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is the constraining, super crazy place. So if we can master things here, holy cow, we've got it made when it's a lot easier. It's like metaphorically, if you go and, I don't know, you go run a marathon, it's not hard for you to jog a quarter of a mile.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not, you know, you've already run a marathon. Kind of like that.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What is it to be powerful on the other side? Is it to be, what do you use that power for? What are you doing? So there are different reality systems, and there are different rules in them, and most, I don't know, I'm not like an avid out-of-body explorer.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't have tons of experience, but the experience I've had and from my pre-birth memory, my understanding is that many other systems are thought-responsive, intent-responsive, and the nature of who we are immediately has an effect on the environment or on what we can do.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So when consciousness evolves, its capabilities in those environments evolve. Now, that's like more of a tangible, you're asking power like, "What can it do?" You say, "What can it do?" So that's more like, to me, that means more like something tangible.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So in a reality system, there's a way that spirit can better execute, better, I don't know, actualize, I guess, its nature when it has evolved. I'll put it that way. But power overall, the true power is love, beingness itself.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That is the only power. So I can't really answer, "Oh, well, you can move some rocks." No, not about moving rocks. It's about being, beingness with a capital B, and as beingness expands, it's beautiful and powerful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, I mean, people who have had near-death experiences or spiritual transformative experiences, you experience interacting with source. They convey power but also amazing total love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's the true power: the love of surrender and who we really are, beingness itself. That is the power. So when we can take that beingness and reflect it here in a circumstance, that's powerful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Let's say you've got an illness. Let's say you just heard you got a really terrible illness. How do you meet that moment? That's powerful. If you meet it with love and openness, that's power.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, we like to take words like power and then define them. You know, we're like, "Oh, okay, I got these words. Okay, so what is this?" And we always want to know, "What is this thing? What is this?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's bigger than that.

Like one time, I was walking down my steps. This is kind of a funny story, but I had, I was walking down my stairs, and I was out of body.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I gave myself permission to get up from bed, and I got up from bed, but I didn't actually get up from that.

Like, it's so normal. So I'm walking down the stairs, I'm feeling the carpet in between my toes, and I'm feeling the cracks in the wall, and I get to the bottom of the stairs, and I actually concluded I was not out of body because it was so normal.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I actually thought to myself, "I'm the only guy in my city walking down his stairs wondering if he's out of body." Like, I actually felt dumb because I'm always exploring. I'm always trying to ask the questions because you've got to like have that mindset if you're going to, so but then I got to the bottom of the stairs, and the light was just a little bit different, and I'm like, "Maybe I'm out of body."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So how else can I test it? Because I could feel the wall. I could feel the carpet. So I decided to try to walk through the wall in the front of my house, and I did. I walked through it, and I was in the front yard, and I was like, "It's a good test. Oh, my gosh, I'm out of body."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that was one experience, but I think that's actually the only time I've had an experience where I was that local in my house kind of thing.

I've also had experiences where I've interacted with someone. I've had four times. I like to do this little experiment when I, if my body's asleep, and I have a non-physical experience with somebody, I like to try to prove it the next day, like a hobby.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So if I meet the person, I usually try to get their attention in a way that I can confirm with them when we wake up.

You need to be able to experience what you really are, which is awareness itself, without having thought constantly bombard you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then once you are thought itself, or I mean, thought itself, beingness is self-awareness itself, you will find non-physical things will rise to you all on their own.

I feel like as a male, I'm like, it's like impossible for me to actually feel what a woman feels that can't have a child.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I know how deep it is, and then, and I'm actually chuckling because I told my wife many times that I kind of wish I could have a baby because I remember being female, but anyway.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I would say that so all the things in this life that we experience, there's a lot of needs that the human has: need for food, need for reproduction, need for security, need for money, and love, physical, you know, all those things that we think we need.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We do feel fear when we don't get that stuff. You know, if someone tells you you're not going to have your food anymore, you know, most people are going to feel fear, and not being able to have a baby is pretty similar, actually.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I think in the sense that we are hardwired to do that, so I don't, so just as a general comment, then when we have fear that's linked to something that is wired into what we are as humans, I think it's important that we, I know this sounds so simple and trite and oversimplified, but we need to accept.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because when we resist, it's the resistance that hurts, and typically when we resist, we're not helping ourselves. Typically when we resist, we're making it difficult. We're pushing things away, and it's the deepest intent that is nudging their probabilities.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So a lot of people might say, "Okay, I really want to have a baby, so I'm going to tell myself I don't want to have a baby so that I can have a baby." But really, your deepest intent is you still really want.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So what you have to do is work with your own fears. I know it's a very broad comment. Find the fears. Find like, if you feel an inadequacy, papa, need it be a, "Why do I feel that way?" You know, what?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then as you feel that, allow yourself to feel it. Allow yourself to find what is the negative self-belief I'm holding on to here, and be brave enough to work with it. And if you get to the root, that might help.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and so I know the question was about like a lineup of souls. It's not like they're, I don't want to say my perception was not like they're pushing or pushing in line and, "Please make this baby be available."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's not like that at all. Like I said, the system is operating, and then as there are opportunities, they are happily utilized.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, yeah, and sometimes it's not the mother's fault. I mean, in my case, it was my fault. It's still my fault. I don't even know who that person was, but I know I'm responsible even now.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And you know what I mean? So that's nothing to do with the poor mom. She probably, you know, I mean, they didn't know there's a spirit coming from another dimension that like had fear issues, you know.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Q&amp;A: Earth’s Uniqueness and Beauty" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Q&amp;A:_Earth’s_Uniqueness_and_Beauty"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Q&amp;A: Earth’s Uniqueness and Beauty</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian denies Earth’s exclusivity as a 3D reality or the most beautiful, citing greater beauty in higher realms." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_denies_Earth’s_exclusivity_as_a_3D_reality_or_the_most_beautiful,_citing_greater_beauty_in_higher_realms."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian denies Earth’s exclusivity as a 3D reality or the most beautiful, citing greater beauty in higher realms.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So she was asking, she's wondering about, is Earth the only 3D reality? And is this Earth the most beautiful place in the universe?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Okay, so I'll say no. This is not the only 3D reality. So first of all, we have our whole universe, and it has many opportunities within it, not just Earth. Okay, don't we?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We'd like to think of other planets as other, no, our whole universe is one place. There's other planets. There's a whole system that's big, billions and billions and billions of stars. Okay, that's one system.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I have some awareness that there are other systems, and I don't know anything about those systems, but they're there. So there are many opportunities both in our reality system, and I believe others as well.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And as to whether Earth is the most beautiful, my opinion is it's all subjective. No, I feel that there is greater beauty in higher realms. The beauty of the higher realms is unspeakable.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I'm not saying, you know, Earth isn't beautiful. It has beauty, but yeah, I personally wouldn't say it's the most beautiful experience of form possible. I felt like that green grass was awfully beautiful.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, my gosh. All right, well, if anybody else has any other questions, go ahead and ask them now, but I think this has been, for me, this has just been so incredible.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Your story, as soon as I heard it, I couldn't wait to have you come in and share it with us because I feel like it's stuff that we all know about. We've read about it. We learn about it from various sources, but you are the first person I met that can stand there and tell me from first-person experience what you're not, you know, not from a regression.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because I know that a lot of people go through past life regression, which was made like Wendy was talking about in the comments. She leads past life progressions, but in this case, it was your actual lived memory, which is just amazing.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Closing Reflections and Gratitude**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Closing_Reflections_and_Gratitude**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Closing Reflections and Gratitude</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the host and participants express gratitude for Christian's sharing of his experiences.

The session concludes with reminders of upcoming events and how to access the recording.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that's, it's such a gift to have you share that with us, and it's wonderful. I think it's wonderfully encouraging because it is such a confirmation of all the things that we feel and that we suspect and that we intellectually know but that we don't have direct experience of anymore in terms of our memory.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I feel like I'm in a really weird place because, on one hand, it's extremely personal, and it's also impossible to articulate, and also, I feel like it's such a small amount of memory.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, who am I? You know, I'm not in your death experience or, I'm just some guy. On the other hand, on the other hand, I really feel that the awakening, as we're using it, is happening.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We do need to talk to each other, and we are allowed to test this. It's not like the veil is like, you know, you got a moral imperative not to, you know, play. You know, we're here to play.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so I'll take the risk. I'm, you know, I'm just deciding to take the risk and get it, put myself out there a little bit, and say, "We're not human. You're not human. You, you, this is important that you that feels like you to you is who you are."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, that you, you think is human is not the you that feels like you to you is who you are. And it's funny because one time after meditating, I had this experience where I became aware of all these other lives I had lived.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Just, I saw these fears. I knew that I was them, and it was like the biggest shock to me of this moment was like, "Oh, my gosh, that's me." Like, I did that. It wasn't like other people that were me. No, it was me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, the me that feels like me to me, what did those things? Yeah, yeah, so it's just so it is the eye, and that eye is not just, not just this character.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I think it's important we remind each other of that because our society is pretty darn unaware overall. Yeah, our world, especially up till now, has been largely asleep.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We've got some serious fear issues going on in the collective. You know, we're working through them, and, you know, as we do that individually, that is what we got to do is we need our fear individually, and then that helps the collective, and we're participating in that valuable process.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So yeah, wait, so I think it's important to remind each other. I'm happy to speak with anybody who would like to, you know, it's just gonna make connections with people.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And can you share the name of your blog? Christian writes a blog.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, it's "A Walk in the Physical." A Walk in the Physical.com.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A Walk in the Physical.com. Perfect. I haven't added anything lately because I only write when I'm spirit-led on that blog. I don't just sit down and write, and I'm trying to turn that into a book.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm in the process of doing it, so I'm like maybe 90 percent through.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Supreme, yeah, sorry, because I want to try to put it in some framework that is helpful, hopefully.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Wonderful. Yeah, well, you've gotten so many thank yous here. Wendy, Edward says, "Thank you. This was wonderful." She says, "I feel so comfortable with the knowing being more validated. Thank you, Christian."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Edie says, "This is a wonderful, eye-opening gift. So grateful for this talk." Sheila says, "It lands like remembering, and that's cool. A resonance resonates deeply. Thanks, Christian."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Amina says, "Thank you for sharing these profound experiences." Patty says, "We are immensely grateful for this talk. Thank you, Christian." Teresa says, "The veil is spinning. We will so assist be so surprised by what we encounter."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And Jen says, "Thank you, Christian. Really well articulated. You convey a much larger perspective than words can convey. Thanks for being you."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, Barbara says, "Support each other." Peter says, "The act on the stage with the 3D life." Sheila, Shelley, "Thank you, Christian. Your experiences are amazing." Sheila says, "Thank you, Christian. Very helpful and timely. Thank you."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ann, you're very welcome. Thank you. So anyway, thank you. Get it. Rock on, dude.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Barbara, I really appreciate everybody that's here. I can see all these faces on the screen, yes, and I'm telling you what, like, this is a group of masters. You know, there's a lot of potential and power here, and it's an honor to even talk with you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I appreciate it very much, and thank all of you for everything you're doing in your lives right now, and thank you for being human. Like, you may not when you woke up this morning, you probably didn't think you're like a superhero for getting out of bed and brushing your teeth, but you are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So thank you for doing that, and we wake up tomorrow. It's okay to remind yourself of that, you know, that you are a superhero. So yeah, I just feel like that's like the one thing I just want to share with everybody.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's cool. Like, thank you for being you and for being here, and you're like, you have guides like watching over you, cheering you on too, and you know, you're not alone.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For those of you who'd like the link, Michael and Sandy just posted it in the comments. I will have recorded this, and I'll be posting the recording both on YouTube and on the Wisdom Soup Facebook page.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With some soup YouTube channels, if you go onto YouTube, you'll see it there. Just type in Wisdom Soup, or I'll also be posting it in my Spirit Means Business Facebook group. So either place, if you want to watch it again, you can find it there.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And like I said, you can contact Christian through his blog.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thanks so much for spending the evening with us, Christian. This is just as good as I thought it was going to be, even better. So it's just amazing. So great to spend time. So thank you, everybody.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Wonderful to see you guys, and I'll be sending out the next invitation again. It will be rather than doing the second Thursday, it'll be a couple of days early.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If you haven't seen my videos about what's coming on the 11th, do go check it out. There's some big stuff happening. I want to make sure, excuse me, that everybody is prepared because it is something we do need to be prepared for.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So thanks so much, and I will say goodbye for now.  </p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">

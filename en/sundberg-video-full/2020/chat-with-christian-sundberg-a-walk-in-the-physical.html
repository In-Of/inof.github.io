experiences.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Hey guys, I'm really excited to be here today with Christian Sundberg and to be diving into an amazing experience that he's had and learning more about, yeah, you Christian, and your interpretation of everything that happened with you. I've heard your story, but a lot of people haven't heard your story, so I'm excited to share your story more. So yeah, do you want to kind of share a little bit from there?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sure. So, it's very difficult to talk about this story because, as I shared in the other video, I feel like words just can't possibly do justice to our higher natures, to who we truly are. The context from which we come transcends duality itself. It transcends all earth form. So when I used to use words and throw metaphors at you, and then you have to interpret them within your own experience, it's just incredibly limiting, and there's very little we can actually communicate in this way. So that's just a big disclaimer up front because I feel like every time I even just open my mouth, it's just wrong. As soon as I speak, that's just how these things are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, okay, when I was a young child, I had pre-birth memory. I remembered coming to Earth. I knew that we weren't from here naturally, that this was a place we were coming to visit and have a neat experience, and I assumed everybody knew that, but nobody talked about it, so I didn't talk about it either. I used to kind of draw upon my pre-birth memory when I was very little, and then eventually, as I got older, it faded away and passed, and eventually, I didn't remember it at all. I ended up growing up with a very mainstream mindset and belief system, and that carried through many years of my life until I was in my early 30s.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What is a mainstream mindset?  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Religious Background and Shift in Perspective" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Religious_Background_and_Shift_in_Perspective"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Religious Background and Shift in Perspective</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he discusses his religious upbringing in the Lutheran church, his spiritual beliefs, and the transformative impact of Tom Campbell’s lecture on his perception of reality." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_discusses_his_religious_upbringing_in_the_Lutheran_church,_his_spiritual_beliefs,_and_the_transformative_impact_of_Tom_Campbell’s_lecture_on_his_perception_of_reality."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he discusses his religious upbringing in the Lutheran church, his spiritual beliefs, and the transformative impact of Tom Campbell’s lecture on his perception of reality.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, mainstream life. So, I was also raised in the Lutheran church, and so in my case, I viewed the world in a very mainstream Lutheran belief system metaphor set for many years, which is fine, believing in God and Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. I did, and I don't even say "did" in the past tense. To me, I always knew that they were metaphors in a way. The word "God," what is that? So I pursued a relationship with the divine through that metaphor set, and I had certain beliefs that I had been brought up with about that. I had no memory at that time of what I'm about to share.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So for me, it was like once the memory was gone, I just learned what was taught to me. The church was the place in society where, if there's spiritual stuff going on, there's a bigger context, and the place in society that existed to teach you about that was the church. There wasn't really anywhere else, and that's where they talked about God and the spirit and eternal life and these things that I just intuitively sensed existed. So that's just the way I pursued it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But then, in my early 30s, I was actually watching a Tom Campbell video because I was always searching. I was always seeking, and seeking is just naturally what I do or who I am. He said one sentence in the video that sent me down this whole path. He said, "What you believe is not going to get you anywhere particularly important. The belief itself is not going to get you anywhere important." It stung when he said it. It hurt my ego, and I was like, "Oh, I don't like that." But when I felt that, a little voice inside me just kind of nudged, "Why does that hurt? Why does that sting?" I was like, "Yeah, why does that sting?"  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I watched Tom Campbell's Spain lecture, and I was fascinated. I bought his book. It's funny because I got the book. His book's a hefty tome. I got it, and I'm standing in my garage, looking at this book. This is before I went down before I had the gun meditation practice or anything, 10 years ago or so, and I thought, "Man, am I really going to read this book? How big this is, it's going to take a while." I opened up the first sentence of the preface, and it says, "Yes, you need to take the time to read the preface." I thought, "Well, this guy knows me."  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Meditation and First Non-Physical Experience" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Meditation_and_First_Non-Physical_Experience"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Meditation and First Non-Physical Experience</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where meditation leads Sundberg to his first non-physical experience, an intense and frightening out-of-body episode that opens a new chapter in his understanding of existence." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_meditation_leads_Sundberg_to_his_first_non-physical_experience,_an_intense_and_frightening_out-of-body_episode_that_opens_a_new_chapter_in_his_understanding_of_existence."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where meditation leads Sundberg to his first non-physical experience, an intense and frightening out-of-body episode that opens a new chapter in his understanding of existence.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So anyway, I learned what I could from Tom's videos. I started reading his book, and most importantly, I began meditating. I was not expecting anything. I just began meditating because the first few times I did, I felt life feels really good. I'm experiencing some relief and some things I don't understand. After I meditated for just a few months, I actually had my first non-physical experience spontaneously, and it actually scared the crap out of me because it was so real.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It wasn't like a wishful imagination thing. In this case, I was sleeping, and I was having a dream that I was about to be killed. In the dream, I said to myself, "Okay, let go, leave your body now," because I thought I was about to die. Suddenly, I was in a state of extreme vibrations, and I was awake. I was fully lucid. My body was not awake, but I was fully awake and lucid, and I was experiencing these very violent vibrations. It sounded like there was a jet engine on either side of my head. It was so loud, and I was stuck there for a few seconds, and I was like, "What is this?" When I finally woke up, I jumped out of bed. I physically leapt out of my bed because I was so freaked out by how intense this experience was.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Returning Memories and Purpose of Life" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Returning_Memories_and_Purpose_of_Life"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Returning Memories and Purpose of Life</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where meditation triggers the return of past-life memories, leading to an understanding of his pre-birth planning and the role of challenges in shaping his current life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_meditation_triggers_the_return_of_past-life_memories,_leading_to_an_understanding_of_his_pre-birth_planning_and_the_role_of_challenges_in_shaping_his_current_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where meditation triggers the return of past-life memories, leading to an understanding of his pre-birth planning and the role of challenges in shaping his current life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That was just the first of what turned out to be many experiences that were very eye-opening. As I continued to meditate, I didn't anticipate this, but I just suddenly started having memory return to me that I had when I was a child that I'd forgotten. Memory about why I came, what this life is, what I'm doing here. It's been very helpful, and I know why it was very important that I forgot. I would not have been able to experience the trauma that I did in my 20s, which was a very important part of why I came. I came to face a fear, to feel and integrate this very low vibration. I don't know how to describe it, but this certain vibration that had bested me is the best way I can put it in another experience in a past life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In that past life, I had experienced an agonizing death as a result of what this fear did to me and where it took me. So I now know that it was important that I re-engaged a very challenging sensation of fear and experience of fear in this life.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So yeah, I know there's a lot. What you just shared is really hitting home for me. Okay, so you said you came in here and you had these memories of what life was like before you came in here as a child, right? But then as you started growing up, around maybe five or six, definitely by seven, these memories faded, and then all you knew was this reality that here you are, Christian Sundberg.

It's a long story, and it's hard. It's very hard to share, so I'll just say as concise as I can. So I remember a very long time ago, before I had ever incarnated in this reality, being inspired by a being who had been physical, who had incarnated. The quality of his being, the quality of his nature was so full of light and joy and power. It was incredible, and I was inspired by him to go down this path and to begin to integrate experience. It's the only English words I can think of, to come into experiences like this with a certain level of denseness and to meet them ultimately with love.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As Tom Campbell says, it sounds almost frightening to meet it with love, but love is our true nature. Who we really are, what we really are, is freedom and joy and power and bliss. Then we apply what we are into these very specific contexts, and it's so exciting for the soul to do that. There's just the most profound, blessed, amazing honor. I don't know how else to put it, to be given the opportunity to do this because there's only so many opportunities like in our reality. There's only so many people, only so many things, so there's a limited number of opportunities, and when you're given one, it's like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so honored," even though it could be very challenging here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Here we are, and for me, because I must be coming from a limited mindset, I'm like, "What do you mean there's like seven and a half billion?" So that's a very small number in comparison to the breadth of the higher realities, and I can't put words on that very well. But the finite net, okay, so I don't know if you imagine an extremely big number, like trillions or something, and you've got a few million slots here going on at the moment. Anyway, I don't know. It's really hard to explain. It's just that from that side, it's just a profound opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So in my case, I had a previous experience. I took a break afterwards of not being physical for quite a while. Okay, so previous experience in this physical matter reality. I don't know, I was some physical being. I was physical somewhere, right? Then I had a break, and then I decided I wanted to go back. So then I met with a guide. I remember this guy coming to me and asking, "Are you ready to go back yet?"  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Planning the Incarnation and Life Review" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Planning_the_Incarnation_and_Life_Review"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Planning the Incarnation and Life Review</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he reviews potential life experiences with spiritual guides, analyzing millions of possibilities before selecting a specific incarnation to address his unresolved fears." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_reviews_potential_life_experiences_with_spiritual_guides,_analyzing_millions_of_possibilities_before_selecting_a_specific_incarnation_to_address_his_unresolved_fears."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he reviews potential life experiences with spiritual guides, analyzing millions of possibilities before selecting a specific incarnation to address his unresolved fears.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is very hard to explain because everybody wants to know what did that feel like and where was that. For me, it was more like reminding me of my own intention. Okay, so like, "Okay, okay, you're right." So then I got with this guide, and the guide was like, "Time to get back to work, Christian. Come on." It was kind of like that, but it's like, so we reviewed who I am and what I am, who I've been, and there was it was obvious the thing that I needed to do, the thing I needed to work on. There were many areas that I had accomplished or achieved, but I had been able to actualize myself in a loving way in certain areas.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I felt there's a theme I need to articulate here. So there's this expansion of being that is integral to what we're doing here. This is so important, and we're all walking around our lives forgetting that we're doing this, most of us. This is so hard to explain, but imagine you have source as a point of light, and then if you can go this far away and you can integrate this experience and fully be here and actualize who you really are here, then the growth of being comes to there.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There's like this opportunity for expansion. What is it? The expansion of what is possible. It's the expansion of love. It's the expansion of joy, lasting joy. It's the expansion of power. It's the expansion of what is, and there's a profound joy that's associated with that expansion. So that's important.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So then, in my specific case, I knew that there was a fear that I had experienced in a previous life that was one of my lowest vibrations because duality itself is transcended, but anyway, I had an experience, a life where I was completely overcome by this fear, and I had been an extremely high entropy person to put it in Tom Campbell's terms.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In my last incarnation, this isn't my last incarnation, this is at some point in the past, and it was like a glaring, "Whoa, I can't believe I have that much fear that I can cause that much damage." But it was a profound opportunity, and this fear was so intense that I remember asking my guide because I knew it would be very challenging, super not easy, but when you're on that side, you know you're immortal and that you're powerful enough. There's nothing to fear, so I'm like, "I want to do that."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But I remember asking the guide, "Has it ever been done in all of creation? Has any other being ever done something this extreme, this vibrational extreme?" And I was shown yes and basically reminded, "You don't have to do it at once. You have all of eternity available to you. You've been given all this time."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I thought, so it's totally funny because right now, as a human, this seemed so alien to me, but at the time, I remember fully knowing with this total confidence, "If it can be done, I can do it. If it can be done, I will do it." It wasn't like a pride thing or anything like that. It was like I just knew what we are. I just knew I had a desire to do good because when you accomplish this as a soul, you're not only expanding yourself, you're helping the whole.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We're performing a service right now. Every single person listening to this video today, even if they don't remember it, is performing a very important service just by being here. This is not the easy class. This is not the place to come for a foot-up-on-the-couch vacation. This is a very intense experience engine or something. We're very intense, very in-your-face. You don't remember who you are. You've got to deal with all the stuff of life. You've got to feed your body, take it to the bathroom, earn a living, deal with pain and judgment and all those things. You've got to deal with that every day.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So anyway, back to my story. I knew that I wanted to engage that fear. They brought me a life that was perfect for me to do that, and I accepted that life. But immediately after accepting the veil, the veil of forgetfulness, which is just what we call it as a word, basically, it's the adoption of the constraints and consciousness space that overcome you and allow you to be fully here. It's like a deep, deep dive down into a vacuum where you are obscured.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">All of a sudden, it's an extremely abrupt plummet. It's like taking the blue pill in The Matrix, the one where you forget. You just forget, like nothing ever happened. In this case, it's forgetting, but it's very abrupt.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There's a quote by Seth where he says something like, "To be effective, many of you die and don't even realize you died. You're just there on the other side, and all of a sudden, you look down, your body is there, you're done with your life, and you move on." You may not even notice the transition of that physical death, but incarnation is not like that. Incarnation is very abrupt and extremely noticeable because you're going from a place of all connectedness and joy and freedom down into this tuna can of the human body.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What did you say? The tuna can?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, like a small metal container that you get shoved down within. Anyway, so in this case, I accepted the veil, and that process happened. But each lifetime has its own vibrational place, the only way I can put it, like its own state of vibration that you arrive to. I assume that's biological or something. There's some state of vibration that you arrive to after accepting the veil and incarnating.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Veil of Forgetfulness and Attempted Withdrawal" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Veil_of_Forgetfulness_and_Attempted_Withdrawal"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Veil of Forgetfulness and Attempted Withdrawal</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the transition into physicality is so intense that Sundberg initially rejects the experience, leading to a miscarriage and an immediate life review of the consequences." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_transition_into_physicality_is_so_intense_that_Sundberg_initially_rejects_the_experience,_leading_to_a_miscarriage_and_an_immediate_life_review_of_the_consequences."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the transition into physicality is so intense that Sundberg initially rejects the experience, leading to a miscarriage and an immediate life review of the consequences.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As soon as I arrived, I was overwhelmed by the lowness of the vibration of what I had just accepted, and I immediately changed my mind once I was there. So in this experience, it's actually very emotional, but I rejected the experience, and I mustered my might. I summoned who I am and said, "I'm not doing this." I smote it, and I was out. I was freed.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I knew immediately I had a life review because I had inadvertently killed the fetus that was to be my body, that was to be me, and the mother had a miscarriage. I knew the pain that I cost her, and I don't know who she is. I don't know when it happened. All I know is that I caused a lot of pain, and I knew not only the pain I caused her but hundreds of other people that she would affect in her life in a different way because of the loss that she experienced from me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I went in with all these great intentions, and I was like, "I had all this positive intention," and that had happened. So I was very disappointed in myself. I mean, nothing is wrong from that state because you can just see everything is well. Everything's fine. It's just a play. There's nothing to be afraid of. She's fine. I'm fine. Everyone's fine, but I was very disappointed in myself in an objective way. I was like, "I just can't believe I did that."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that was a really good opportunity that was wasted. Before they brought me this life, I remember practicing accepting the veil and going through that vibrational plummet again. I guess I'd call that in the other video a veil acceptance simulator or something. Some place that you go, and it's not a real veil, but it's like the veil, and you have to surrender to it and practice giving up your control and letting it come over you and being fully present with it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So then I remember them coming to me and telling me it was time. Okay, so they brought me this life. I reviewed it in detail, and I remember reviewing a vast flowchart of millions of possibilities of what this life might be like. Millions, I mean, all within a blink of an eye. It was not hard. It was easy to review millions of possibilities of what could happen, and there were many things that were very likely to happen and some things that were less likely to happen, but it was not really about the events. It was more about how it would be, how I would feel, who I would be, and what things might I feel like, how other people might be affected.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I reviewed that, and I knew that a trauma would likely be following in my early 20s, which would crush me and help me to re-enter, re-experience this fear, and that did happen. That did happen. I had post-traumatic stress from a health crisis I had in China when I was 22, and I dealt with that for maybe seven or eight years of counseling and inner work.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This all happened before I began meditating because I feel like it was important that I did all that without any knowledge of this, and it was only because I've been able to meet a certain element, a certain angle of this fear, that that memory returned, and now it acts as an inspiration to keep going. My own intent inspires me, even though it's hard. Being human is, I'm not saying being human is always hard, but it has a very high constraint set that goes along with it, and there's a very good possibility for extreme difficulty for many people.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So anyway, I reviewed the chart, the flowchart, what I'm calling it. I remember them getting my attention like, "When it's time to go, like, you gotta go now." All of a sudden, I was timeless or something. I was in this state where it was just, all of a sudden, they came, and it was like, "Now you gotta go now. Now you're on Earth time. You gotta get moving."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember these beings that helped facilitate the application of the veil over me and the incarnation. I refer to them as tinkerers because that's the only English word I can think of that kind of matches, but they're beings that are technical in the application of the veil, and that's what they do. What they do is they're able to discern your personal who you are, your vibration, all that you are, and match it somehow to all that the life is.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They do this thing where, like, I don't know, they make it work, and then before you go, they say, "One last time, are you sure? Because once you say sure, this is it. This is the last chance button." You know, I said yes, and then I remember the veil coming over me and surrendering to it and being completely overcome.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I feared again. The vibrational plummet was like, I don't know if you imagine like a sound amp that has a pitch coming out of it that's really high, like a high pitch, and you turn down the knob, imagine turning it lower and lower and lower. After you get to the low point, you just keep cranking it lower. That's how it felt in the being to come all the way down into here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I held on, and I did my best to just not fight it because I just knew that as long as I didn't fight it, I'd be fine. They're gonna take care of the rest, and I just need to let it sink in and take hold of me, and that happened. Then I was in the womb for a while, and this part is very emotional for me, but I reached another point where I said, "That's not happening. I'm not doing this. This vibration is so low. This is, I'm trapped. I don't like this. I'm not doing this."  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Acceptance and Early Womb Experience" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Acceptance_and_Early_Womb_Experience"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Acceptance and Early Womb Experience</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where divine reassurance helps him accept his incarnation, allowing him to surrender to the vibrational constraints of the womb and experience a sense of peace." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_divine_reassurance_helps_him_accept_his_incarnation,_allowing_him_to_surrender_to_the_vibrational_constraints_of_the_womb_and_experience_a_sense_of_peace."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where divine reassurance helps him accept his incarnation, allowing him to surrender to the vibrational constraints of the womb and experience a sense of peace.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So once again, I decided to summon my might to fight my way out again, and this is a holy moment for me, but the spirit of God came to me, and it showed me who I really am, who we all really are.

You can never not be this."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's the most beautiful thought to me because I can't wait to be there again, but anyway, at the time, it calmed me. It made me like, "Oh, okay, that's awesome. Great. Okay, I like kind of going." I let myself just kind of surrender to being in the womb, and it was very peaceful and tight but peaceful.

I remember the room after they pulled me out, and later, when I was older, I described the room to my mother, and I drew where the bed was, where the window was, where the heating grate was, where the doctor was standing, and she said I was right. I know it would be, but that memory to me always seemed holy when I thought back on it, that memory of being born.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I remember being intensely curious the day I was born. I remember looking up at the doctors and thinking, "Who are these beings? Where am I? What is going on?" There was no context, though. There was no meaning.

I was just a clean slate, so I just looked upon these beings that were in the room with just love actually and awe and wonder like, "Oh, they're doing something for me that's so wonderful. Who are they? Why do I hurt? What is going on?" It was just very intense.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that's my earliest memory, and then I don't have very much memory until I was older. I remember this is a story I shared in the other video too, but I remember when I was about three or so, however old you are when you're still wearing a diaper and learning how to walk.

It's all about how you're being perceived.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another thing was, I always assumed that people in positions of power or authority were beings of great love and wisdom. So I assumed that if they were teaching at my school, they must be loving beings, and if they were the mayor of a city, that must be a really evolved being, and if they were the president of the United States, that person must be the most loving and wise person. That's not how it works on Earth. That's not how it is, especially at the moment. That's my opinion.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Return of Pre-Birth Memories" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Return_of_Pre-Birth_Memories"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Return of Pre-Birth Memories</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where memories of his pre-birth experience return later in life, bringing a deeper understanding of his spiritual nature and making earthly life feel less real in comparison." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_memories_of_his_pre-birth_experience_return_later_in_life,_bringing_a_deeper_understanding_of_his_spiritual_nature_and_making_earthly_life_feel_less_real_in_comparison."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where memories of his pre-birth experience return later in life, bringing a deeper understanding of his spiritual nature and making earthly life feel less real in comparison.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I was kind of dumbfounded and perplexed, and eventually, the memory left me like I said, and I didn't remember any of that. Then when it returned to me, I was just very surprised that it ever left. I was just like, "How did I ever forget that? It's the most natural thing in the world." In fact, the memory is like alive now. It's not like an Earth memory that happened kind of in the past and it's kind of blurry. No, it feels like it's right now, and it's super real, like super unreal, even more real than a physical event.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't know how to describe it, but it's not like an earthly memory. It's more like this confidence, this knowing in your true nature and what is real, whereas everything here feels like a black and white movie. It's not fake. It's a real black and white movie, but it's black and white. That's the best way I can put it.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When I say the memory feels real, it's like that is who we really are on the other side. This is like wearing a shirt or a spacesuit maybe. We're like looking out of the thick glass, and we're clunking around. This is not the norm for the being. This is an experience, and the experience is occurring within that which is still there. The spirit, the consciousness itself, is already there, already connected to all that is. It's just like a big illusion. It's not an illusion because it's real. This experience is real, but the content of the experience is not fundamental. It's a non-fundamental experience.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Purpose of the Human Experience" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Purpose_of_the_Human_Experience"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Purpose of the Human Experience</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Sundberg explains the deeper meaning behind incarnating, the opportunities for growth that Earth provides, and why souls willingly choose difficult experiences." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Sundberg_explains_the_deeper_meaning_behind_incarnating,_the_opportunities_for_growth_that_Earth_provides,_and_why_souls_willingly_choose_difficult_experiences."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Sundberg explains the deeper meaning behind incarnating, the opportunities for growth that Earth provides, and why souls willingly choose difficult experiences.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's kind of like a dream, like a very real dream. It's very intense, and because it's very intense, it has a very high opportunity for expansion, for growth. The further we can go, the more real, the more engaging it is, the greater the opportunity. Many spirits, I mean, everybody, I think that different spirits have different habits on how they approach incarnation, but many, from my understanding, try to do the hard things. They like doing it all at once, coming in and really getting their hands dirty because if they can do that, they know the incredible expansion and joy that is possible.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The guides may even remind them, "Hey, that might be too much. You might want to not lay off that much," and usually, it's the incarnating spirit that says, "No, I want to do that. I want it to be challenging." Well, here we are, and this place can be pretty challenging.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What do you think about most beings on this planet that are playing this game? Do you feel that most beings are given or have chosen to be here and to incarnate into a specific life, or do you feel like most of us are just here, and we're playing, we're fumbling around?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, I don't know because I only know what I went through, but I believe it's likely that the vast majority of people here specifically pick their life because I remember the incredible amount of detail that I reviewed this life beforehand with what could be like. For instance, I knew the details about my parents and who they were, not as names but as beings.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's like who you really are as the being. You're not really the character, so it's the being as the character, and I remember like the confidence my father would instill in me. I knew that would be very important for me because I knew that I would have to be confident, or else it would be almost impossible for me to meet this fear. I needed that confidence to get through the fear, and it would be a tool.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So that's, and then my father did raise me to be very confident. He always, if I may ask, what was the fear that you overcame?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and the process of overcoming it. So we like to put words on things, so we like to say the fear is like a fear of spiders or something like that. It's not quite that simple. The fear is a vibration, and if I had to describe it, it would be the inability to escape agony mixed with being too proud to suffer.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It took me a lot of years to finally get to that because we bury our fears underneath many layers, hundreds of layers of ego to protect us. When I first started going through counseling, I was going through EMDR, which is a form of therapy, and you'd go, you'd hit a layer, and you'd find something in yourself that was really scary, and like, "Oh, that's it. That's gotta be it. That's the root," and then you'd find another layer that's even deeper. "Oh, now that's gotta be it." It went on and on and on and on, and it was like I found it took me years to finally re-experience the most terrifying moment for me.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Role of Fear and Emotional Healing" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Role_of_Fear_and_Emotional_Healing"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Role of Fear and Emotional Healing</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he explores how deeply embedded fears shape the human experience and describes his process of uncovering and healing them through self-awareness and acceptance." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_explores_how_deeply_embedded_fears_shape_the_human_experience_and_describes_his_process_of_uncovering_and_healing_them_through_self-awareness_and_acceptance."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he explores how deeply embedded fears shape the human experience and describes his process of uncovering and healing them through self-awareness and acceptance.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was in a hospital in Chengdu, China, and I thought I was dying, and I experienced the same fear that I had had before, and it was just really hard to describe. It's a fear of being completely unable to escape pain and rejecting it because you're too proud. I don't know how to describe it, but it's something along those lines.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So the way for me has been, this is a huge topic that we could talk for hours about, but for me, one of the most important aspects of meeting this fear and healing is allowing it and allowing myself to feel. See, we reject things because we don't want to feel them. We're like, "I don't like feeling alone. I don't like feeling shameful. I don't like feeling powerless." Well, this is like the most powerless, like the most extreme, and I'm choosing to feel it, and when it comes, if it comes, and I have certain experiences that arise because of that, and that's okay.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When they come up, I'm willing. I'm choosing to be willing to allow reality to arrive to me how it will, and that's my own walk. I feel like everybody can benefit to some extent to allow reality to arrive to them as it will because reality is not your enemy.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In my specific case, it has to do with my feelings, my fears. I'm a very sensitive person, so I feel like I live in a world that is not really built for me. It's very like on a day-to-day basis, and I'm successful. I mean, I do all the things I need to do, and I have a human accomplishment, but it's very difficult for me.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I found that just allowing myself to experience whatever arrives, whatever feeling arrives, and not to fight it off but be of it and allow it to allow me to feel it because otherwise, you're going to bury it. If you bury it, it's still there. It's still down there, and then it causes problems, and that's what the ego does. The ego says, "No, I'm not powerless. I'm just gonna, I'm not powerless because look, I did this, and I did this, and I accomplished this, and look who I am."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">See, that's what no, that doesn't work. You may think that works, but it doesn't work. You feel how you feel, and if the thing is, the now moment is the one now moment. This one now is all the moments, so if in a now moment you experience some feeling, it's still there. So don't worry if it arrives into this now. Allow yourself to feel. No feeling will kill you.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No feeling will kill you, and even if your body would die someday, that's okay. You're gonna die. We're all gonna die. Our bodies are gonna pass. There's no such thing as death. It's just the biggest misunderstanding of this world. We're all running around trying to consume things and avoid thinking about our fears and avoid thinking about death, and we don't want to look, especially in the USA. We don't want to look at death too much. We just put it over here in a corner, and it's part of life. We're all going to pass.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, we're going to pass, and from there, we're going to let go of this life experience packet, as Tom would say, and move on to the next one. Exactly.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, exactly. So I like the point that you made earlier where you said it was necessary for you to forget and to come here in order for you to learn something or to experience trauma. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Why was it necessary?  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To speak to your question, I'm going to open something up on my computer. I'm going to have to step away. I actually have been working on a book for a number of years, and I'm getting close. I'm trying to answer these kinds of questions in a succinct way, not that I have all the answers. I don't, but I feel like people need to know.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Power of the Veil in Human Experience" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Power_of_the_Veil_in_Human_Experience"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Power of the Veil in Human Experience</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Sundberg explains how the veil allows for a fully immersive human experience, shaping personal identity and maintaining focus on the physical world." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Sundberg_explains_how_the_veil_allows_for_a_fully_immersive_human_experience,_shaping_personal_identity_and_maintaining_focus_on_the_physical_world."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Sundberg explains how the veil allows for a fully immersive human experience, shaping personal identity and maintaining focus on the physical world.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So as I look for that, I'll just say, when you know your true nature, there's nothing to fear. Now, it's not like you need something to fear. We don't need fear, but our true nature is beyond harm and without limitation. Our native being is powerful and unharmable.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So the veil allows us to focus on the physical experience all the way. It allows us to completely be this person, this character. If you didn't have the veil, you wouldn't be this character. You'd be the thing you already are that's connected to everything and is without limitation.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Imagine if you knew that you were connected to the sun.

So the first is, the veil allows us to have the very specialized experience of creaturehood and make choices from this very deep and convincing perspective, to make choices as if you're only this human personality, which is the very crux of what makes this experience so valuable. You have to do it from the perspective from here. Doing it from here is you having this experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If you didn't have the experience of being Vanessa, you wouldn't be Vanessa. You wouldn't have all the profound opportunity of experience that goes along with being Vanessa. So it's a little bit like saying, "Why do we have to be the person we are?" Well, because that's how it works.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Then number two, the veil allows us to focus on the physical, which is important because if we didn't have it, we'd get distracted because the higher realms are incredibly beautiful and fun and joyful and wonderful. So if you were constantly aware of that, it'd be very hard to stay focused and not get distracted in this experience.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Three, the veil protects us from painful homesickness. Okay, and I say that because the contrast is so great to be here as human that if you're like here and you know about there, it's super painful to be here because you miss there so much. That is actually why I'm very grateful that I don't have more memory like some of them every return, and I'm so glad it's so limited. I'm glad I only have a tiny little bit of memory come up because that tiny little bit of memory equals a lot of homesickness, and I am just so homesick.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Emotional Struggle of Separation" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Emotional_Struggle_of_Separation"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Emotional Struggle of Separation</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where he expresses the deep longing to return &quot;home,&quot; the challenge of existing in a lower vibrational state, and how memory limitations help prevent overwhelming homesickness." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_he_expresses_the_deep_longing_to_return_&quot;home,&quot;_the_challenge_of_existing_in_a_lower_vibrational_state,_and_how_memory_limitations_help_prevent_overwhelming_homesickness."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where he expresses the deep longing to return "home," the challenge of existing in a lower vibrational state, and how memory limitations help prevent overwhelming homesickness.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I want to go home. I don't even know where home is. I want to go home. I don't know where it is. I don't see it, but I know it's not here. Aaron's telling me this is my home, but it's not here.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, that's it. So imagine if you knew that tangibly on the tip of your, oh, it's like driving mad.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and we've both experienced it. It does drive me mad.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I'm sure.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And the fourth thing I'd say is, the veil allows you to have a clean slate each time because if you have past lives, they're not other people. They're you. You have done other things. It's kind of like, okay, this is a very rough metaphor that's just coming to mind, but let's say every day of the week, you went and did a different activity. You know, Monday you went rock climbing, Tuesday you went to the movies, Wednesday you went over to this restaurant, whatever. It's still you doing those experiences. It's not like a different person each day, even though you may feel very different when you're rock climbing than when you're watching the movies.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It's kind of like that. It's like you are still the you between experiences, but what happens is, in any given experience, especially in a physical reality like this where the constraints are so high, we do tend to get hung up in fear, and we tend to get snagged on certain associations. We associate with certain beliefs or requirements or whatever, the ego thing. We associate deeply with them, and many people go to their graves with some limiting idea that they're just really grabbing hold tight to.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The Value of a Fresh Start in Each Life" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Value_of_a_Fresh_Start_in_Each_Life"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Value of a Fresh Start in Each Life</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the veil resets identity in every incarnation, enabling new experiences without the burdens of past lives." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_veil_resets_identity_in_every_incarnation,_enabling_new_experiences_without_the_burdens_of_past_lives."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the veil resets identity in every incarnation, enabling new experiences without the burdens of past lives.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So one thing that the veil allows you to do is you start over. You have no history, no context when you come. You're a new person, a new free will awareness unit, as Tom Campbell's term. You've got no baggage. Exactly, no baggage. So that's another important reason because then you're able to just start completely fresh, and then it's a new growth opportunity.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then when you're finished, only not even when you're finished, I don't make a distinction between then and now because it's now. It's all now, but to the soul, the personality of this one person that you are is precious. So it's very additive to be this now, this person. It's just so valuable to the soul.

That's what's real.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So we have to constantly make choices, and we might not have to, but we have the opportunity to constantly make choices to better reflect that in this place because that thing that we are, that true nature that we are, is of love and freedom and joy and effortlessness and openness. It's not what we are. It's not a thing of stress and pain. This is not what it is.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So the more authentic we can be and the more genuine we can be about how we feel and how we relate to each other and about how we take care of those around us and how we meet our common moment, just the common simple moments, there's so much power in that.  </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Final Thoughts on Spiritual Growth and Love" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Final_Thoughts_on_Spiritual_Growth_and_Love"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Final Thoughts on Spiritual Growth and Love</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Sundberg reflects on embracing love, supporting each other, and recognizing the true nature of our existence beyond the earthly experience." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Sundberg_reflects_on_embracing_love,_supporting_each_other,_and_recognizing_the_true_nature_of_our_existence_beyond_the_earthly_experience."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Sundberg reflects on embracing love, supporting each other, and recognizing the true nature of our existence beyond the earthly experience.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I think on Earth, we tend to get so distracted about, "Oh, we've got these big problems.

We've got to make these changes. We've got to pay these bills. We've got to fix these systems. We've got to do all this. Okay, just meet yourself, meet your world, meet the person next to you the best you can. Water the plant.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and slow down. Right, slow down.

pre-birth experiences, the concept of being "veiled" upon entering the physical world, and how meditation can help reconnect with these memories.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">How important are our pre-birth experiences? Our pre-birth stories? So, when I was up until the age of like five, I had some pre-birth memory. It was there; it was normal. I assumed everybody knew we weren’t really from here. I took up a long-term meditation practice at the age of 30, and after a few months, began to have out-of-body experiences and had this rebirth memory return. And when I did that, I had the most holy moment of my whole life arrive to me. This is so beyond language, and I just have to say that about all this—like, there’s no language for any of this. I get it. But I felt my being expanded back out, and The Great I Am of all things—what we call God—and God said to me, “Are you ready to shine? Shine bright!”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Hi everyone, welcome back! I’m Michael Sandler, your host on Inspire Nation. If you’ve ever wondered why you came here and if you really chose to, then do we have the pre-birth experiences, a walk in the physical show for you today. I’ll be talking with Christian Sundberg, pre-birth experience expert and author of a brilliant book on the subject, <em>A Walk in the Physical</em>. And that’s just what I want to talk with him about today—about how and why we ended up here now, out-of-body experiences, and if we can all access our pre-birth memories. So, welcome to the show, Christian. And you are not a meat suit, but are you ready to shine?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, sir, very much so. I appreciate that intro that we recorded before the recording here—that you are not a meat suit. The show? Yes, indeed, we are not just the meat suit. So, since we are not—we’ve established this fact—we are not just our meat suit. How important are our pre-birth experiences or pre-birth stories?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, you know, it really depends on the individual. And you know, we come to be veiled, so it’s one of those things where we’re kind of here to play the human from the human perspective. So, it’s not always the case that I feel there’s this huge personal benefit to knowing the pre-birth plan fully. But we can, you know, when we let go enough of the form, the non-physical content is there. And I want to dive into pre-birth experiences, pre-birth stories, and how we can learn about them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But you said we came here to be veiled, and people talk about 3D, 5D—I joke, 7D—you know, all these different dimensions. The shift we’re going through—is this part of the evolution of consciousness? Do we need to always be veiled here in the earth school? Because it seems like kids are coming in more awake, more aware, and without forgetting.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That’s an excellent question. So, technically speaking, this level of density requires some level of veiling because of the nature of the density. However, as our vibration increases—that means as we process out old fear patterns and old form associations—it is natural, yes, of course, that as that vibration increases, we become increasingly familiar with who and what we really are. So, I love it that there are more coming in who have pre-birth awareness or, really, just that all of us are beginning to get more and more glimpses of who we really are in various forms—out-of-body experiences or other types of experiences. It’s becoming increasingly normal. That’s because the vibration of the human collective consciousness is changing; it’s increasing.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Exploring Out-of-Body Experiences**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Exploring_Out-of-Body_Experiences**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Exploring Out-of-Body Experiences</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian shares his personal out-of-body experiences, describing the vividness and richness of non-physical environments." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_shares_his_personal_out-of-body_experiences,_describing_the_vividness_and_richness_of_non-physical_environments."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian shares his personal out-of-body experiences, describing the vividness and richness of non-physical environments.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Have you had personally out-of-body experiences? Yes, sir, yes. What have they been like? What can you tell us about it? And then we’ll get to the pre-birth stories, but it’s something that’s really fascinating for people today.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, so, okay, it’s really difficult to describe at times because we tend to think of reality in terms of physical environments. And our larger nature is much bigger than that. But there are so—I have had experiences of environments that are far more rich and lucid and real than anything on Earth. The colors are like a thousand times or more rich and real and alive, and you can feel that they’re a part of you. And you can—oh my gosh, how do you describe this? I mean, without making it sound too crazy, but even just looking at one blade of grass—you know, I remember in one out-of-body experience, looking at this blade of grass in this beautiful heavenly environment and being like, “Oh my gosh, like, I could spend all day just looking at this blade of grass, and I would feel fulfilled.” That’s how beautiful and how full of life even one blade of grass is. So, yes, they’re very real.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, it’s interesting. After my first near-death experience, I saw light in a different way and became a photographer for many years. I had photos in older Colorado art galleries and all sorts of different places. And it started by looking at a blade of grass in the morning and seeing dew on it and seeing the fractal reflection of all of the different colors. And I just started to cry looking at the blade of grass.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, that’s how, as we see reality with alertness and presence, it’s not even about the size. It’s just that the beauty of spirit shines through because of alertness and presence. And so, even a blade of grass can—yeah, of course, it can be truly moving. Anything, actually, when met with full presence, alertness, non-resistance, and openness, we will experience that because we have shifted.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, that’s fascinating. I again want to get to your pre-birth story, and at the same time, without resistance. So, I told you that I’m having this show tonight about the supposed drones in New Jersey and everything going on. It seems like we’re birthed into or brought into or indoctrinated—maybe that’s the word—into a world that gives us resistance so that we can’t see beyond the wall or see beyond the veil to see the other side because we’re so busy in this struggle or fear-based state.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, yeah. Fear is a very low vibration, and when we associate into fear—and even when we simply deeply form-associate in general—that means when we deeply associate with thoughts or sensory experience or bodily experience, that is very, naturally, obscuring. It’s like staring at the movie screen instead of being aware that you’re in the theater at the movie theater, you know? So, it’s not—yeah, it’s just the nature of staring hard at the movie screen is that you won’t be aware that you’re in the seat. Or staring hard at the meat suit or thinking that you’re the meat suit—yes. And it’s very convincing, you know. Like, I’m not making light of how incredibly rich and dense and consistent and persistent the physical simulation is. It’s very real; it’s just not the most fundamentally real thing.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**The Nature of Reality and Consciousness**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**The_Nature_of_Reality_and_Consciousness**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>The Nature of Reality and Consciousness</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian explains the concept of reality as a simulation, distinguishing between the physical world and the fundamental reality of consciousness." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_explains_the_concept_of_reality_as_a_simulation,_distinguishing_between_the_physical_world_and_the_fundamental_reality_of_consciousness."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian explains the concept of reality as a simulation, distinguishing between the physical world and the fundamental reality of consciousness.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What do you mean then by a simulation? So, that which is fundamentally real, okay, is consciousness itself or spirit itself. And that stuff which can’t actually be named, okay, but you know, the closest words we have for that is—it’s life itself, and it is of love and peace and joy and freedom and fullness. And then form—the experience of objects and thoughts and stories and bodies, meat suits—arises on and in that consciousness. The form is happening on and in the movie screen, you could say, of consciousness. And so, the reality is the movie screen, not the form. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The form is just something that’s been lifted up for us to experience, to deeply, apparently, lose ourselves in for a while. But it is just, you know, simulation in the sense it’s not fundamentally real. It’s just something that we’ve engaged in. It’s kind of like a dream at night. When you wake up in the morning, you don’t need someone to tell you, “Oh, that was just a dream.” You just—it’s obvious. It’s quite self-evident that, “Oh, that was just a dream. Now, this is the reality.” That’s kind of how this reality is when we awake post-life. It’s like, “Oh, of course, that was not the fundamentally real thing. That was just a really neat, deep experience I just had.” So, uh, banging the Ford pickup truck into the rocket ship last night may not have happened.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, you know, we are doing something. There’s an experience happening here. It’s just that it’s important that we keep in perspective what’s fundamentally real versus the content of the video game, so to speak. So, can you take us—all joking aside, and I just feel this levity with you, Christian—can you take us to—is it that you remembered your pre-birth experience in the early years and then it faded and then it came back? Can you take us through this arc?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Recalling the Pre-Birth Plan**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Recalling_the_Pre-Birth_Plan**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Recalling the Pre-Birth Plan</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian recounts his pre-birth memories, including the moment he accepted the veil for his current life." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_Christian_recounts_his_pre-birth_memories,_including_the_moment_he_accepted_the_veil_for_his_current_life."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where Christian recounts his pre-birth memories, including the moment he accepted the veil for his current life.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sure, yeah. And I did share some, and we had a wonderful conversation last time about a year ago, and I remember sharing some of this as well. So, I’ll try not to be redundant, but, um, so when I was up until the age of like five years old, I had some pre-birth memory. It was just there; it was normal. I assumed everybody knew we weren’t really from here, you know, we’re just visiting. But then that memory left me by the age of five or six, and I had no memory of that at all until the age of 30. And my body is 44 years old right now. I took up a long-term meditation practice at the age of 30, and after a few months, um, began to have out-of-body experiences and had this pre-birth memory return. And it was just so normal and natural. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, then I didn’t talk about it for like eight years because I’m a working professional. That’s the kind of thing you don’t share. But, um, I’m so glad that, you know, eventually I felt the ground was fertile enough to share it, and I did. I shared it about six years ago, and now I, you know, I’m just so passionate about sharing this—not because it’s my story; it has nothing to do with me, actually. It’s about what we are. You know, you and I were talking before we started recording about like the most important message—reminding people of who we really are, what we really are. Absolutely. Like, I feel that in my bones. Like, I am so passionate about lifting up to people: We are multi-dimensional beings of love and joy, and there is nothing to fear. Like, the end. Like, we can flesh it out really. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I mean, we can flesh it out in so many ways, but it is the true—it is true that we are multi-dimensional beings of love, and we have nothing to fear. And that is what I really want to lift up to people because if we really know that, we become so empowered to live this life in a way that is joyful and free and loved and loving, you know, rather than, um, fear-focused and painful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Going back—thank you—going back to your pre-birth experience, what do you remember of it? What were you told or taught? And, um, were you given a plan or mission that you recall?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, so I won’t share the whole thing for the sake of time, but I remember being inspired by a being who had incarnated to take up incarnation myself because I could see the quality of his essence and what he was like—who he had become through the process of integrating something this dense and this deep. And then, um, I had had many physical experiences—um, most of my pre-birth memories of a time immediately preceding this life, actually the one right before this one as well. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I remember for that life accepting the veil, um, and the intention of that life was primarily to face and process a very deep, low-vibration fear that had bested me in a previous experience. I remember accepting the veil for that life, which I’ve described in many different, um, you know, talks, but basically, it was like a plummet in the vibration of my being that was so incredibly deep and jarring and, like, low, low, low, low, low, low—like, so low, so low. And then when you’re—I’m at the bottom, keep going lower—like, the vibrational difference between there and here is like ludicrous. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then, and then after arriving—and, by the way, that plummet of vibration is not just a vibrational plummet; it’s like an erasing. It feels like, you know, of all that you are—like, an erasing of memory almost, or an obscuring, an obscuring of memory and access to knowledge. And in that lifetime, I reacted out of fear. I was like, “I’m not doing this. This is not happening. There’s no way I’m going to live a whole lifetime in this dense, dark place. No, no, no.” </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, I summoned my might, and I smote the veil, caused a miscarriage for that experience because of my fighting my way back out. And I had a life review for that experience, and I saw that my fear had heaped grief upon the mother because she had lost the baby. And that by affecting the mother in that way, I had actually made hundreds of other people’s journeys more difficult. I could see like ripples in the pond.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I still had this intention to process this fear, and they brought me this life. And I reviewed this life in incredible detail. It was like if you took a tree and laid it on its side, I reviewed millions and millions of possibilities—like, going from the trunk out to the branches of all the potentiality of what this life might be. And I reviewed it all in like a second. It wasn’t hard. I had, you know, there’s incredibly wide bandwidth in spirit, and I reviewed the whole thing—like, what it would be like to be me, me. And I made certain requests for the life—I asked about certain qualities, and the guides helped me work with it. And then, eventually, I remember the moment where I accepted the veil for this life once again as a plummeting in vibration down and having all my knowing cut off. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And, um, this time, trying not to fight it, basically. And when I arrived at the place of being in the womb, I remember once again I was like, “I’m not doing this. Like, I’m not doing this. This is too dark. I’m not doing this.” And so, once again, I began to summon my might to fight the way out again. And when I did that, I had the most holy moment of my whole life arrive to me. It felt—this is so beyond language, and I just have to say that about all this—like, there’s no language for any of this. I get it. But I felt my being expanded back out, and The Great I Am of all things—what we call God—came to me and showed me all that I am and all that we are. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I felt the bliss of our being, and I felt our son—the son of Earth—and it was like churning with bliss. It was alive; it had a consciousness to it. And I know that sounds wild, but I felt it in me. I could see it; I could feel it. And God said to me, “This is still what you are. You can never not be this.” And that is like the most holy, personal moment in my lifetime because I was like, “Oh, I haven’t lost all that I am.” You know, I stopped fighting, and I, you know, I surrendered back into being in the womb.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you. Can you say what God said one more time because that is the everything right there? “You can never not be this. You can never not be what you are.” Like, what you truly are, you know? Like, so, basically, because I—for I had—I was reacting in fear because I thought I had lost all that I really am. That that was what this veiling meant. And I know that I’ve lived many times. I don’t really know why this veiling was so specifically hard or challenging for me, but it was. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that message to me was like, “You can never lose what you really are.” And that is true of all of us. And that is what I’m so passionate about sharing—like, we cannot lose who we really are, even though we get really, really, really deeply engaged in the game here on Earth. We get deep; we’re veiled, right? And we get really lost in the story and the fear, maybe. But even, even so, you can’t lose who you really are. I mean, it’s not just about me.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Evolution of Humanity" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Evolution_of_Humanity"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Evolution of Humanity</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the text discusses the evolution and ascension of humanity, exploring the idea that current challenges are part of a larger shift in consciousness." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_text_discusses_the_evolution_and_ascension_of_humanity,_exploring_the_idea_that_current_challenges_are_part_of_a_larger_shift_in_consciousness."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the text discusses the evolution and ascension of humanity, exploring the idea that current challenges are part of a larger shift in consciousness.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, what if humanity, as most teachers say, that we are shifting, we are changing in dimensionality or density or whatever label we want to give it—we are evolving, ascending, changing. What if this was so hard this lifetime for you because that was important—the most important experience for you to have—for you to play your role in helping this greater ascension of consciousness?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, that might be, but I won’t conjecture on that. Yeah, well, I would say if everything happens for a reason, if everything is God and nothing is not, um, and if there is such a thing as divine timing, then it had to happen right here, right now for this particular lifetime, which seems to me is an accelerator toward a cliff of change, toward a singularity—whatever we want to call that—to a moment of, we are either going to or not going to. And so, we call in these experiences at this particular time, and we call ourselves here at this particular time to help with this process.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sure, yeah. And one way to think about this actually is, um, I’m sensing in this moment as you described that we might make the mistake of thinking there’s us down here and then there’s that over there, and they’re two different things, and that over there is trying to like do this hard thing. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We’re actually all one. So, it’s actually other aspects of ourselves, really, you know, other brothers and sisters that are part of ourselves that are helping us to fulfill the incredible potential that this level of contrast offers—like, to actually integrate this, to actually shine love through it, and to actually process out all the fear. Like, that is an incredible action, you could say, that’s bigger than even one lifetime and bigger than any one person. So, yes, indeed, our spirit friends on the other side—we call it the other side in consciousness—are helping, of course. They’re part of that process.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so, yeah, and then I’m with you on the other side because the other side is here. The other side is everywhere. Um, there’s—there’s a—I may not even be able to finish the thought train on this, but I’m going to bring you the thought train and see where you take it. So, you talked about a previous lifetime being in incredibly low density, uh, incredibly low vibration, shall we say. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I was thinking of advanced meditators who’ve been, you know, gone through PET scans or different brain scans, and what they find is they may have both a low vibration and like a gamma—an off-the-charts vibration. And now, like, it’s becoming, I think, a hyper-gamma or something even higher than that. And it brings me to the thought of music, which is, if we judge a note, we lose the big picture. If we realize that many notes can be played simultaneously, you see where I’m going with this?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No, absolutely. It is like that. Um, the symphony. So, the way I put it is, contrast is useful. The depths of duality—the depths of duality are a creative offering. They’re not something to be opposed. They’re a part of the unfolding—the great unfolding, which is, you know, this—the symphony of all that is growing, the expansiveness of consciousness through the integration of experience. So, yeah, I love that. That’s beautiful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and to me, if we awaken more to it rather than judging—okay, I’m having in this moment, in this lifetime, what appears to be a lower vibration moment, but maybe this is just actually the low note that, when I combine it by awakening to who and what I am and play a higher note at the same time—or even mix and match and dare to lean into the low note—oh, yes, absolutely. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, the substance that is actually fundamentally real is non-dual, and that non-dual nature is of love, peace, freedom, and joy already, okay? So, then, we don’t need to fear the depths of duality that have arisen within it because they are actually in service to it. They’re not actually opposed, you know? Now, the ego doesn’t like that, you know, because fear is about rejection; it’s about opposition. Fear says, “No, no, no, I’m a victim. Don’t you tell me otherwise.” Or, “No, no, no, this person next to me is my enemy. Don’t you tell me otherwise.” </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That’s just what the ego does. It’s okay. But at the deepest level, there is no enemy. Like, there’s no adversary. Life is not our enemy. The physical reality is not our enemy. So, yes, we absolutely can lean into the low notes, as I love how you put that. When those low notes arise, it’s okay. Don’t judge yourself. Like, just actually say, “Oh, see that? Wow, like, this is just a profound depth of contrast that is being offered to me.” The question isn’t whether or not it’s arisen; it’s what you do with it, you see?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Understanding Death" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Understanding_Death"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Understanding Death</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the nature of death is explored, presenting it as a release from physical limitations rather than something to be feared." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_nature_of_death_is_explored,_presenting_it_as_a_release_from_physical_limitations_rather_than_something_to_be_feared."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the nature of death is explored, presenting it as a release from physical limitations rather than something to be feared.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, death—since we’re talking about not fear and leaning into all that—where do we get lost on death? And is it something to fear? Death is absolutely not something to fear. There actually isn’t something called death. Um, it just looks like that in the physical, you know, because a body stops working. Death is simply the physical end of a physical journey wherein the limitations that we were wearing are dropped. So, it’s like taking off a tight shirt or an astronaut’s space suit or something, you know, and returning with fullness to who we really are. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, it is not an end. It is absolutely a beautiful, beautiful release. The harder thing is actually the other way—the coming in, incarnating. You can say birth—you can say birth is like the death because here is the state where we have adopted, temporarily, a very intense and dense and, you know, constraining set of limitations in consciousness—that is, the limitations of the body and the physics of the physical reality that we’re engaging. You know, that wearing that is hard. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is like the more dead state, actually. So, physical death is—oh my gosh, it’s nothing to be feared. It is the release of those constraints, and it is a wonderful, um, a wonderful transition. It’s very normal, like, you know, we tend to kind of, I think, um, you know, make death this grand, terrifying thing in our minds. It is very normal. It’s just like waking up in the morning. It’s just what we do. It’s fine.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Incarnation Cycles" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Incarnation_Cycles"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Incarnation Cycles</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the concept of incarnation cycles is discussed, exploring the idea that individuals choose their experiences and have the freedom to end the cycle." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_concept_of_incarnation_cycles_is_discussed,_exploring_the_idea_that_individuals_choose_their_experiences_and_have_the_freedom_to_end_the_cycle."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the concept of incarnation cycles is discussed, exploring the idea that individuals choose their experiences and have the freedom to end the cycle.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, how are we, as multi-dimensional beings, having these pre-birth experiences? And they’re here to serve us. Are we having an—I like to use the term infinitude—are we having infinitude, meaning lifetime after lifetime of different lives? Is there an end to that? Can we choose to end that? What does that look like?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so, um, I would—I feel that there is eventually an end to an incarnation cycle. Um, you know, metaphorically, you wouldn’t go to school infinitely, you know. There’s not really a reason to do that. We do get to choose. You know, we are free-willed, sovereign beings. We get to choose: Would I like to experience something else? Would I like to entertain a new perspective and integrate a new experience? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Would I like to deepen myself in a new way again? Now, we may do that many times because we see—we know the tangible, amazing, tasty deepening of being that is possible through physical experience integration. But it’s always our choice. Yeah, and eventually, actually, I feel there does reach a point where we say, “You know, I don’t think I’m going to continue with this school,” so to speak. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, “I don’t really need that because, ultimately, form doesn’t actually hold the answer. It’s not ultimately like the truly satisfying thing.” You know, we already have that. It’s already the oneness of being. It’s already what we truly are. So, it’s quite natural eventually to say, “No, I don’t think I’m going to go play another game.” You know, it’s just like video games. Like, you can play a bunch of video games, and eventually, they lose their luster, and you might say, “Yeah, I think I’m not going to do that anymore.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It’s—when I was trying to make it to the Tour de France, I was hit by a car racing in France, and I was given a little—I don’t know—Game Boy, Nintendo, something in the hospital there where they only spoke French to me, and I didn’t speak much French. It was a very interesting experience, but I beat Tetris, and I got to watch the little space shuttle take off in this little game. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then I didn’t want to play it anymore. It’s like, “All right, I won. Now what?” And now you know how to play Tetris. Yes, and you get to keep that. And you get to keep that. Yeah, that you don’t have to play. Yes, yes. And it’s a part of something that you may have very much enjoyed, and you may play again if you like. It’s kind of like that with physical incarnations.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Sensitivity as a Superpower" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Sensitivity_as_a_Superpower"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Sensitivity as a Superpower</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the challenges and strengths of being highly sensitive are discussed, framing sensitivity as a powerful tool for personal growth and service to the collective." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_challenges_and_strengths_of_being_highly_sensitive_are_discussed,_framing_sensitivity_as_a_powerful_tool_for_personal_growth_and_service_to_the_collective."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the challenges and strengths of being highly sensitive are discussed, framing sensitivity as a powerful tool for personal growth and service to the collective.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, what about sensitive folk and Tetris?

I mean, um, I very much understand that. I’m an extremely sensitive person. I have sensitivities that it seems that no other humans around me experience. It makes day-to-day existence very challenging at times. Okay, but the thing is—okay, there is a superpower within sensitivity because what we’ve done is—it is a brave soul, a mighty and proficient being, okay, who will dive so deeply into the physical so as to really experience it very deeply because, in that depth of experience, even more is possible—more personal growth, more healing, and more service, actually, to the collective as well—the whole. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, it’s actually an amazing power to be very sensitive here. There are different levels of engagement in the physical, you know. It’s not like every human is having the same experience. Some are having a much less, um, deep and sensitive experience. It might be more kind of rote or, you know, non-super alert, you know—sometimes ignorance is bliss kind of thing where it’s less challenging if there’s, you know, if it’s kind of automatic. Whereas there is something of a great challenge in very deeply engaging the physical and then seeing how we can do even that. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But there’s so much power in it. So, I’m glad you asked that question because I feel like, you know, a lot of people who may resonate with your message and certainly people who’ve reached out to me are very sensitive people—you know, very empathic, spiritually aware people. And, you know, I understand it’s the sensitive folks who kind of feel the most trampled at times, but man, it’s also such a power. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And if we can use that sensitivity to actually feel on the spirit and to really process the physical that deeply and to really let go of the physical that deeply, wow, the amount of, um, energy—spiritual energy—and potency that can rise up and be there with us and through us is amazing.

Would you mind sharing about—and then I want to go into if we can—how we can, um, see our own pre-birth experiences. What are some of the sensitivities that you’ve been challenged with, and how have you worked with that?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, wow, that’s a big question. I’ll keep it simple because it’s—I could go on for an hour about that, but I’m sensitive to all substances—foods, all drugs, all smells. I’m sensitive to light. I can’t use any computer monitors that have been made in the last 10 years because they flicker very quickly at the pixel level—temporal dithering is what it’s called. It took me years to figure out what the problem was. The headlights on my car—I can’t drive my car at night because if they flicker at 180 hertz—I measured it—and it just causes me pain like instantly. Um, I’m sensitive to people’s energies. I’m sensitive to, um, qualities of energy that may not even be related to people. So, it’s a very rich—I mean, so, like, places or, um, intentionality behind things—like, a book. The author has a certain energy, and that energy carries into the book. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Things like that that you wouldn’t even—that you wouldn’t even—I pick up a book, I don’t need—yesterday, we were gifted a book, and I said, “Here, let me feel that for a minute.” Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, so I feel like that. Like, and there’s certain authors where I feel the energy of their words, and I’m like, “Oh my goodness, that’s beautiful.” Like, Seth from <em>Seth Speaks</em>—I love the energy of Seth. Very different energy, but I love the energy of Silver Birch, channeled by Maurice Barbanell in the 1930s in the UK. That’s a channeled book—not many people know about it—amazing work. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The energy there is—oh, it’s amazing. So, anyway, so I tend to feel that everywhere. And if I eat one thing that my body doesn’t resonate with, like, it can affect me for days, you know? Um, I’ve also experienced many health challenges throughout my life—chronic health challenges. I won’t go into many of them, but, like, you know, just as some quick examples, I’ve experienced biochemical ups and downs—you know, people can call that like a form of bipolar or something—but I’ve had depression moments that are so painful, you know? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I understand it has to do with the processing of all these deep experiences I’ve had and the sensitivity I’ve experienced. Um, chronic fatigue, I’ve experienced. Epstein-Barr, migraine headaches. I had a spontaneous lung collapse when I was 26, and I was in a hospital for 10 days. I have connective tissue issues. Like, I’ve experienced many things that, like, are just not typical, you know, typical sensitivities in the body. Anyway, so I won’t go on at length about it, but it’s fascinating because I’m on my own journey right now, particularly with an often swollen belly right now where I keep pulling things out of the diet. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then, on occasion, I’ll notice, um, an errant, in-quote thought will occur, and all of a sudden, the belly is swollen, and I’m going, “I didn’t even eat air right now.” It’s a sensitivity, like you’re saying, on levels to energy. So, what have you done? What is your process besides stripping away? How have you been able to work with this?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, there are two things that come to mind that I want to lift up, and the first one you may not think is directly related, but truly it is. So, the body—there was a long time when I resisted the body. I resisted the pains, the chronic illness, all the difficulty. But I found that the body is actually an amazingly faithful soundboard for experience integration itself. You know, we’re here to have a physical, bodily experience. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, the body and its responses to things is like a beautiful invitation to listen to it, to work with it, and to actually follow intuition for what the body is actually asking for because it may not be what the mainstream says, okay? So, then, the other thing I would lift up is actually meditation because, as we become more familiar with what we really are—awareness itself, consciousness itself—versus the form, the thought, the sensations, you know, we develop this precious ledge to stand on—this like space of power and peace that life, with a capital L, rises up through in consciousness into the body, actually, and it strengthens us. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What it reminds me of is actually—I don’t know if you’ve heard of breatharianism—you know, there are actually some individuals who physically don’t eat. You know, they did a documentary on this, and they—one guy, they tested him in the hospital for an extended duration. He doesn’t eat or drink. These, you know, some—it’s not common, but there are some people who apparently do not eat or drink. I know that sounds wild, but they sustain themselves through that direct energetic connection because that is—yeah, prana—because that is the true source of strength. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I’m lifting that up because what sensitive people, especially if we can get in touch with that, we tend to really become vibrant from it and with it. You know, it’s almost like we’re built to receive it and to experience that in consciousness rather than trying to find the next physical thing to scratch the itch, you know—the next drink or the next whatever. Like, no, this is about like a purity of energy that can actually empower the body.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, thank you. Let’s go from there. Can we consciously become aware of our pre-birth experiences? And if so, how do we do that?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Accessing Pre-Birth Experiences" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Accessing_Pre-Birth_Experiences"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Accessing Pre-Birth Experiences</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the possibility of accessing pre-birth experiences through meditation is discussed, emphasizing the importance of letting go of expectations." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_possibility_of_accessing_pre-birth_experiences_through_meditation_is_discussed,_emphasizing_the_importance_of_letting_go_of_expectations."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the possibility of accessing pre-birth experiences through meditation is discussed, emphasizing the importance of letting go of expectations.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, well, it is always technically possible, and I can’t speak for any individual person, but I’ll at least say that meditation is really helpful because, as we grow in familiarity with what we really are, the larger parts of ourselves tend to just be there. They tend to rise up on their own, and that may include pre-birth awareness. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, it’s okay if it doesn’t. In fact, when we go into the long-term meditation practice, it’s—I find it’s best to arrive with no expectations, zero goals, other than alert awareness and other than objective investigation of, “What am I? What is consciousness beneath thought?” And that doesn’t have a goal; it doesn’t have an outcome to it. But as we do that and as we—it’s kind of backwards—as we let go of everything and even expectation, it tends to be that, yes, the larger parts of ourselves will rise up on their own. So, it is possible to see that. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, for some, it won’t be beneficial necessarily to know at the human level what’s been planned, but on the other hand, there’s not like a true rule or something. It’s just that—see, we adopted the veil and the limitations, but we’re allowed to do whatever we would like through it and with it. We are completely free, creative, powerful beings. So, we’re allowed to do what we like with it and see, “Whoa, what can I do from within the veiled experience?”</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Soul Contracts and Karma" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Soul_Contracts_and_Karma"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Soul Contracts and Karma</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the concepts of soul contracts and karma are explored, explaining them as agreements and energetic cause and effect, rather than punishment." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_concepts_of_soul_contracts_and_karma_are_explored,_explaining_them_as_agreements_and_energetic_cause_and_effect,_rather_than_punishment."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the concepts of soul contracts and karma are explored, explaining them as agreements and energetic cause and effect, rather than punishment.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so that brings up the question of soul contracts and karma and things of this sort. Where does that fit in?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, there are two different questions I feel. Soul contracts just mean, you know, what is the deep soul-level agreement that you signed up for pre-life? And in my case, it was to process this very specific fear, and my life was kind of built around this theme. But of course, it’s not just one thing. There’s also many things that can occur in a life—a lot of potential, a lot of experience integration that’s possible. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When it comes to karma, now, karma is just another word for cause and effect, but not just physical cause and effect—energetic cause and effect. Another way to put that is basically, you are who you are. So, who you are, you carry with you from one life to the next. You’re not different people. I mean, you may experience the perspective of being different people, but it’s still you. It’s still you. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, if you are a person who has fear and has ego and has historically responded—perhaps, let’s say, you have a fear of powerlessness, so you respond in anger because anger seems to give you this power. It’s just like this fake thing. Maybe that’s been a pattern. Well, then, that’s just who you are. You just are the being that has had that pattern and experiences that level of fear. So, it’s not that karma is a punishment; it’s more like we are naturally guided into who we really are so that we can process out that which is yet unhealed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Can you repeat that one more time for us?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Healing and Growth" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Healing_and_Growth"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Healing and Growth</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the process of healing and growth is discussed, emphasizing the importance of facing and integrating fear and other challenges." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_process_of_healing_and_growth_is_discussed,_emphasizing_the_importance_of_facing_and_integrating_fear_and_other_challenges."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the process of healing and growth is discussed, emphasizing the importance of facing and integrating fear and other challenges.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so, we tend to be guided into situations, experiences, contexts that help us to see who we really are so that, if there’s something that’s unhealed, we have the opportunity to heal it. So, for example, you know, people might ask about, like, lower-vibration astral realms where there’s some lot of negative, gunky stuff happening. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, if you’re someone who resonates into that gunk for some reason, it may be useful for you to experience that gunk because you’re choosing it, actually. You may not be aware of it, but if you choose the gunk, then you’re going to see the gunk until you actually experientially learn—not just intellectually learn—but experientially learn, “Oh, that’s not optimal,” and you process out whatever fear gave rise to that pattern. It gives you the opportunity to process the fear, ultimately.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, then, if we go big picture—still Earth, but big picture—are we all as one collective, one collective consciousness, choosing to see the gunk? And is it to see the gunk to heal the gunk, to bring it up? Why are we in a gunk-aided world, apparently gunk-aided world, right now?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, we’re in a gunk-aided world because the limitations are extreme, and we have not yet fully evolved enough to integrate the fear that has arisen in response to those limitations. And I’m just using the word fear, but fear in this comment means all of the ego shenanigans that arise out of fear—selfishness, hatred, anger, you know, all this us-versus-them thinking, all these beliefs—actually, belief itself is often a tool of the ego, you know. All these patterns that the human race has kind of enshrined for thousands of years as a response to fear. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As we evolve, we tend to face that root crap directly and process it and integrate it. But it can’t be faced unless it’s seen. So, often, we manifest it, whether consciously or unconsciously, so that we can see the insanity of fear and process our way past it and heal. And we do that, uh, well, we do it collectively, but it’s done at the individual level. So, it’s really important to not feel powerless in this. In fact, if even one person really, truly processes their crap—you know, owns their crap, faces their fear, and really chooses more often authenticity and love and peace and joy in their lives in a small way, it does have a huge vibrational impact for the entire collective consciousness. So, we are actually each very much empowered to help the awakening of the whole.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Love it. What is one way that we can face and turn—since we’re going there today—turn and face our crap?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Facing Fear and Embracing Love**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Facing_Fear_and_Embracing_Love**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Facing Fear and Embracing Love</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian provides practical advice on how to face and process fear, emphasizing the importance of accepting and feeling negative emotions.

He discusses how love and service are the ultimate spiritual powers that can transform both individuals and the collective.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so, um, be willing to see what’s actually there. That sounds simple, but it’s not. The ego loves covering things up—hundreds of layers. Be willing to actually see what’s there. And then, when you see it, that is when you feel the negative feeling in your body, or you see the pattern in your past, or you see how you were abused and how that wounded you—whatever that negative gunk is—then face it and feel it and accept it. Accepting it doesn’t mean, “Oh, I really hate you, but I’m going to push you away.” No, it means, “Wow, I feel wounded.” Acknowledging it 100%, feeling 100%. Let—if you want to, if you need to cry, let yourself cry. If you need to go take a nap, go do it. I’m just saying, be so allowing that you actually accept and feel what is actually in there. And that’s like a way of saying yes to life. So, saying yes to life means even saying yes to the darkness that you may have historically been churning so that you can process past it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, cool. Thank you. So, all right, we’ve—I’m going to say all of us, but most of us—have had the experience where we’ve met somebody, maybe we’ve fallen in love with somebody, looked into their eyes, and, like, and then it is such an instant connection, and it didn’t work out, and we’re going, “Well, wait a second, if I have such a recognition of this person, why didn’t it work out?” Are these people that we knew before? Are they part of our soul family?

It doesn’t have to be an attractive person or someone that’s just your soulmate because we are all a part of the one ocean. So, that unity of being is beautiful. It is like we are individuated, but we are simultaneously one with the whole and with each other. And so, when we see another, it is a recognition of the other as being a part of yourself. And that connectedness is kind of—it’s actually what we all yearn for on Earth because Earth is one of the things that makes Earth so crazy unique is the incredible degree of separation. Like, we feel separate here. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It’s crazy how separate we feel. So, if we even get a glimmer of connectedness, we tend to like, “Oh, wow, we want to grab right on to that.” You know, now, it might fail, you know, because we get really deeply form-associated, which means both our own fear-based responses—ego—and how we treat our relationships, but also because we tend to associate then into form only—you know, maybe a body or an activity or a, you know, something. But the thing is, connectedness is about a quality of intention, not a form. It’s about love first. It’s about vulnerability, openness, you know. When we’re in that state of vulnerability, openness, and realness, then that connection rises up because we’ve stopped putting up a boundary, you see? So, I don’t know if that speaks to your question.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It speaks a little bit. I am curious, though, on an individual level, are there souls—are there sparks from the other side, souls that we see, meet, or know on the other side that then we recognize here on Earth?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Absolutely, yeah. We do know each other in much broader form on the other side. So, we have many relationships; we just don’t remember on Earth. It’s quite normal, and we have a lot of love. Love is the name of the game. So, yeah, absolutely, we could have relationships with those who we have known before that we already have relationship with here on Earth and recognize them, absolutely.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, have you spent much time consciously on the other side?

It’s like, you in Minecraft, you just ask me, “So, what is Earth like? Tell me about the blocks.” You know, well, Earth is so much bigger than little eight-bit blocks in a Minecraft game. There’s so many activities. A Minecraft character couldn’t even imagine. So, it’s kind of like that when we start talking about the other side. We’re talking about a hugely, hugely deep, rich, vast, complex multiverse, you know? So, there are so many opportunities and different types of experience—even just thought-responsive realities where we might take with us certain form associations that we either are just kind of lost within or that we just enjoy. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We might create, manifest, so there are Earth-looking reality systems just because that’s what we like—trees, so there’s trees, you know, that beautiful Florida background, which is live, by the way, for anybody who’s wondering. When we first started recording, I thought maybe it was my editor told me today, “Shut off the background noise suppression so people can hear it.” But, but, but I gotta be honest, Christian, there are people blasting music—I can only hear it a little bit—but blasting music on the other side of the waterway here, and if YouTube actually picks up what that sound is, it’ll pan it, saying, “You’re playing music without permission.” </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, the boats—the boats go by silently at the moment. They actually have a noise. The birds and squirrels have a noise, too. Anyway, so, yeah, so I don’t know if I answered your question about the other side, but it’s really, really difficult to describe from here where we have a super crude, limited set of metaphors. I can simply say it’s a multiverse of possible experience which is so rich and real and varied that it’s quite difficult to describe. Now, I’m still veiled very much, you know. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Out-of-body experiences happen, but it’s, you know, it’s not like every day or something for me, though it is relatively common, but, um, at least in small measure, you know.

Like, at first, when I started having out-of-body experiences, it was like, “Well, that’s all I wanted to go do now because it’s so beautiful and rich and fun.” Like, the fun is off the charts. So, but I’m here to be the human character right now. I, you know, that’s what I’m here to do.

Like, I love games, and there’s like a tabletop game. I paint these little models, and I go to the store and play with other people who’ve painted their models. I love that. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, it’s just as simple. It’s physical. We roll dice, you know. It’s—I feel spiritual in that because it’s something that I enjoy actually pursuing. What we enjoy is a part of what we’re here to do, actually—just to enjoy the playground of the physical in whatever way it calls to us. That is an alignment with our true nature because our true nature is joy and passion and fun and freedom. So, yeah, doing what is available in the physical with that spirit is powerful. It’s really good to do.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Integration of Spiritual and Physical" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Integration_of_Spiritual_and_Physical"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Integration of Spiritual and Physical</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the integration of spiritual experiences into physical activities is explored, highlighting how higher consciousness can be accessed even during physical pursuits." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_integration_of_spiritual_experiences_into_physical_activities_is_explored,_highlighting_how_higher_consciousness_can_be_accessed_even_during_physical_pursuits."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the integration of spiritual experiences into physical activities is explored, highlighting how higher consciousness can be accessed even during physical pursuits.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What’s interesting to me is, so, I’ll go after this, and, you know, I’ll spend a little time with the family, and then I’m going to go out for a run on the trails. And I’m going to go out for a run on the trails, and I’m going to be in this bliss state, this joy state, and all of a sudden, ideas from higher consciousness are going to come to me—ideas as if I was meditating while I’m actually even more playing in the physical. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There is no—this is all one. It’s all one, absolutely. And the more you deeply investigate your true self, the more what you just described happens because it is one. Because you’ve begun to awaken, actually, to see form for what it is. You can deeply engage form even as larger parts of yourself rise up and touch or whisper or whatever. It’s even bilocation—sounds crazy to some people, but it’s actually possible to experience being exactly where you are, seeing out your eyes, doing something, and also to be somewhere else at the same time. You know, that kind of experience can just naturally happen when we’re less form-associated.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Have you done that yourself?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Um, not recently. I have experienced that briefly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, okay. Yeah, I’ve had students say that I visited them, and I’m like, “Not on a conscious level.” So, on the—yeah, so I was talking about conscious at the human level bilocation, but at the soul level, we are multilocational all the time. I don’t know if that’s a word, but like, we do interact with each other’s higher selves. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I’ve actually done that, um, a number of times where I’ve interacted with the higher portion of a person and then try to confirm it with them physically, and it’s really interesting. Um, that yes, we really are connected. We really can interact with the higher self of someone, and, and I find a very easy way that we can do this is if you find yourself finishing somebody else’s sentence, if you find yourself saying something the other person was going, “I was just thinking that myself,” I feel like you’re having a conversation up here—for use of up and down—and that’s coming out here, but it’s confirmation that, uh, there’s this other conversation already going on.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Telepathic Connections" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Telepathic_Connections"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Telepathic Connections</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the telepathic connections between individuals are explored, emphasizing the oneness and interconnectedness of all beings." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_telepathic_connections_between_individuals_are_explored,_emphasizing_the_oneness_and_interconnectedness_of_all_beings."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the telepathic connections between individuals are explored, emphasizing the oneness and interconnectedness of all beings.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so, we’re already telepathically connected with everybody else because they are us. You know, we are all one. That doesn’t mean you’re not you. You are you; you’re precious, individuated, but you’re also one with the whole. And so, like, in higher systems, communication is all telepathic. It’s complete, full, transparent, you know, not up for misinterpretation. It’s very, very full and complete. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That connectedness remains between us all the time. And like, I recently had a one-on-one with somebody where I was, you know, really feeling into them and feeling this great challenge they’re going through in their life, and I was sharing what I was feeling, and I remember she said something like, “Well, what are you doing?” And all I could say in that state of consciousness was, “Well, you are a part of me. I’m just looking at that part of me.” So, that’s how it is with all of us. We are parts of each other. So, even if we don’t know it at the human level, we’re already communicating with those around us—like, your partner, your spouse, your girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever. You and that person are probably already having quite a bit of dialogue that you may not be aware of.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, here’s what you don’t want to do—and not that we don’t want to do anything—but I remember after my first near-death experience, and I could feel this oneness, this connection to all, and, you know, it starts to fade, but it’s there. And, um, I would have an interesting experience with somebody—maybe there’s somebody who had more, quote-unquote, power over me or something, whatever that means—and I would start looking at them really funny and like trying to see—you don’t do this—but really, what I was trying to do is feel them without knowing that I can actually just stop and be still, and I’m feeling them. And once I learned that—that you can actually plug into somebody else’s energy just in the moment, just by being present—oh, changes everything.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, it does, and it’s beautiful. And you know what that reminds me of actually is, um, the last few years, I’ve attended—the last two years in person—I’ve attended the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS) National Conference. Um, this past year, it was in Phoenix; last year, it was in Washington, D.C. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There’s about 700 people present, and the majority of them have all had some type of experience—whether near-death experience or out-of-body experiences, whatever—pre-birth experiences in my case. And they—everybody—there’s this arrival of connectedness that doesn’t need to be said. It’s just there. And the energy—it’s so beautiful. And for five days or something—four or five days—at least how I experience it is just genuine connectedness and love. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And that is the natural way, and actually, that’s the direction humanity is headed, by the way, circling back to the awakening. Like, we are headed in that direction where we actually feel that connectedness more consciously every day.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, there’s a book I’m starting right now—um, I wrote it this past year. It didn’t work out; we’re restarting it. Um, and it will work out—meaning, I got through to the ending, and the way it was edited didn’t work. There’s—the energy has shifted and changed so much just in the last year alone, which is—which is a book on, “All right, you just had your WTF experience. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now what? How do we integrate this? How we’re learning—we’re all having these awakening experiences. We don’t have a clue what to do with it. We try to shut it down; that doesn’t work well. Who and what am I? Where do I go from here with this?”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, that’s a very personal question because the way that we each engage with the world of form is unique because each soul is unique. Each physical journey is unique. Each of us have hang-ups that might be unique, you know? My challenge might be no challenge at all for you or for somebody else. You know, we all have our own specific way of processing form and qualities of being. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, when we then have a WTF moment—well, there’s different ways I can interpret that, but a crisis or an awakening, you know, and that which can be a crisis, you know—then, how do you handle that? Well, it really has to do with what is your evolving relationship with form—with the world, with your body, with the thoughts in your mind, with your conditioning, with your story. And then, it’s a move towards alertness and a move towards freedom and vulnerability, but that takes courage. It takes willingness to feel. It takes a real processing of experience, yeah, that can be no joke.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, my. I share it all the time, and we’ll pull out the bleep key, but integration is a—to go from this multi-dimensional—it’s like, it’s why you hit the reset button when you were coming in here, and why myself—I’m convinced the doctors had to pull me out with tongs from mom—forgive me, everybody—and I had a temporary cone head because I’m saying, “Take me back. This is too tight of a suit. It doesn’t fit me. It’s very, very limiting.” Now, it’s not actually charged, but it is extremely limiting. And what I mean by that is, we actually apply the meaning.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, I’m lifting that up because one of the things we’re here to do is, okay, now that you’re in a super tight suit, now that you’re super limited, and you cannot jump more than two feet in the air, and you have to go through linear time, and your body gets old and sick, you know, maybe, and you have this context and all these limitations of Earth—now, what do you do? You know, what quality of intention do you wield, and what meaning do you apply? Those are the two main angles—like, how, what types of choices do you make? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Can you make a choice that’s loving, fearless, of freedom, of peace, even when the constraints are tight? You know, that’s the real question. And can you recognize that, “Oh, this limiting set—it may be even painful, but it’s neutral. So, what meaning do you put on it? How do you meet that present moment with meaning or with belief?” Like, take belief—what is your relationship to belief? That alone is such a huge topic. There’s so many people that are wielding belief, utilizing belief in a way that’s very egoic, you know. So, like, what is your relationship even to previous belief systems? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, that takes a lot of courage to look back and go, “Wow, I, boy, I think I had it wrong.” I went through that. At my during my awakening, man, I took so much humility and courage to say, “You know what? This belief system that I put all this energy into for 30 years, it’s not what I thought. It’s bigger than this.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Are you still—I’ll speak for myself personally, and I want to say this in a very non-judgmental way, but I keep realizing even as a, quote-unquote, teacher—these are all dis-labels—that everything I thought was wrong, and then everything I thought was wrong, but wrong isn’t even the right word. It’s just an expansion—too small.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, thank you. Yeah, just too small. That’s all. It’s not wrong; it’s just too small. Yes, yeah. And I imagine you’re going through the same thing. So, look back, and certainly, what you thought 30 years ago isn’t what you think today, but even what you thought last year isn’t what you think today, and what you think today—because everything’s moving so much faster—it’s probably not what you’re going to think tomorrow.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, that’s true. And the movement though is in this direction. I’ll just put it this way—in the direction of that which does not change. It’s in the direction of the beingness that has no limitation and is total love and peace and freedom and joy forever, amen—like, total bliss. So, that is the—it’s like an unshackling towards that. You know, it’s like an expansion out of small boxes, maybe even to bigger boxes, eventually towards complete freedom.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Evolving Beliefs and Expansion" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Evolving_Beliefs_and_Expansion"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Evolving Beliefs and Expansion</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the evolution of beliefs and the expansion of consciousness are discussed, highlighting the movement towards freedom and unshackling from limiting beliefs." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_evolution_of_beliefs_and_the_expansion_of_consciousness_are_discussed,_highlighting_the_movement_towards_freedom_and_unshackling_from_limiting_beliefs."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the evolution of beliefs and the expansion of consciousness are discussed, highlighting the movement towards freedom and unshackling from limiting beliefs.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, now, speaking of boxes, um, I just picked up on this tiny little sleight-of-hand comment from earlier, so please forgive me. You said, “Old and sick, maybe.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I said maybe because sickness is not even guaranteed. We will get older, yeah. I’m just lifting up that it’s not necessarily true that sickness is part of the game. Now, it is often—it’s very common in the physical to experience sickness. I’m just qualifying that because consciousness is first; the physical is second. So, there’s never actually like a pre-ordained, you know, physical outcome. We—it’s important that we retain the primacy of power where it is, which is in spirit itself, consciousness itself. Now, practically speaking, of course, illness arises. It’s quite common, you know, in this condition. And then, we just—then, we that’s a new constraint. Then, we just choose, “Okay, how do I meet this?” You know, that’s all we have to do.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you. So, let’s talk about duality. Let’s play with this for a brief moment here. So, um, I can say that this is not real; this is a simulation, and I can go buy the greatest gas guzzler in the world, rip out the catalytic converter, whatever, and just have it belching fumes everywhere, going down the road, saying, “None of this mattered.” I didn’t say it doesn’t matter.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, yeah, well, that’s where I’m getting at. How do we balance that because if I could ask the question, “Does Earth need to be saved?” and you would say, “Well, there is no needing to save the Earth,” on the other hand, it all matters energetically. Help me understand.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sure, so, the shared dream that we’re all experiencing is a real experience. It’s not fundamentally real form, but you’re having an experience; I’m having an experience; and 7.9 or so billion other players that are humans are having an experience, and all the beings who are experiencing being animals are having an experience. There’s a lot of experience of consciousness, which is real, having an experience. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And love, okay, is a call to actualize—to actualize the best for every other being, every other part of yourself, and the entirety of the whole. Love is a call of service to them. It’s about putting them first, actually. It’s about serving them. Service is our calling, and service means actualizing. Okay, so, that means though, even though it’s a dream, how can I make this a better dream for myself and for others? Love is about responsibility. Quality of intention is action. It means action. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Intention is the primary movement; it’s the primary important thing. But if you intend to lift your arm, you will lift your arm, assuming you have the physical ability to lift your arm, you know? Intention means action. So, a loving intention means we will see where the world needs us or what behaviors we might change or how we might help the person next to us. Like, like this conversation, you know? </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like, here we are just having a conversation, but what we’re doing is we’re choosing to share and to talk, to share not only information, not only talking, but the love, the energy. I feel your energy; I feel your love. It’s beautiful. And others, hopefully, when—if others hear this, they will feel their own love and the love that is all of us. And that helps that energetically to appear locally into the local system. And then, not only that, but then we physically take action in the local system. You know, those two things are related.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Quality of Intention" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Quality_of_Intention"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Quality of Intention</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the quality of intention is highlighted as a form of action, discussing how loving intentions can have a ripple effect on both energetic and physical levels." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_quality_of_intention_is_highlighted_as_a_form_of_action,_discussing_how_loving_intentions_can_have_a_ripple_effect_on_both_energetic_and_physical_levels."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the quality of intention is highlighted as a form of action, discussing how loving intentions can have a ripple effect on both energetic and physical levels.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, I’m watching this boat go by, and I’m thinking of throwing a stone into the water because that’s what our conversation is, but it’s actually—man, if I take one quote away from today, it’s, “Your quality of intention is your action.” If we understand that, we put out with energy first. If you put out the energy of love, that is an action, and that has, as behind me, massive ripple effect.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, and I guess I meant that in two ways though because the way I originally meant was, um, it means that you will take physical action, but absolutely what you just said is true—that the quality of intention automatically has an energetic effect. The physical only actualizes and manifests well in accordance with the rule set, which is quite limited and dense, but it is a probabilistic simulation. It’s not objective. So, what that means is consciousness is always pushing on how the unfolding is happening, and that is energetic. And in other words, your intention itself affects physical outcome. It does.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Well, and now, if I’m thinking love—if I’m—and so, I’ve got my little prayer stone here, and I’m constantly going, “I send love, I send love, I send love.” If I am doing that from an energetic point of view enough, and somebody cuts me off, or somebody is having a rough day, or somebody or something—anything—I am more likely to take—and here’s that action—an action out of love because that is the energy that I’ve been bathing in or the quality of my intention.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, definitely. In both planes—both in the non-physical energetic plane, you are already doing something, but then in the physical plane, which is just another layer of the same energy—ultimately, it’s ultimately consciousness—but in the physical dense plane, yes, we will then take a loving action that maybe we otherwise wouldn’t have. And, by the way, like, if we notice ourselves—part of awakening and taking responsibility for our crap means taking responsibility for what we see ourselves doing. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, if you notice, “Oh, I was a little bit rude to that person,” or even, “I feel irritated,” like, you know, sometimes I feel irritated, but if I feel irritated, I might say, “Okay, why? Where is the perception at the root because there’s a fear down there. There’s an egoic response. Irritation is an egoic response; it’s not the peace of being.” So, we become more alert so that we can actually then read our own behavior and the world around us and the responses of others as a way of valuable feedback, actually, to learn, like, “Oh, how can I actually choose love or do—where do I have an unhealed part of myself yet?” Yeah, it’s a useful feedback loop.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Authority and Love" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Authority_and_Love"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Authority and Love</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where the true nature of authority as love and wisdom is discussed, contrasting it with current institutionalized systems and emphasizing the power of love to erode fear." dir="auto" class="heading" id="Where_the_true_nature_of_authority_as_love_and_wisdom_is_discussed,_contrasting_it_with_current_institutionalized_systems_and_emphasizing_the_power_of_love_to_erode_fear."><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Where the true nature of authority as love and wisdom is discussed, contrasting it with current institutionalized systems and emphasizing the power of love to erode fear.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you. So, last night—I’m in this beautiful neighborhood here where, um, there is apparently—and I don’t want to give it too much fuel—a real, in quotes, possibility of them knocking down a whole bunch of trees to straighten the roads, cut out the forest, and pave through paradise. And so, I go to a city hall meeting last night, and I had the same sickly feeling—forgive me, everybody—that I’ve had when tromping the hallowed halls of Congress. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And I was gifted to go through the hallowed halls in Congress and literally go on a train—I rode a train, didn’t speak with her—with Hillary Clinton in this little tram with me many, many years ago. And there was a very interesting energy there and a very interesting energy of power. And I know that you’ve experienced this on the other side of the veil, and I feel as our energy is changing, our understanding of authority gets to change, and people—both authority saving, but what this future system looks like. So, really throwing a lot on you there. Take it from here, Christian.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, no, absolutely. And I understand what you’re lifting up because, in the higher systems, authority is love and wisdom. They’re synonymous. So, like, in my pre—when I was a young child, actually, that was one of the assumptions I just assumed would be true on Earth—that the higher of in a position of authority somebody was, the more loving and wise they would be naturally. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, a teacher must be loving and wise, and the mayor of a city must be really loving and wise, and the president of the United States must be the most loving and wise person. That is just what I assumed to be true here. Now, that’s not currently the case on Earth—without judgment, we get it—without right, it’s not currently the case because the—we’ll just call it the average vibration or the mean vibration on Earth is quite low by comparison to those realms. So, our institutionalized systems—the systems that have succeeded and endured—even our businesses, they’re really based in a lot of old thinking—us-versus-them thinking, controlling power-type thinking. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When I was in Washington, D.C., for the IANDS conference, the Pentagon was across the street—like, literally, like, out the window was the Pentagon. So, here we were, you know, 700 or so people just sharing so much authentic love, and across the street was the Pentagon. I could feel that interesting difference. It’s not a judgment; it’s just that there’s a normalcy that’s been kind of enshrined there of a certain pattern of thinking, a certain energy. That’s all. And so, but the true power is love. That is true even if all 100 people around you don’t understand. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You know, like, when what comes to mind is Jesus, actually. You know, when Jesus was hanged on a cross, it was about the act of love. It’s about love. It’s not about whether or not those people understood because love is quite independent and free from scope. It’s quality; it’s a quality, you see. And so, as we really truly align with that quality, it has—because it is the true ultimate spiritual power that precedes the physical—even if it takes a very long time because the physical is slow at manifesting, okay? Even if it takes a long time, the power of that love erodes fear. It’s like wind or rain on dirt or shale. Like, if you arrive in authenticity in love, gently, repeatedly, it tends—even if the other person doesn’t recognize it at first consciously—they will at the soul level, you see. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And not only at the individual level, but even the energy of the space, the energy of the work, it can’t help but sense that and be eroded by it. And so, I’ve seen that where it’s like, if you just arrive with love, you don’t actually have to expect an outcome. If you simply arrive with that quality of intention, you’re actually already free, you know, because love is freedom. It’s already free. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So, if you arrive with that, it almost—I don’t want to say it doesn’t matter what happens, but that’s the freedom of how you arrive is that it doesn’t actually matter. We just arrive how we arrive with love, and then, the other individuals—the other parts of ourselves that are also growing and learning—they will make their choices, you see. And it’s okay if they make certain choices. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We are free-willed beings; we’re here to make choices. They might not make a loving choice immediately, but at least if you provide the candle, you know, at least if you provide the strength—because love is like a form of strength; it’s like power—at least if you arrive and provide that tiny little package of power, it might encourage them—whether right now or in one day or in 10 years or in the next lifetime, actually—to choose love as well and to face their own crap and to participate in evolution. Oh, it’s beautiful. Like, we are empowered to do that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And to me, it’s very real. If you see somebody—like, if I saw people at the meeting last night, and I was—I went to a gas—which I didn’t, but you had to remind yourself to stay in a state of love. Um, but if I surrendered—for lack of another word—that, “Here’s what I’d like,” but I let go even of that, I believe it’s actually more likely to happen because they can feel the energy of resistance.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yes, you’re right. Yes, yeah. And that’s one of the beautiful things—like, if when we truly arrive with love, we don’t require the other person to change. And that’s beautiful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, so, before we wind things down, and I want to send everybody to your work, what—based on this conversation—what is pulling on your heart to share with people that I may not have covered yet?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="**Choosing Love in a Noisy World**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Choosing_Love_in_a_Noisy_World**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Choosing Love in a Noisy World</strong></h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Where Christian encourages listeners to prioritize inner peace and connection with spirit amidst the distractions of daily life.

He emphasizes the importance of meditation, presence, and choosing love as a way to navigate the challenges of the physical world.</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah, what’s been pulling on my heart lately is there’s a lot of small stuff that’s really loud lately. It’s up to you to actually make the specific choice to take time away from the loud small things and to focus deeply within and on the peace—even for 40 minutes, the meditation—to take time for meditation or to take time outside for 12 minutes and to appreciate that beautiful flowing water behind you. I’m just lifting that up because we often think, “Oh, I can’t go do that because look at all these really important things.” </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Our thoughts even seem really important, you know? All the daily things that we got to do—really important, really important. Boss, you got to pay attention to this; you better pay attention to this. This is just a gentle reminder. It’s okay. You are actually empowered to stop, to sit down, or to stand, or whatever you prefer, and to be present and to be alert. That choice is powerful. It opens a space. So, lately, I felt like there’s so much loud little stuff kind of drawing people’s attentions, and it’s okay to, as the individual—don’t worry about the whole collective—just for you, take that time away. Look inward; look to yourself. Connect with spirit; connect with nature—whatever that calling is—and do that consistently, you know. And that really, that really helps practically speaking.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Woohoo! Thank you, thank you!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You're welcome. So, Christian, where can people go to find out more, to find your book, to find your beautiful work?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sure, thank you. My website is AWalkInThePhysical.com, and the book is available online for free at the third link down on the book page on that website. So it's not about money, it's just there—you just, anybody can click on it. It's an online PDF. It is available on Amazon in print or Kindle, or on Audible. Those are not free, but it's available in all those forms.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The book is a reality model. I'm trying to speak to what our higher nature is and what the human experience is—what we're doing here, and how we can best sense who we really are. How can we process our fear and live in love while we're here? You know, that's really what it's about. My website also has a number of talks that I've participated in.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'm also happy to try to respond to emails, but I often cannot get to them—I get a lot of emails. But it's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:AWalkInThePhysical@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="mailto:AWalkInThePhysical@gmail.com" target="_blank">AWalkInThePhysical@gmail.com</a>.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thank you! What's your mission right now?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Oh, oh, my mission is to choose love. And that means, for me, that I am so impassioned about reminding people of who we really are and that we don't need to be afraid. I'm not fooled by the density of the dream. Love is—like, the freedom of our true nature is the best news. It's so empowering. I am just so, like, kind of fearless now about hopefully reaching out to everybody that I can to remind them: you are a powerful, multidimensional being of love. It's not just a weird spiritual woo-woo thing—it's just like physics. It's just what you are. And so I'm so passionate about that because if even one person feels more empowered while we're here in the physical, that is the coolest. It's just amazing work.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Also, we're living at a really interesting time right now. Like, everybody who's listening today just felt this nudge come through—just be aware. We are living in a super interesting, very unique, very "coolest corner in the universe"-type moment, actually, on Earth during The Awakening. It is an honor to be here right now. So don't feel disempowered—you are important. You are part of the awakening process. And if you just choose love and peace and joy and freedom in your own way, in your own life, in whatever small way, and be your authentic self, you are helping that momentum grow. And that is a powerful service. So, yeah, that's the most important thing I think I can live.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Woohoo! So, I just had a weird—I'll share this, then we'll wind this down. I'm both very present with you, staying plugged in at the same time, and I'm usually going, "I send love, I send love, I send love." And then I started to go, "Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you, God." And what "Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you, God." means is—I'm recognizing the Divine speaking through you right now. I'm recognizing that you are all of that. And I couldn't help but go there without conscious thought. It was really cool.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Christian: We all are. It's definitely not me—there's not a separate person that gets credit or something. It's just what we are. And that's the beautiful thing—when any of us can be that with each other, then everyone can be free. And that is awesome. Like, love—like, service—is its own reward. Love is its own beautiful reward. Something like that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Any last words of wisdom you want to share with people? You may have just done that.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yeah. Just one last thing—thank you for being human today. Not many people probably say that, but it really is a service to be here at this time. I know it's not easy at times. So, thank you for being here, and know that there's nothing to fear. And that's it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Woohoo! Thank you so much, Christian. So, for everyone out there, this is Michael Sandler saying—be well, have fun, enjoy the meat suit, be human with all that you've got, and send love, send love, send love. And above and beyond all else—shine bright!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Woohoo! How does it get any better than this? Thank you so much, Christian. You know, I say "Wow, wow, wow" after all shows, but wow, wow, wow—superlatives don’t go far enough. This was a really deep one. This was a "fasten your seatbelt"—Christian is real. Christian has it going on. He has a great understanding of who and what you are, who and what I am, who and what all of us are. And so this was, to me, a very magical interview with a very special soul.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">On that note—if you want to dive even deeper, if you want to learn who you are at the highest level and bring your energy up, up, up, and way up, click that link below and join the School of Mystics.
